It's the initials for the British intelligence spying agency." As a result, Spicer posited, there would be "no American fingerprints on this."

The British were outraged, naturally, at being accused by their closest ally of illegally spying on Trump after both the Democratic and Republican heads of the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that there were "no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance" by the U.S. government, much less wiretapping. The normally secretive G.C.H.Q. issued a rare public statement denying Spicer's claim and demanding an apology from the White House.

"Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about G.C.H.Q. being asked to conduct 'wiretapping' against the then president-elect are nonsense," the British spy agency said in a notably pointed statement. "They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored." (The White House did not respond to *Vanity Fair'

*s request for comment.)

It's still not clear whether the Trump campaign was surveilled during the campaign. If so, the question of who ordered the surveillance might not matter as much as whether the surveillance was lawful.

"If the campaign on its own was wiretapped, then the question is whether the F.B.I. was properly authorized to do so," said Michael German, a former senior F.B.I. lawyer. "G.C.H.Q. is not authorized to undertake electronic surveillance of American citizens, much less to tap the phones of foreign dignitaries of the United States. But as long as the F.B.I. is investigating a crime, it can do what it needs to do to find the perpetrator."

If, on the other hand, the Bush-era document states that the government was wiretapping Trump Tower, that would have a far more serious impact on the legitimacy of his presidency. The campaign was widely reported to have been wiretapped by the Obama administration, which may have been an effort to set up a backdoor way to surveil Trump's team.

The other aspect of this that remains unclear is whether Trump was being surveilled at all. The F.B.I. attributed Trump's access to classified intelligence briefings to the fact that he was an "unwitting agent" of the Russian government, which Trump said he had no reason to doubt.

"I think it's very unfair what they're doing to our country," Trump told the Times' Mark Landler in an interview published Tuesday. "I think it's very unfair what's happened to our country by a lot of our media."

On Wednesday, Trump seemed to back away from the wiretapping allegation, tweeting, "Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!"

The wiretapping allegation is one of a number of questionable moments in Trump's first 100 days in office. After weeks of false starts on health care, his nominees have been delayed while he's been dogged by unsubstantiated claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. His administration is still reeling from the departure of his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, in the wake of his leak-driven feud with Bannon. Then there's the whole Russia thing.<|endoftext|>I'm not a feminist. I'm not even a feminist.

The White House issued an apology, but the damage was already done. The British threatened to cancel a planned state visit by President Trump next month, and the White House's talking points and briefing materials were revised to reflect the bombshell report. "In his first major interview as president-elect, Donald Trump insisted his campaign was not under surveillance by the United States during the campaign," read one of the new versions. "In fact, he said, 'Nobody that I know of,' speaking of President Obama, 'had their phones tapped.'"

"We can't give you a running commentary on every little thing that's going on," the press secretary told reporters on Thursday. "So we just take it at face value that he was asked about it. The president-elect was very clear, he didn't feel that he was under surveillance in any way, shape, or form."

Since Trump has yet to issue any sort of official statement on his Twitter account, the press secretary's claim is largely speculation. An official statement on the issue will have to come from the president himself, which he has not done. It was not immediately clear if Trump would agree to an interview with *Vanity Fair'*s new cover story.<|endoftext|>The United States and its allies have launched a major air campaign against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, but the U.S. military has been unable to enter the city of Raqqa, the capital of the militant group's self-declared caliphate.

The U.S. military has not said what troops will take part in the assault, which began Wednesday. But U.S. officials say more than 40 U.S. special operations troops are already in Syria to help advise and assist local fighters.

The operation is the first major ground operation the U.S. military has launched against Islamic State, which has been losing ground in both countries since the beginning of the year.

The U.S. military has been conducting airstrikes and raids on Islamic State targets in Syria since September, when President Barack Obama authorized the use of force against the group.

On Monday, U.S. President Barack Obama said the U.S. military had received intelligence "indicating that [Islamic State] is planning to use chemical weapons against the Syrian people."

The U.S. military said it conducted a "precision strike" on an Islamic State chemical weapons facility in northern Iraq on Wednesday and killed two Islamic State leaders.

But President Obama has warned that the U.S. military won't hesitate to use force against militants in Syria.

"Our military is on the ground in both Iraq and Syria. And we have the capacity to carry out these operations. But we are not going to be rushed into a ground war in Syria," he said.

The U.S. military has also carried out airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Libya.

The battle for Raqqa, which began Wednesday, is expected to last for weeks.

The U.S. military used drones to launch strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria as they moved toward Raqqa.

The U.S. military said they had conducted 18 airstrikes in Iraq and 10 in Syria on Wednesday, using unmanned drones, bombers, Tomahawk cruise missiles and other munitions.

The U.S. military said it also conducted 12 airstrikes in Libya early Thursday, destroying Islamic State weapons caches and vehicles.

In a statement released by the Pentagon late Wednesday, U.S. Central Command said the warplanes followed "patterns of engagement" and hit Islamic State positions and infrastructure.

While the British spy agency's statement was a little extreme, it did not comment on the substance of the allegation that G.C.H.Q. had spied on Trump. Instead, it focused on the fact that Spicer had said Trump had used G.C.H.Q. to surveil his own team. Moreover, it suggested that when the F.B.I. found out about Trump's real-estate dealings, it did so in a case in which the British were not involved.

The story of the F.B.I. surveillance is not as simple as Spicer and the British spy agency would like you to believe. In the first place, the F.B.I. declined to comment on the matter, and although the issue has been discussed in the media, there has been no definitive statement from the bureau.

(There is a reasonable argument that the bureau could have made public comments on the matter long ago.) In the second place, there are numerous reasons to believe that the British government was not the source of the surveillance. For one thing, the F.B.I. said that it had no evidence that the British were the source of any wiretapped conversations. (In a letter to Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the bureau's director, James B. Comey, said, "I have no information that supports those tweets.")

In addition, even if the British were involved, there was no evidence that they were engaged in illegal surveillance. "In fact," says Michael Morell, who was the acting director of the C.I.A. when Bush was president, "the British government was doing everything it could to help the United States in a counterterrorism effort; it was just that their way of doing that was in the shadows."

In any case, the British may have had no interest in wiretapping Trump. Most of Trump's dealings with the Russians were made before he was elected, and the British did not do anything to interfere with those. In fact, one of the main reasons that the British were investigating Trump was because they suspected that the F.B.I. had improperly spied on the Trump campaign.

"This was all about Russia," says Richard Clarke, a former C.I.A. official who was involved in the investigation of the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee. "The Russians were going after the Republicans, and the British were learning about that."

One of the reasons that the F.B.I. was investigating Trump was because they suspected that the F.B.I. had improperly spied on the Trump campaign.

The British may also have had no interest in conducting surveillance of Trump. The British are known for their aversion to the domestic surveillance of their citizens. The British have a separate criminal code for domestic spying, which is very different from the one in the United States. (American spies are more likely to be charged with espionage if they target a foreign government or an agent of a foreign government than if they target a domestic American.)

Clapper, who was the director of national intelligence during the Clinton administration, says that the British spy agency was "trying to figure out how to use that kind of authority" in the United States. "The British were asking the F.B.I. to do what they were not allowed to do, which was to violate the privacy of Americans."

The British have not publicly commented on why they were not interested in eavesdropping on Trump. One explanation is that they were not interested in Trump because they did not think he was capable of spying on them. "

==================== COMPLETION 4 ====================
*s request for comment about the claims.)

The British were also incensed that Trump's disclosures were made on Monday, the same day that G.C.H.Q. was conducting the "wiretapping" investigation, and at a time when the British were planning to conduct a major military exercise with the U.S. next week in the wake of the terror attack in Manchester, England, last week that killed 22 people, including children.

"It is a matter of deep regret that the allegations concerning GCHQ being asked to conduct 'wire tapping' against the then president elect have been leaked to the media," the agency complained. "President Trump's claim that these activities always occurred is absurd. They did not. And the Prime Minister has made clear that these activities did not happen."

Trump's claims, however, were later debunked by U.S. intelligence officials, who told the New York Times that the president had been talking about a hypothetical hotline that would allow the British to spy on the president, not a hotline for G.C.H.Q. to tap Trump directly.

Spicer's Monday press conference didn't do much to assuage the British, as the White House made no public comment on the matter, even as several of their state visits with Trump were canceled in response to the reported wiretapping.

The British ambassador to the United States, Jane Hall, was reportedly so incensed by the wiretapping allegations that she placed a call to her counterpart in Washington to complain.

"The embassy is obviously very concerned by the allegations," a British official told the Times. "The ambassador has spoken to her counterpart in Washington and has stressed that these are very serious allegations which need to be investigated."<|endoftext|>Sara and Richard Hatch are among the sisters who have joined the fight to defund Planned Parenthood. (Photo: Screen capture)

(CNSNews.com) – During a press conference on Wednesday, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said that the anti-abortion group Americans United for Life is a "rogue" group that is "on the wrong side of history" and that it has been "hijacked" by the Republican Party.

"Americans United for Life has been hijacked by the Republican Party," Richards said at the press conference. "They're on the wrong side of history on every single issue. It's been a wild ride."

Richards explained that Americans United for Life was started in 2011 by David Daleiden, who is also the founder of the Center for Medical Progress. He is also the person who captured videos of Planned Parenthood officials negotiating the sale of aborted babies' body parts, which Planned Parenthood has admitted were done for research purposes.

"We've been working to offer a different perspective on this issue that's consistent with both the law, the Constitution and the trust we have as Americans to make the best decisions for ourselves and our families," Richards said.

Richards said that Americans United for Life opposes abortion and supports the legal rights of women, including the right to choose and to obtain an abortion without being charged with a crime.

"People need to know that the organization that's been putting out the videos has been completely hijacked by someone who is on the wrong side of history on every single issue," Richards said.

Richards also said that Americans United for Life, which is funded by a number of conservative groups, is not a cohesive organization.

"There is no one person in the organization," Richards said. "There are multiple individuals with different opinions and different agendas. It's not a unified effort."

Richards said that Americans United for Life has been active for more than 40 years and has been working to "protect the right to

From November 6, the Open University will allow students to study the course with no previous knowledge of this subject area. It is the latest move by the UK's most senior public university to expand access to high-quality academic study online, helping to unlock high-skilled jobs.

The course is an extension of the Open University's flagship Open Education programme, which has been running for more than 20 years. In addition to courses in subjects like engineering and computer science, students will be able to take courses in law, business, economics and political science.

The Open University will be running the course from November 6 to November 24, with the first 500 students taking courses from November 12 to November 19.

Prof Stephen Barratt, chair of the Open University's board of governors, said: "We are delighted to be able to launch the Open Education programme in conjunction with the Open University. This is an ambitious project with a huge potential impact on the lives of those who want to learn and advance their careers.

"We want to help enable as many as possible to gain access to high-quality, world-leading education, by giving them the chance to develop their ideas and knowledge in a world-leading way. We know that more must be done to allow everyone to reach their full potential, but we want to do this in a way that does not cost the taxpayer."

The course will be available to anyone with an internet connection and will be hosted on the Open University's platform. The course will be available to anyone with an internet connection and will be hosted on the Open University's platform.

The Open Learning Community (OLC) will be responsible for the initial rollout of the course. The OLC will run the course using the Open University's data and will provide support to those taking part.

As the votes were counted, the Liberal Democrats had a total of 267 seats, six short of the 326 needed to remain in power. Mr Clegg's party was in a weak position in the House of Lords, but he had a majority there of more than 20. The Lib Dems have been weakened by a combination of the party's weakness in the polls and the withdrawal of their most vocal member, the former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Mr Clegg's departure is a bitter blow for the Liberal Democrats, who had hoped to wield greater influence.

The Liberal Democrats' weakness in the polls perhaps explains why their leader, Nick Clegg, was able to return to the Commons to support Mr Clegg's re-election. The Tories are expected to win a majority in the House of Commons, but its size is uncertain. The polls suggest a majority exceeding 100 seats for the Tories, but the actual result is highly uncertain. The Lib Dems have two MPs in the Commons, while the Tories have just one MP. The Tories' smaller number of MPs means that the Lib Dems will have to play a much larger role in key debates in the Commons. "The Lib Dems are going to have to step up to the plate in the Commons and make a difference," said one Liberal Democrat MP.

But the Lib Dems are still a minority party in the House of Commons. The Conservatives, Labour, and the SNP each have more than 50 MPs, with the SNP holding the balance of power at Westminster. The Liberal Democrats need the support of other MPs to get their legislation through the Commons and to maintain their influence in the Lords. "We are going to have to work very hard to ensure that we're not just content with a minority position in the Commons," said a Liberal Democrat MP.

The Tories are expected to win a majority in the House of Commons, but its size is uncertain. The polls suggest a majority exceeding 100 seats for the Tories, but the actual result is highly uncertain

The Liberal Democrats were also badly damaged by the decision to re-elect Mr Clegg as leader. He was an unpopular figure with many voters, and his leadership of the party was always likely to be a political disaster before the election. The party was divided over whether or not to support Mr Clegg, and many Lib Dem MPs were deeply unhappy about the arrangement between Mr Clegg and Mr Clegg's deputy, Nick Clegg. Mr Clegg's popularity, however, was far from universally repugnant. A large number of voters in the south of England, many of whom had suffered as a result of the economy, didn't mind that Mr Clegg had resigned as Deputy Prime Minister.

Mr Clegg's unpopularity was compounded by the decision by the Liberal Democrats to support the Government's austerity measures. The party was forced to defend its decision to support cuts in public services in the face of accusations that it was part of a Conservative "anti-business" coalition. The party, which suffers from low voter turnout, was also forced to defend its decision to vote against the Government's welfare reforms.

It was not until the recent Government scandals, such as the phone hacking scandal, that voters saw the Liberal Democrats as a party that genuinely cared about the welfare of the poor and the unemployed. But voters are now seeing the Liberal Democrats as an out-of

WKBN Staff - DEKALB COUNTY, Ill. (WKBN) - A DeKalb County judge scheduled a trial for a former DeKalb County sheriff's deputy accused of raping a 17-year-old girl.

The DeKalb County State's Attorney's office filed felony charges against Deputy Adam Mims, 31, in December for allegedly raping the teen in July 2016.

Mims was arrested last month after another suspect he had arrested, a man named William Moore, confessed to the crime.

Moore was accused of stealing the teen's phone and then sexually assaulting her. He was also charged with obstructing justice for allegedly lying to a police officer about the rape.

Mims is due back in court on Feb. 1.<|endoftext|>Here's another one of the best female-led superhero movies in recent memory. Director Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman is a lush, gorgeous film that feels like no other feature film I've seen this year.

Wonder Woman is a poignant, cinematic epic that takes place a week in the life of Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), a young woman who has the ability to control and shape reality through her bracelets/handcuffs/wand. In the film, a steel-clad Amazon warrior named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) drive into the city to save Diana from a terrorist attack.

Wonder Woman is about a young girl who learns how to wield the power she has and also how to protect those around her. It's a story that has never been told before, and it's an incredible feat of storytelling.

It's a film that balances a story about girls who fight for justice with a love story.

It's a film that's filled with fantastically imagined moments and moments of real power.

It's a film that has a story about a young girl who learns how to wield the power she has and also how to protect those around her. It's a story that has never been told before, and it's an incredible feat of storytelling.

In a year full of amazing superhero movies, Wonder Woman is the one I'm most excited about. Jenkins has done a great job of making a film that feels very unique. It's a film that's filled with fantastically imagined moments and moments of real power.

The film begins with Diana riding through the streets of Paris. The movie's opening credits are a montage of photos of Paris that we all know and love. It's a nice little homage to the important events that happened during World War II. The credits then cut to a shot of Diana riding in a car as she arrives at her desk.

She's immediately in full-on action mode, as she grabs her key and unlocks her new car. In a nice subtle nod to the reader, while Diana is in the car she's signing a gay pride flag.

The administration has not ruled out military action but has not committed to it, and top officials have regularly raised the possibility of diplomatic means, including sanctions.

In the past, Trump has defended Pyongyang as a "friend" of the US. But Trump's comments this week suggest that the US may be ready to abandon that friendship for a new approach.<|endoftext|>When I was in college, I used to go on a lot of hikes. I remember going to Camp Blanding, the most popular campus hike at the time. The drive up to the top was long and the hike itself was nothing special. It was just a couple of miles, but what made the hike memorable was the view. The rocks and trees were so close together that I could see the telegraph poles that were still standing and the tall buildings of the university that were still standing in the distance.

The views of the mountains, the rocks and trees, and the buildings and telegraph poles are the views in every hike I take. I want to take more walks, but it's hard to imagine a hike where you can see all of that, but there's no way I'm doing that hike.

I'm going to take a lot of hikes in 2015, but some of them will be on a shorter scale. I'm going to try and go on a shorter hike every day. It's exciting to think about it, but it's really hard to imagine doing it. I don't have the time to be out hiking every day of the week. I'm starting to think that I should just go on a short hike every day. I've been thinking about how I could do it, but I've never actually done it.

My first thought when I thought of taking a shorter hike every day was to go on a hike that wasn't too long. That's something I have always wanted to do, but I've never been able to do. It's something I would love to do, but it just doesn't happen all that often. I would love to hike the Appalachian Trail, but I'd never be able to do it. I would like to hike some of the shorter trails in the Pacific Northwest, but I'd never be able to do that either.

My next thought was to hike the Gulf Coast Trail. I've done the Gulf Coast Trail twice and I'm really excited to do it again, but it's a hike that I have never been able to do. I've thought about doing it a few times, but I never really got around to it.

I'm going to take a hike that's not too long. It's going to be a shorter hike than I normally take, and it's going to be something I really want to do. I think it's going to be a great way to get outside and see the outdoors. I'm going to hike the Appalachian Trail, but I'm going to hike the Gulf Coast Trail.

The Gulf Coast Trail is an 11,200-foot trail that winds through the Gulf Coast region of Florida. The trail begins in the city of St. Augustine, Florida, and ends in the town of Gulf Shores. The Gulf Coast Trail is a great way to hike the Gulf Coast region and see a lot of the coastal areas of Florida.

I'm going to hike the Gulf coast Trail on a Monday. I'm going to hike the Gulf Coast Trail on a Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I'm going to hike the Gulf Coast Trail on a Friday, and I'm going to hike the Gulf Coast Trail on a Saturday. That's it. I'm

 in late December, and the program was summarized for Trump by the military.

The focus of the Trump program is to "demonstrate to North Korea that the US is prepared to use force if they continue to threaten the United States and our allies," the official said.

Officials described a "credible military option," including enhanced naval and air capabilities, to deter and prevent North Korea from pursuing a nuclear weapon program and a more robust diplomatic effort to convince the country to relinquish such weapons.

Trump has previously said that he would be willing to meet with Kim Jong Un under certain circumstances, but said he has no intention of doing so.

The United States should maintain its military capability -- including a blockade of North Korea's reclusive capital of Pyongyang -- and increase pressure on China to do more to rein in its neighbor, Trump said.

The new administration will also be seeking to expand the scope of the US role in Iraq and Syria to include the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said the United States had been "effectively supporting" the moderate Syrian opposition for more than a year.

But the White House has struggled to articulate a strategy to counter the group, and the Trump administration has been in the wake of a series of missed opportunities to do so.

The engagement under Obama was not simply an intellectual exercise. The United States had been attempting to build a coalition of countries to go after the Islamic State for years, and it had been working to change the narrative in the region.

Trump's willingness to engage with North Korea -- a country that the United States has been reluctant to engage with for more than 40 years -- will be a reminder to his aides that the United States is now more willing to try.

While the new administration will have to grapple with these issues, Trump's ability to govern will depend in large part on how he handles North Korea.

"There is a real need to make a decision, and maybe not even an easy one, but a decision, of whether you want a president who is going to be prepared to act decisively," said Harry Kazianis, a former US ambassador to the UN under Obama.<|endoftext|>Still loading...

Putin's visit

Trump will be eager to put the best face on his new relationship with Putin, whom he has praised as a strong leader who has brought peace to Syria. Putin will be visiting the US next month, and Trump, who is not expected to formally meet with the Russian president, will seek to highlight the two countries' growing alliance.

But this will be an awkward relationship for Trump to navigate, given Russia's interference in the US election and Trump's own links to the Kremlin. The two will also have to contend with lingering questions about Trump's own ties to Russia.

Russia's meddling in the election is one of the few subjects on which the White House and congressional Republicans agree on.

Trump will likely need to win over his own Republican Party to support the intelligence community's assessment that Russia sought to sway the election in Trump's favor.

Still, Trump will have to tread carefully, mindful of his comments the day after the election that he hoped Russia would find Clinton's deleted emails and the subsequent revelations that Russia facilitated the leaks.

And the question of whether Clinton's use of a private email server was an act of treason is sure to come up.

Russia's influence in the election

The Trump administration's relationship with Moscow is one of the most divisive issues in American politics, and Trump's relationship with Putin is a critical factor.

The president-elect is wary of Russia's influence over the US election. In the transition period, Trump repeatedly expressed skepticism about the intelligence community's assessment that Russia was behind the hacking.

And the US intelligence community has found that Putin personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at the US election.

Trump has disputed those findings and has insisted that he will meet with Putin during his upcoming trip to Moscow. As the US and Russia engage in one of the most important relationships in their history, the relationship could be impacted by the US's stance on Moscow.

And Trump's own comments on Russia will be a factor. While he's said in the past that he'd like to improve relations with Russia, he's also expressed views that seem to reflect Moscow's interests.

"For me, it would be an amazing thing -- not a bad thing -- if we could get along with Russia," Trump said in September. "If we can get along with people, there's nothing we can't do. It would be an amazing thing. I think it would be very, very good."

The White House is expected to offer a fuller presentation of a US strategy to the UN Security Council on Thursday.

Trump's relationship with Abdullah, who as the prime minister of Jordan became the first Arab leader to meet with Trump at the White House earlier this year, has become strained, according to the US officials. Trump's administration has made clear its preference for a stronger relationship with Saudi Arabia, a key ally of the United States.

Abdullah is also the lone Middle East leader to have met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in April, a meeting that was viewed by many in the region as a slap in the face for Israel. He was also the first foreign leader to speak to Trump after he announced the US was pulling out of the Paris climate accord.

Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Accord has been widely viewed as an act of diplomatic isolation and a move to put the US back on an equal footing with Russia, China and Iran, all of which have long been viewed as global powers.

China has already signaled its displeasure over Trump's decision, expressing disappointment over the US withdrawal from the deal and calling on other parties to respect the accord.

China has also begun pushing for more countries to sign the Paris accord, a move that could complicate Trump's efforts to make the agreement a global standard.<|endoftext|>A new study by UC Davis researchers has shown that a new class of antibiotic that's being developed by the pharmaceutical company Oxitec could help kill off mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus.

The research, published today in the journal Nature Communications, is a step toward developing a broad-spectrum antibiotic that could be used to prevent infections from viruses from other diseases such as Ebola, which are spread by Aedes to humans.

The research team has shown that Oxitec's tool, a genetically modified version of the bacterium Wolbachia, kills mosquitoes infected with the Zika virus.

Oxitec's new pesticide, called YatriX, is one of the first of its kind to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in the U.S.

"This study is a great step forward in developing a new class of antibiotic that can kill Zika-carrying mosquitoes," said Daniel Scarpinato, assistant professor of entomology at UC Davis and senior author of the paper. "We hope that our findings may one day lead to the development of new Zika-specific drugs, which could potentially be used to treat the disease and prevent disease transmission."

The Zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and can cause severe birth defects in fetuses and young children. It's believed to have led to a spike in cases of microcephaly in Brazil. Zika also is suspected in the birth defects in more than 1,000 babies in the continental U.S. that have been born with microcephaly, said Scarpinato.

The Zika virus' link to birth defects has prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency, and concerns about the virus are growing in the U.S. as well.

Oxitec is one of several companies that have developed genetically modified mosquitoes to fight Zika, and the company's research shows that Wolbachia's offspring are less likely to transmit the virus.

"We're excited to see a new class of antibiotics that could help prevent Zika infections in humans," said Scarpinato. "Our study shows that Wolbachia's offspring can be controlled and that the Wolbachia-derived antibiotic is effective against Zika."

 be fresh and lively. The remedy is to give the whole field a good washing, and bring the field up to the proper temperature. This will enable the chicks to stand their winter quarters; and if they are landed with proper care, they will all be in good condition. It is advisable to remove the eggs from the nest as soon as possible; as the chicks grow up, they will become quite fond of the eggs, and will steal them from the hen, and even seek them out in the nest, in defiance of the owner. The hen is therefore recommended to be very careful, in cleaning out the nest, and to keep the eggs clean, which she will be able to do by keeping the nest well covered. If the chicken has been kept in a good little cage, it will easily get out, but if she is confined in a house, she is at a great disadvantage. Mince can be given to the hen in any quantity, and with any quantity of meat; but as the quantity will be small, it will soon be a nuisance to the little bird. The above article is stated to be a very good one, but it is not an exact description. The author says, that in order to get the best flavour, it will be necessary to fry in butter the whole of the croquettes, but that he does not know what is the best way for that purpose. J. B. F. EMBLEMS. Corned Beef. — If the price of beef is high, a boiled corned beef dinner will be more agreeable to the eye, and taste, than any other dish. It is a good dish to be eaten cold, but it will do well hot with gravy. RICE. — The rice for this dish is very similar to that for the meat, and should be boiled in the same quantity, not less than half and half. It should be stirred into the stock or broth in the same manner. It can be made up into balls, and fried in the same manner as the ribs. Cabbage of any kind will do well for this purpose, as it is a very good condiment. A small piece of it should be put in with the meat, and when the meat is nicely browned, it should be removed and set aside. This is called "cabbage of the wine," and will be found very agreeable with all kinds of meat. The liver of the animal should be removed, and the liver of the bird, also, should be removed. The liver of the bird should be removed, and chopped into small pieces, and mixed with the oil that is left in the pot. The liver of the animal should be finely chopped, and mixed with the remaining gravy. This is called "cabbage of the liver." This is a very good dish to be served in company with the rice, and is much preferred by English cooks, but it will do well by itself. The bird should be carefully cleaned and washed, and then immediately placed in the pot with the sauce, the liver of the bird being used in the same manner. This should be added to the rice, without separating the meat or vegetable portions. In making these croquettes, the meat should be finely chopped, and mixed with the gravy of the croquettes. The vegetable portions should be placed on the left side, and the meat on the right side. The left side should be cleared of the green parts, the pieces for the croquettes being placed upon them. The gravy should be of a light colour, and should be made up into balls for the croquettes. The meat should be cooked until the meat is rather brown, and then the croquettes should be cooked until they are quite dry. The bones should be removed from the croquettes, and the

 be firm and pliable. In order to prevent this, the hen should be kept in a warm, dry place, so that the birds may have plenty of good air to breathe. If they are kept in a cold, damp place, they may readily get "chip," but, if kept in a warm, dry place, it is much less frequent. The best way is to keep the hen and the young chicks in a warm, dark place, with a good, deep, well ventilated, well screened porch. This is a very practical and inexpensive method of preventing "chip," and no bird can be kept with more peace of mind. When the chicks are about a month old, and are sufficiently hatched to be able to fly, the mother should be taken from the nest, and the young ones, making sure not to disturb the mother, should be submerged in a large basin of water, and kept warm in it for at least six hours. The water may be changed every two hours. If the young birds remain in the water, they will die. If they are kept at the same time in the basin, and are not able to fly, they should be put into a cool place, and then allowed to dry out, without being exposed to the sun. When completely dry, they can be taken out, and left to dry in a warm, dry place. When the eggs are hatched, it is generally best to place them in a dry place, as soon as they are hatched, and give them plenty of air to breathe. If they are kept in a warm place, they will die. When the eggs have hatched, and the young birds have flown about, it is well to place them in a warm, dry place, with plenty of air to breathe, or they will become very weak. The best way to prevent "chip" is to keep the young birds in a warm, dry place, and when they are about the same size, they should be placed in the same situation, in the same place, and kept in the same condition for a few days. If they are kept in a cold, damp place, they will die. It is a good plan to keep the young birds in a warm, dry place, with plenty of air to breathe, for a few days, and then change them into a cool place, and then into a warm one, in the same place. If they are kept in a warm, damp place, they will die. If the young birds are found to be weak, it is a good plan to keep them in a warm, dry place, and if they are weak, they should be taken out and laid in a cool place, and allowed to dry out, without being exposed to the sun. If they are kept in a cold, damp place, they will die. If the young birds are weak, then they should be taken out and laid in a cool place, and kept in a warm one for a few days, and then change them into a cool place, if the young birds are weak. The young birds may be kept in the same place, and chosen according to their strength, and be transferred from one place to another. The following is the proper way to place young birds, and to prevent them from becoming weak : Take the young birds and half-sized egg from the nest and put them in a warm, dry place, with plenty of air to breathe. If they are weak, it is best to keep them in a warm, dry place, where they will have plenty of air to breathe. They may be changed into a cool place, and kept in a warm one, in the same place.

If this be the case, they are to be carefully handled by the parents, who will find them quite soft, and will then gently lay them on a dish, and cover them with a little water or lemonade. This will break up their chippings, and will enliven them. They may also be taken out at all seasons, and a little water mixed with lemonade or water, will fix them. If they have not been allowed to have a good "chip" for several days, they may be got by the above method. When they can be taken out, they will be very pleasant in a kind of soup, of tomato, or any other vegetable matter, with a spoonful of cream to draw the moisture from them. They also make a good cream-sauce, when used in their own manner. Batters, as "tomato," "lard," "croutons," may be added to the above recipe. HOME-PREPAREDNESS. 163. The Art of Making French Bread. — A little bread-crumb is the best crumb for French bread. But in making good French bread, the bread must be rather thin, as it is in "American" bread, and not so stiff as in English bread. When making French bread, the butter must be softened. A little lard is excellent for the same purpose. In the beginning, the butter should be softened, but as it thickens, it is much better to let it cool and soften the following day. This is best done by melting it in a saucepan, and stirring it through a sieve, and stirring it through a sieve again. It can be done the day before, but it will be much better now. The flour should be cut into very small, thin pieces, so as not to interfere with the butter. The butter should be melted, and the flour mixed with it, and worked into a paste. It is best to have the butter and the flour well mixed, and not to use more or less of either of them, than is necessary. The quantity of flour required may be determined by weighing the butter and the flour separately, and by adding one-half to two-thirds of the amount of each, to the mixture. If the butter is too dry, add a little more flour, and if too wet, add a little more butter. When the mixture is well put together, it will make a crust on the bottom of the pan. When the crust is quite dry, it is ready to be baked. The dough may be kept in a warm place for a few minutes, until it is all worked up into a smooth ball. The dough should be kept warm, and it will keep a long time without any more attention, or any alteration of the ingredients. INGREDIENTS. — 1/2 pint butter, 12 oz. sifted flour, 1/2 drachm. salt. Directions. — Melt the butter in a saucepan of water, stirring well and slowly till it is quite melted. When it is quite melted, add the sifted flour to it, and let it stand until the flour has absorbed the butter. Then add the salt, and stir well. When the dough is well mixed, and it may be kept a few minutes in a warm place, it will be ready to be rolled into a ball. Roll the ball out on a smooth surface, and cut it into thick strips, about a foot long. The length of the strips will depend upon the size of the pan in which you make the bread. The strips cannot be cut too short, because if the strips are too large, they will not be as good as they can be. The strips should not be too long, as

Mode. — Put the rice into the above proportion of cold stock or broth, and let it boil very gently for 1/2 hour; then add the butter, and simmer it till quite dry and soft When cold, make it into balls, hollow out the inside, and fill with minced fowl made by recipe No. 956. The mince should be rather thick. Cover over with rice, dip the balls into egg, sprinkle them with bread crumbs, and fry a nice brown. Dish them, and garnish with fried parsley. Oysters, white sauce, or a little cream, may be stirred into the rice before it cools. Time. — 1/2 hour to boil the rice, 10 minutes to fry the croquettes. Average cost, exclusive of the fowl, 8d. Seasonable at any time. CHIP. — If the birds are allowed to puddle about on wet soil, or to be much out in the rain, they will get "chip." Young chicks are especially liable to this complaint. They will sit shivering in out-of-the-way corners, perpetually uttering a dolorous "chip, chip;" seemingly frozen with cold, though, on handling them, they are found to

 be perfectly well. With this they should be allowed to dry out, and at once take good fresh air. A good remedy is to purchase a few of the young ones, and put them in a shallow dish, where they will not be so much alarmed. Their tiny little feet being held in the air, they will not be alarmed, and will soon go to sleep. To prevent this, they ought to be kept in a warm place, and in the shade. CHIPS. — The young chicks are usually protected, and are not only spared this unpleasant trouble, but are often let out to devour their own kind. One should be especially careful not to let them out in the open, as they will not be able to avoid getting into the mud. As soon as they are large enough for enjoyment, they should be accustomed to be kept out of the open, and kept in a warm and dry place. CHIPS. — The young ones, being kept in a warm and dry place, will not be so apt to get into the mud. At the age of about one and a half weeks, they will be capable of being taken out of the house, and let out to devour their own kind. Their small little feet being held in the air, will not be alarmed, and will soon go to sleep. To prevent this, let them be kept in a warm and dry place, and in the shade. (By J. J. H.) A COOK'S GUIDE TO LAKE AND RIVER POULTRY. — A good guide to the manufacture of the various sorts of poults. By J. J. H. (By permission of the author.) FISH. — In the river-bottom, and in the lakes, there are many varieties of fish, which should be caught by all persons who wish to be healthy and fit. They are, of course, all caught at different times of the year, and the various kinds of usuage are, therefore, very various. One kind, called "Nue," or "Chinook," is a large mussel, which is caught in the summer, and in the winter, and is very juicy, and very good. It is taken by holding it over the fire till it is pretty black and hard, and then turning it over on its side; then dropping it into a pint of water. This is the best and most convenient way of catching it, and it is very much resorted to by the Indians. It is also taken, in the winter, in the same manner, but with the flip-flop, and in a very dry place. There are two kinds of this fish, one of which is called "Punkin," and the other "Punkin-towel," and they may be considered as being the same species. The former is caught by dropping it into a pint of water, and then turning it over on its side, so that it is left in a small quantity. If the water is deep and well-frozen, the fish will float on the surface, and by raising the surface, a spark will be produced, which gives it its name. It may be taken by the same method, but the fish should not be left in the water too long, as it will become hard and brittle. The latter is taken by taking a long wooden bar, and dipping it in the water, to which it has been dipped, and then letting it float in the water till it is soft, and then placing it in a pint of water. After it has been floating there a few minutes, a spark will be made, and will give it its name. It is very good to eat. The Pekin fish is also taken by dropping it in water

Arrow's release of the Tinto Brass classic, "Caligula."


DM: What impresses me the most about Arrow's products is the amount of "extra mile" that goes into each piece. The Mutilator had been one of my "most wanted" films on DVD/BD for YEARS. People like me would have purchased that title no matter what "extras" were on it, but Arrow went above and beyond in producing a nice feature-length documentary to round out all the other bonuses that were loaded onto the package. I'm guessing a lot of what you do is a "labor of love"—how important is that, and how far are you willing to go with hunting down or producing supplemental materials before it becomes "not worth it"?


FS: The label was always intended to be the last word in whatever film we released. It was a slow start but once we got through some key releases like Dawn of the Dead and Battle Royale that became the brief for every release thereafter and so when we expanded our team we found people who not only understood that but were also passionate and knowledgeable about these films. Our team doesn't all have the same tastes but that's exactly what we need, so when we have a release like
==================== COMPLETION 17 ====================
 this that is so well done we feel that "extra mile" is worth it.


DM: You made a rare foray into the documentary field with a documentary that follows the development of the infamous "Pound Puppy" in the early days of the film industry. How important is the documentary field, and how important is it to you?


FS: The documentary field is important to me because I love the process of filmmaking. It's like a really good book, or a really good LP: it takes a lot of time to create and we're lucky to have a lot of filmmakers who will talk to us about their process, and the process of making a documentary.


I have a lot of respect for the people who make documentaries, and the people who create documentaries, because they're the best at what they do. I think it's important that as we move forward in the time we have available to us we look to the best and the brightest in film to make great films.


DM: You recently wrapped on your second feature film, the anthology-style, "Metal: A Love Story." What was the most challenging part of making that film, what made you decide to focus on it, and how did it come about?


FS: I think it was the challenge: it was a love story, it was a love story about two people who spend their lives together, who love each other, who have lost a child, and it was about the role of metal in their lives and the role of metal in their relationship. That is something that is very personal for me and something that I'm very passionate about.


It was also a challenge to make a film that felt like it was a love story, but was also a film that could be loved by a lot of people. I think that's why we made it with an interesting cast of characters: we wanted people to get involved in the story and feel like they were part of it.


We were very lucky to find a fantastic director, Scott R. Donton, who really understands what it takes to make a film like this. He understands what it takes to make a film that is both a love story and a film that people can get involved with.


When you do a film like this you have to make it for the fans, and it takes a lot to make a film like that. It's challenging on a lot of levels that I don't think a lot of filmmakers are willing to face.


DM: As a filmmaker, how do you go about finding the right cast? You have films with very large casts, and seemingly smaller casts, but how do you find the right mix of actors who are appropriate for each role?

FS: I don't think you can ever "find the right cast" because you always go with what feels right for you. You go with what feels right to you, because it is what pays off. But the cast is important to us, because it makes the film what it is.


I'm a little bit more forgiving of this than I am for some other things I've done. Sometimes people think a film is too "filler" and they don't really care about it. If I'm making a film that's going to be a good film to watch, it's not going to be about a character that isn't interesting, that's not interesting to watch.


I feel that casting is just as important as story. I have a good relationship with many of the people I've worked with, and I've worked with some wonderful people and that's important to me. But if I'm going to do a film I need to find the right people and the right actors to make the film what

Our team doesn't all have the same tastes but that's exactly what we need, so when we have a release like
==================== COMPLETION 18 ====================
 the Mutilator, we wanted to make sure the cost of it didn't compound our costs. We always try to keep the price point as low as possible and we can always bring the price up hopefully to some level where it's in line with the other films we're doing.


DM: I noticed a few years ago that it was no longer possible to purchase the "Extras" for the DVD/BDs. Was that a result of being released to Blu Ray? Did Arrow "cancel" the release for a new release?


FS: Yes, that was a result of the Blu Ray release. We always had some "extras" that were never released before on a DVD or Blu Ray, but we always planned to release those on a Blu Ray release. We never anticipated the popularity of the Extras that we pulled from "The Mutilator" and there weren't enough people to justify it to make a Blu Ray release viable.


DM: I heard that you were in negotiations for the "Extras" for Dawn of the Dead. Why didn't you release those, and what happened?


FS: Well, I was still in negotiations with Paramount to release the "Extras" for "Dawn of the Dead," but they ultimately decided not to release those "Extras" and to put those on their DVD release. So, they went home with $1.5 million worth of extras and we got nothing. I mean, that was the whole point of the "Extras" in the first place.


DM: What are the chief differences between working with a distributor like Arrow and one like Red Granite?


FS: Well, I think the biggest difference is that Arrow has a lot of trust that they can get the balance right between what the consumer wants and what they can afford. It's the same thing with Red Granite. They have no responsibility to make sure the consumer gets it exactly how they want it or at a price they can afford or that the film looks as good as they want it to look. It's up to the distributors to make sure all the right things happen.


DM: Did you have any contact with Red Granite before releasing "The Mutilator" on DVD/BD?


FS: No, I did not.


DM: Did you have any contact with Red Granite after releasing "The Mutilator" on DVD/BD?


FS: No, I did not.


DM: Do you have any idea when you might be able to release "The Mutilator" on Blu Ray?


FS: We are still in negotiations with the distributor. It's possible, but it's a matter of how much money we're willing to spend and how long it takes to get the release going.


DM: When you were saying that you were in negotiations with Paramount, were you talking about "The Mutilator"?


FS: I think what I was referring to was "The Mutilator" and "Dawn of the Dead" because it was an exception to the rule. Most of the DVDs and Blu Rays that we released in the past were more or less immediately popular with consumers. We were able to find distributors for them quickly and get them into stores, but on the other end, we had to try and find distributors for the extras, which are the extras that are the most important. So, we were in negotiations with Paramount to make those extras available quickly. But hey, we can never predict the future, so we'll just have to see what happens.


DM: Did you have any contact with Warner Brothers before releasing "The Mutilator" on DVD/BD?

We have a lot of fun from the very beginning of the process to the very end, but we can't stop there. It's a lot of fun to sit down and work on these things, and we're always looking for ways to add more and more to our catalog.


DM: I'm curious about your relationship with the Black Label: Do you have any exclusive material from any of your releases, or are you at the mercy of whoever releases it?


FS: It's a few different things. If we have a DVD from someone, the DVD is the property of whoever released it. Sometimes we do have some limited releases where we have something that's owned by a specific person. If we have a DVD that's a bit more exclusive, then we'll work with that person to make it available to us. We will also contact the people that we've worked with in the past and ask them to sign a release form so we know that they want us to have it.


DM: And what about the Black Label? Do you have any exclusive material from those releases?


FS: There's a few things. The original releases we've had for Black Label are always the same quality as our DVDs. We want to make sure that the core fans are getting what they want and that we're not doing something out of the ordinary. We are always looking for ways to make the Black Label releases better. We want to make sure that people who are new to the brand are getting what they want. We're always looking for ways to improve and add more features to our Black Label releases and that's something we can always do.


DM: What are the most important components in a good DVD or Blu-ray release?


FS: Obviously quality is paramount. We wouldn't want to release a DVD that was crappy. We want to make sure that people are getting the best quality for their money. Our DVD releases always have the best sound quality. We want to make sure that they have a good picture. We want to make sure that they're easy to read. We want to make sure that the overall picture is as good as it can be. We look at the packaging. It has to look great. We want to make sure that it's easy to set up and we want the packaging to be unique and different. We don't want our packaging to be the same.


DM: Are there any DVDs or Blu-rays that you have difficulty getting your hands on?


FS: For the most part, yes. We do have a couple of releases that we have trouble getting. There are a couple of DVDs that we can't get that we did try but just couldn't get. There's one DVD that we tried to get that's sure to be one of our best sellers, but we couldn't get it. It's one of those releases that we tried to get for years and years and ended up getting a few of them. But they were hard to get and we couldn't get them.


DM: Any particular releases that have been a struggle?


FS: The one that we're most proud of is the first one we did for the Black Label. That's the one that we're most proud of. It's the first release that we did and it had a lot of unique stuff. It was the first release that we had done for the Black Label that we were able to get right. We were able to get it right on every level. It was a really good release. That was a very

I'd say that a lot of what you see in these extras is stuff that we have done because it's good or interesting and it's not just stuff that we just threw in because it was there.


DM: Is it the feeling of "Wow, I could have done that" that you're after? Or is it more of a "Wow, we could have done that better"?


FS: I think the best way to describe what I'm after is the feeling of having a really great film that you've spent a lot of time and effort making. It gives you a great sense of accomplishment and pride that you've been able to create something that you know is really special. That's what is so great about Arrow. The guys are passionate about what they do and they work very hard to make each and every release special.

Others cost a bit more, like the Samsung Galaxy S 4. But some are just plain weird, like the 8GB iPhone 4. We've been playing around with the things that don't make sense for a new iPhone for a few weeks, and today we're ready to present the first round of our picks for the weirdest smartphones that you can buy.

From a completely different world

In a world where Apple's iPhone 4s has a 3.5-inch screen, the 8GB iPhone 4 looks like a relic from the past. The 4-inch iPhone is still the best-selling phone in America, and the iPhone 4 is the best-selling phone in the world — it's the only phone that has ever topped the 100 million unit mark. But even though it's a staple of our lives, the iPhone 4 is a relic from a world where phones were much bigger. Why would you buy a phone with an 8-megapixel camera when you can buy a phone with a slightly bigger camera that costs $100

 but passersby could not look in, the club had little competition for grandeur—except, perhaps, from the Union Club, which had plans to move in across the street.


[The entrance to the Metropolitan Club. Photo by James Nevius.]

As early as the 1880s, Some Union Club members had considered putting in an offer for the University Club's 54th Street corner lot, but the more conservative faction of the club had nixed the location as too far uptown. A decade later, with commercial enterprises surrounding their 21st Street home, the club finally decided to move, purchasing a large lot between 51st and 52nd streets on Fifth Avenue. Deciding to move was hard enough—then deciding what to build at the new location was even harder. A significant portion of the membership wanted to make a carbon copy of the club's 21st Street home, enlarging it to fit the club's new location. More progressive members commissioned a design from Cass Gilbert, whose splendid Custom House was then rising on Bowling Green. Unable to make a decision, the building committee called on Charles McKim to break the tie. McKim gave the nod to the rebuilt version of the old clubhouse—so the building committee, oddly, chose to move forward with
==================== COMPLETION 21 ====================
 McKim's design.

The new club, which opened in 1885, was a winner, attracting a few thousand of the club's members. As the club grew, so did its contributions to the community. The Metropolitan Club donated $1.5 million to the city's Public Library to build a library building, and the club also donated $1.5 million to build a New York Public Library of the Arts building. The club also lent money to the city's Metropolitan Museum, and donated $1 million to the Museum of the City of New York, and more.

Of the grandest buildings in the area, a majority were constructed by the Metropolitan Club. The Daughters of the American Revolution built the Colonnade Hotel, today the Manhattan Hotel. The African-American Club built the Harlem Hotel, and the New York Trust Building. The Union Club built the Metropolitan Club, and the Metropolitan Club built the Union Club.

The Union Club's crowning achievement came in the years after the building's first renovation. On the evening of May 5, 1903, the Metropolitan Club celebrated its centennial with a grand ball. The New York Times reported:

The elegant ball was attended by over 1,500 guests, among them the Hon. Henry Morgenthau, president of the National City Bank and the Times Company. The guests had the benefit of a magnificent dinner and their social life was prolonged over a series of dances, with all the songs of the day. On Tuesday evening the guest of honor was the Hon. Henry Morgenthau, son of President Roosevelt, who was honored by the evening's main attraction, the ball. The guest of honor was presented the "sparkler"—a large, flat, flat-bottomed glass, which was filled with champagne. The guests were then invited to place their hands inside the sparkler and drink the champagne. It was a wonderfully simple, elegant, and very elegant game.

The New York Times also reported that the ball was "a success," albeit "a success in the interest of the Metropolitan Club rather than that of the city."

When the Metropolitan Club was at its height, it was home to nearly one hundred different social organizations. The largest of these was the American Social Club, which had as many as eight hundred members. There were also the Interdepartmental Social Club, the Social Club of the City of New York, the Manhattan Club, the Metropolitan Club, the Bloomfield Club, the Harlem Club, the New York Public Library of the Arts, the Metropolitan Museum, and the New York Botanical Garden. The Metropolitan Club also sponsored the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers for the past seven decades. By the early twentieth century, the club had a mere five hundred members, but the institution grew further thereafter, becoming a major player in the social scene.

The Union Club, on the other hand, defined itself as a "man of the world," and its members included many of the city's wealthiest and most powerful. Its members included John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and John Jacob Astor. The club's size was also a problem. The Metropolitan Club faced opposition from the club's more conservative members who wanted to preserve the segregated nature of their organization. They felt that the club's cultural influence had grown too great, and that it should be more representative of the city.

To address these concerns, the Metropolitan Club began hiring all-white members. The club also began paying women for membership, which was not yet common. The club began hosting larger social functions, and, by the later part of the twentieth century, it was hosting parties for as many as two thousand people.

 the Custom House design, despite the fact that the club's new facility was only four floors higher.

The new building, completed in 1886, was the largest in the city. It was designed by architect Frederick Law Olmstead, who had designed the Union Club. It featured a brownstone façade, the centerpiece of which was a carved marble lobby. The upper floors were home to a number of offices, including the offices of the club's president and secretary, who oversaw the day-to-day operations of the club. The lower floors were the home for the club's men's locker rooms. Above the locker rooms was a grand staircase that led to the club's main floor, where the ballrooms were located. The building, with its imposing size, where one could feel the weight of the building, and its stature, was a significant improvement over the Union Club, which, like most of the city's sports clubs, had grown out of the days of teams with few dues-paying members. The Metropolitan Club was one of the few clubs with a membership that matched that of the Union Club, and its emergence as the city's premier club was a sign of New York's rise as a world city.

The building's grandeur inspired the club to move forward with a name change. The new name, "The Metropolitan Club," went into use on Oct. 3, 1886. The new name was meant to be a reflection of the city's rising prosperity; with the Metropolitan Club, the city's elite began to feel comfortable enough to venture out. The Metropolitan Club's name was a fitting summary of the club's rise: its high-end elegance and grandeur were there to welcome the rich and powerful to the city.

The Metropolitan Club was not only a well-remunerated sports club, it also served as a civic hub. The home of the New York City vs. Boston baseball team, the club hosted the United States' first baseball World Series on Oct. 27, 1886, and the Metropolitan Club also hosted the first-ever basketball World Series, which it won in 1886. The Metropolitan Club also hosted the first-ever polo match on Oct. 2, 1887. It also hosted the first-ever boxing match on Oct. 3, 1887, and the first-ever and second-ever hockey World Series on Nov. 7, 1887, and Nov. 8, 1887. On Nov. 2, 1887, the Metropolitan Club hosted the first-ever soccer World Series, which it won.

In its early years, the Metropolitan Club was the city's most important sports club. Its membership was committed and loyal, and the club flourished in its new location. In 1894, the Metropolitan Club was purchased for $2.5 million by William H. B. Whiting, a member of the Whiting family that had long been active in the construction and management of the Metropolitan Club. The Whiting family, owners of the New York Herald and New York World, had been among the club's most prominent members. The Whiting family's roots had been firmly planted in New York City for generations, and in 1894, the Whites had acquired the New York Herald, the New York World and the New York Sun, among other publications. After purchasing the club, Whiting named it the Metropolitan Club, and on Nov. 1, 1891, he purchased the New York Sun. Whiting's ownership of the club was so important to the club's continued success that it was named after him.

 but passersby could not look in, the club had little competition for grandeur—except, perhaps, from the Union Club, which had plans to move in across the street.

As early as the 1880s, Some Union Club members had considered putting in an offer for the University Club's 54th Street corner lot, but the more conservative faction of the club had nixed the location as too far uptown. A decade later, with commercial enterprises surrounding their 21st Street home, the club finally decided to move, purchasing a large lot between 51st and 52nd streets on Fifth Avenue. Deciding to move was hard enough—then deciding what to build at the new location was even harder. A significant portion of the membership wanted to make a carbon copy of the club's 21st Street home, enlarging it to fit the club's new location. More progressive members commissioned a design from Cass Gilbert, whose splendid Custom House was then rising on Bowling Green. Unable to make a decision, the building committee called on Charles McKim to break the tie. McKim gave the nod to the rebuilt version of the old clubhouse—so the building committee, oddly, chose to move forward with
==================== COMPLETION 23 ====================
 McKim's design.

In actuality, the McKim building was an oversized, overblown, and over-engineered version of the Custom House. The custom house of McKim's day was not only a beautiful building, but also a very practical one. Despite its 3,000 square feet, McKim's building was built in a very narrow footprint, and it was designed to be a fireproof, airtight building, built to go down easily during a fire. McKim's building was also a very economical building, with a very modest membership fee. The building's size was a conscious attempt to make it more practical for the club to expand, but the club had to make a decision as to how the building would be used.

The club's decision-makers knew that, like the Custom House, the new building would be a symbol of the new era of industrialism in New York. They went for a more direct, industrial look, with a large, modern steel warehouse-style building that was designed as a 19th century style factory, complete with spinning mill, sawmill, and an engine room.

The club had wanted to use the McKim building for a long time, and even built an 1873 model for the club to use, but the time came when the building required a major overhaul. The original McKim building was built in 1873, and it was still in good condition, but McKim's larger, modern warehouse-style building proved to be a better fit for the club's needs.

The McKim building was also a symbol of the transition to modernism in New York City. Since the 1880s, the city was undergoing a major transformation from the age of steam and iron to the age of steel and concrete. This new age was typified by the construction of the Metropolitan Club, built in the top-down style of the early 20th century, which brought a modern aesthetic to the top floors of the grand old Union Club. On the lower floors of the old Union club, the club had built a large, ornate, ornate ballroom, with a grandiose ceiling. The McKim building's modern warehouse-style building was meant to blend in with the modern, industrial style of the city.

The new building was not always a success. The club had a short-lived attempt to move into the building in 1914. The club re-located to the Custom House, which was still in use, because of space and cost concerns. This change of location ultimately cost the club $1,200,000, and it was not restored until the early 1940s.

The McKim building was not a success, but the club did find it useful as an office building for the club's fire department, and it was used for storage for the club's pianos. The building was eventually demolished in 1961 to make way for the construction of the Central Park West amusement park.

The McKim building is now the site of a very expensive lot which is currently empty. The building was a lucrative investment for the club, and it was a clever development, with a very clear purpose. The dream of the McKim building was that it would become a symbol of the new era of industrialism in the city. The club's ambitious plans were crushed by the city's own industrialism, but the building still stands, and it is a symbol of the new era of industrialism in New York City.<|endoftext|>Abstract

 the new one.

The new club house was a massive, open footprint that extended to the roof. The original Union Club had been built on a scale that was more grandiose than anything Tavernier had imagined, and McKim's scale was no different. The new building, by contrast, was a post-war marvel that was not only elegant, but also extremely efficient. When Richard et. al. arrived in New York, the club had just moved into its new home, and they were still figuring out how to run it. As one member recalls, "There was a considerable amount of confusion in the beginning, and we were all in a state of bewilderment."

As one member recalls, "There was a considerable amount of confusion in the beginning, and we were all in a state of bewilderment."

First, the club had to get a new elevator. The aging one was starting to fall apart. Then, to get access to the upper floors, club patrons had to use a door in the basement that required a key. The club was able to secure a key, but the key was only valid for the club's use.

As the club grew, so did the number of rooms. In the early years, the club bonded together with other clubs, but as it expanded, it also began to form new associations. The club had its own printing and publishing department, and it made a point of meeting with other clubs in the neighborhood. In the late 1880s, the club's first newspaper, The Union, was published. The club's association with other clubs gave it a large degree of social cachet, and it was a valued member of the community.

It was also a very exclusive club. The club had to earn its membership. The membership fee was a steep one (approximately $3,000 in today's money), but it was well worth it for the opportunity to be among the first to meet the new arrivals. The club had a waiting list of at least 500 people who wanted to become members. In the early years, the club was a hub of social activity, and it was difficult to get close to the action without price. A typical dinner would cost $500, a meeting at the club would cost $500, and dinner at any of the many fine restaurants that occupied the upper floors would run you another $500.

"I've spent a lot of money and I've made a lot of money in this club," says one member, "I've been a member of this club my whole life."

The club's membership list was filled with New Yorkers from all walks of life. It was an eclectic mix of businessmen, theatrical performers, artists, lawyers, businessmen, and even a former mayor. Many of the club's members were also members of the Union Club, which was not unusual at the time. The clubs were both social and business, and their members were often intimately connected. The clubs were also the most important meeting places in the city. The clubs were the most important meeting places in the city.

The clubs were also the most important meeting places in the city.

The Union Club's first president, Henry C. Higgins, was a member of the Union Club, so the two clubs were closely associated. Higgins was a shrewd businessman who was a founding member of the Manhattan Safety Society, a fundraising organization that was the

The people at EVGA have been extremely helpful and their customer service has been top notch. They were able to send me a replacement card (no questions asked) without any problems at all.


It seems like a good deal considering the price I paid for the card.


I'm glad EVGA is still around and that you guys are doing everything to support the card.


Good luck on your purchase!

 Regional Hospital and Heigh was taken to Anna Jaques Hospital in Newburyport, Mass., where she was released by Sunday.


Wells' widower, Tom Rogers, said police confiscated Hess' cell phone and car, as well as the bicycles of those who were hit.


He posted on Facebook notifying Wells' friends of the "tragic" news.


"The love of my life, my dear sweet Pam (Pamela Ann Wells), was killed this morning in a horrible accident ... Pam and I were married 19 years. She was a devoted mother to our 2 beautiful children, Alex, 17, and Elise, 16."


Wells was planning to ride 100 miles for the first time and had been working up toward it all summer, Rogers said. She, Bouchard and a third friend logged a 73-mile ride last week.


The three along with Bouchard's boss were struck after they had ridden about 15 miles, Rogers said.


"It's just a tragic event," he said.


Hess is due to appear at 8:30 a.m. on Oct. 23 in the 10th Circuit Court in Seabrook to face the summonses for speeding and driving

 without a license, according to court records.


Her attorney, William C. Stokes III, said her family is "extremely saddened" by the accident and has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for her funeral and other expenses.


She was driving a 2003 Honda Fit.


"It's just so sad," Stokes said. "She was a great, great woman."

The three friends were riding near St. George, where Wells had lived a few years before moving to Massachusetts, Stokes said.


He said he believes Hess was riding at least 50 mph in the 35 mph zone when she struck the group.


"It's just a horrible accident," he said.


Bouchard is a long-time cyclist who had recently been hired at a medical lab, Stokes said, and she had planned to ride this fall and winter before heading back to school this spring. She is a senior at Boston College.


Bouchard is a member of the Holy Cross cycling club, according to the chapter's Facebook page.


Rogers said Hess was riding with Bouchard, who serves as her coach, when the accident happened.


"They were all together, in the middle of the road," Rogers said. "They were all pretty much in the same vicinity. They were all about the same speed. They were just headed to the ride together."


The injured cyclist was not wearing a helmet, Stokes said.


"It's just a tragic accident," he said. "She was a wonderful person."

Antonio Guzzetti, who served as prime minister from 1980 to 1984, was taken to the hospital on Friday in Florence, where he was being kept in a medically induced coma.

His health had been slowly deteriorating for days, according to a statement released by his son-in-law, Mario Guzzetti.

"The illness of Antonio Guzzetti has brought us a great deal of joy," Mario Guzzetti said in the statement. "The mood is calm and is filled with love for his wife, for his family, and for the people of Italy."

Antonio Guzzetti, who was 69, was hospitalized on Thursday after suffering what his family said was a mild stroke.

Italian media reported that Guzzetti's health had been deteriorating for days, and he was being treated with antibiotics.

The former prime minister is not the first Italian politician to fall ill in recent years. Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who served from 1994 to 2011, fell ill in October 2011, shortly after conceding defeat to Prime Minister Mario Monti in the country's first-round parliamentary election. He was hospitalized for several days and was diagnosed with gout.

Berlusconi, who was dubbed "The Don" due to his famous political lifestyle, was eventually released from the hospital

When it comes to your health, more is not better. It is not better to be a diabetic or obese, but it is better to be an active one.

That should be obvious.

But it is true that we have made great strides in reducing the number of people who are overweight and obese. The obesity epidemic has declined by more than 20 percent since 1980, and today, only about 15 percent of U.S. adults are obese.

In that time, however, we have seen an increase in the number of people who are overweight and obese. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projects that the obesity rate will rise to a record 39.9 percent by 2020, and could reach 50 percent by 2050.

Even as Americans are becoming healthier, the number of people who are overweight and obese remains high.

Many factors are to blame for this obesity epidemic, including the decline in physical activity and the focus on calories, which is encouraging but far from conclusive.

Physical inactivity is a major problem. A 2012 study of Americans ages 20 to 74 by researchers at the University of California-Berkeley and the University of Colorado found that the percentage of non-active adults had increased from 57 percent in 1986 to 72 percent in 2010. In 1960, the percentage of active adults was 42 percent.

In addition, the study found that many people are not getting enough physical activity. Fifty-two percent of overweight and obese adults said they were physically inactive, versus only 36 percent of the healthy-weight adults.

Many early efforts to address this problem were not successful.

One of the most important was the Healthy People 2000 campaign, launched by the federal government in 2000, intended to promote physical activity and reduce obesity. Unfortunately, the campaign failed to persuade many Americans to exercise, and it lost momentum over time.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, in a report released in 2013, found that 133 million Americans did not meet the physical activity guidelines of at least 150 minutes a week.

Further, the report found that the percentage of Americans meeting the physical activity guidelines had increased by less than 2 percent each year since 2008.

Those results are not surprising given the fact that more than 60 percent of adults do not get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week.

The federal government has a role to play, of course. It should promote physical activity. But it should also be clear that the government's role in promoting physical activity is limited.

The federal government should not be in the business of telling people what to do with their own bodies.

Rather, the government should encourage individuals to make their own health decisions. That way, individuals can be responsible.

The government also should not pick winners and losers in the marketplace. This is particularly true since the government's own research has found that market forces are often the best way to help people achieve healthy lifestyles.

Unfortunately, the government seems to be ignoring this reality.

For example, in recent years, the federal government has promoted the use of high-fructose corn syrup in soft drinks—a sugar-sweetened product that has been linked with obesity and diabetes.

In 2012, the federal government gave $1 million to the American Beverage Association to lobby for its position that the sugar-sweetened beverage industry should be

Hess has been released from state custody on $5,000 bail, according to Gary Wejse, a state Department of Correction spokesman.


Bouchard, 43, of Boston, has been charged with one count of driving with a suspended license and one count of reckless operation of a motor vehicle.


Including Bouchard, Wells, Rogers, Bouchard's boss and the third friend, six people were injured.


Hess was on her way to Belgium to celebrate her birthday with her husband, Rogers said.


Bouchard was riding at about 70 mph with a speed limit of 45 mph when she apparently lost control and hit the other two, police said.


Rogers said the accident happened just before 3:30 a.m. when the group was headed from Boston to Cape Cod. He said the group was heading north from Cape Cod to get to an upcoming event with local bands.


"They were going to do a 100 mile ride," he said.


Rogers said he did not know how many people were in the group, but said the group included people from as far away as California and New Orleans.


"It was a very nice group of people," he said, adding that he had met Bouchard once or twice, but did not know her well.


"It's a terrible tragedy," he said.


Police said the group was riding in the left lane of Route 7.


"She was traveling at about 70 mph," Keefe said. "She lost control of the vehicle and struck two people on the side of the road."


Bouchard was pronounced dead at the scene. A man who was on the scene declined to give his name, saying he was not authorized to do so. A woman who was pronounced dead at the scene was identified by police as Bouchard's friend.


A second woman who was struck and received minor injuries was taken to Salem Hospital, Keefe said.

Rigby said the accident has left him emotionally drained.

This article will serve as a somewhat brief guide to the basics of a game engine that you may find useful in your own projects. We will be using Unity to build our game.

The Unity engine is a very flexible engine and has a wide variety of features that you can choose to use. However, it is not necessarily necessary, and I do not recommend using these features. Instead, we will focus on the most important features, and where they are most useful.

Classes

Unity comes with a system called classes. Classes are a simple way to organize your code. They are typically used to make a single thing easily accessible to multiple manner of code. In other words, a class is really just a generic way to group code that is reusable.

The main benefit of using classes is that it is very easy to replace and extend the functionality of a class. It is also a great way to organize your code.

Abaaoud was not found and is thought to have been in Turkey or Greece directing the pair by phone.

Police found four Kalashnikovs, four handguns, ammunition and explosives during the raid as well as a police radio and uniforms.

Two days later, officials in Athens announced they had captured Abaaoud but he had given them the slip.

Describing his return to Belgium for the beheading plot, he said he and his fellow fanatics faced a number of trials but 'were able to obtain weapons and set up a safe house while we planned to carry out operations'.

He added: 'After the raid on the safe house, they figured out that I had been with the brothers and that we had been planning operations together.

Witnesses also reported seeing one of the suspects fleeing in a car after the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January, while another was seen carrying a Kalashnikov in the Brussels area just under a month ago.

They all entered Syria from Greece in the last few weeks under the disguise of migrants last weekend.

Miami has already accounted for three starting quarterbacks over the past three seasons. First, they signed starter Matt Moore, who has been a disappointment after stumbling into the starting role. Then, they signed Chad Henne, who has had a rocky start to his career after taking over as the Dolphins starter in 2012. And then, last year, the Dolphins brought in Ryan Tannehill, who has been a disappointment since he took over as the team's starter from the retired Dan Marino.

The question for Miami is whether or not they continue with Tannehill or move on to a more seasoned veteran.

According to Dolphins' offensive coordinator Clyde Christensen, who was on SiriusXM NFL Radio on Thursday, the Dolphins are considering the former.

"I think we have a plan and I think there's a Plan B," Christensen said on the show. "We've been looking at a lot of different guys and we're still looking at a lot of different guys. But you have to go through that process. You have to go through that process and that process has not gotten any easier. So we're still looking at guys. We're still searching for players."

As mentioned previously, the Dolphins have already had to replace three starting quarterbacks since 2012. And in what is a trend for the Dolphins, they are not expected to make a move at quarterback this week.

As for the other option, Christensen said the team is still in the process of evaluating guys like Matt Moore, Chad Henne, and rookie Davis Webb.

"We're still looking at guys and we're still looking for players," Christensen said. "It's a process. It's a learning process and it's something that we're going to continue to do. There's no easy answer. I think we're just going to keep on evaluating and I think there's definitely going to be a couple of guys that we're going to look at, and we're going to keep on evaluating."

If the Dolphins are to go through this process, they will likely have to go through the draft.

"It's going to be a couple of guys that we're going to look at," Christensen said. "So it's not a decision that we're going to make this week."

So if the Dolphins don't make a move at quarterback this week, will they look to the draft to find a replacement?

"There's no question," Christensen said. "We want to be very aggressive in this draft and that's our philosophy, we want to be very aggressive in this draft."

It's unclear what the Dolphins would be looking for in a quarterback. However, when Christensen was asked if he'd rather have a player with

The two brothers were killed in a police raid in Saint-Denis in the Paris suburbs on Friday.

The killings in France are likely to intensify calls for more police to be stationed in Muslim areas and for tougher action against radical mosques and other extremist groups.

Two of the terrorists in the Paris attacks, including the French national Salah, were known to security services.

Abaaoud, who is believed to have been hiding in Belgium, met brothers Brahim and Salah in their 10th year of schooling in Molenbeek, a district of Brussels, the Belgian capital.

After working as delivery drivers, they left for Syria in September last year.

Belgium has become Europe's most dangerous country for jihadists, with two-thirds of those in prison for terrorism having links to the country, according to the latest European Observatory on Terrorism and Transnational Crime.

BELGIUM (AP) — A family court in Belgium ordered a father to pay child support for a 12-year-old girl, who was allegedly raped by her father, the court said Saturday.

The order comes after the girl, who is now 13, told her mother that she was being raped, said her lawyer, Charlotte Lahelma. She said the girl also told the public prosecutor that she had been raped.

Lahelma said the girl was raped because her father had a violent personality and the girl did not want to live with him.

 in Paris that killed 130 people on November 13.

Brahim Abdeslam was killed in the police raid in the Belgian capital on Friday, along with his brother Khalid, 26, and four accomplices.

Brahim Abdeslam was once a regular at the Bataclan music venue, where he sat at the back of the room and kept watch over the gunmen.

His brother Khalid was one of the men who killed 130 people in the Paris massacre, outside the Stade de France stadium.

Brahim, wearing the same black jacket he was seen wearing in the ISIS videos, was not in the Brussels raid but was later pictured in Syria with another terrorist, identified as Tawfik Hamzah.

Tawfik, who was shot dead in a gun battle with police in Paris, was identified as a member of the 'Jund al-Khilafa' militant group that has been linked to the Paris attacks.

It is thought he was killed in a gun battle with police in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis on Friday.

The younger Abdeslam was wounded in the raid but survived.

He was taken into police custody and a warrant issued for his arrest but he managed to flee Belgium.

The terror group released a video of four young men who they claim were part of a cell plotting to carry out an attack on the airport in Brussels, Belgium, on Friday November 14

The European Union has vowed to hunt down Abdeslam in an effort to bring him to justice.

But the Belgian authorities have so far made little progress in finding the younger brother.

It is understood that Abdeslam may have been in the country since January 2016, but a source close to the investigation said it was too early to say if he had been under surveillance.

Police had been on the lookout for the two boys after he was caught on CCTV in the Brussels neighbourhood of Molenbeek last October.

Investigators believe he was part of a cell that wanted to bomb the airport.

Belgian prosecutors have said they are now looking into the possibility that Salah Abdeslam, the brother of Brahim, was part of the cell that planned last Friday's attacks in Paris.

On Tuesday, the French government raised its terror threat status to the highest level, telling citizens to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities.

The government had initially said there was no immediate risk of an attack in France, but added that the threat was 'real and imminent'.

A spokesperson said: 'The government is monitoring the situation closely and the security services are working round the clock to react to this threat.'

The raid was carried out in the early hours of Tuesday morning on an apartment in the city's Molenbeek district.

A Dutch counter-terrorism prosecutor said the suspects were 'organised and well prepared'.

The prosecutor, Bert Van Overbeek, said the Paris attacks 'showed the possibility of a large-scale attack in Europe'.

He added: 'The family of the deceased suspects have been informed.'

All three were part of the Salafist movement of Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary, who was jailed last year for encouraging support for ISIS.

He has since returned to the UK and has been allowed to set up a mosque in Luton.

Choudary was pictured with Abaaoud on his Facebook page, where he wrote: 'I swear to Allah that I will never surrender to any other God but Allah.

'I will put my faith in Allah and my life in his service.'

The cleric was also filmed preaching at a mosque in London in April 2015.

 attained at the mean angle of perihelion with the planet. Thus, we consider the set of all possible orbits of the eKBO with the kind of libration angle in the plane of the eKBO and the longitudes of perihelion. This set is then constrained by the mean eKBO eccentricity for the planet. Note that in the case of HP, the eccentricity is fixed, but the eKBO eccentricity is the mean eccentricity of the planet. The coplanar orbits (e.g., 0.17 and 0.4) can be considered stable if the eccentricity is the same for both the eKBO and the planet. From this point of view the stable orbits are those with eccentricity e' = 0, i.e. asymptotic orbits of the eKBO with the same eccentricity as the eKBO. This picture is confirmed by the trace of the eKBO in the plane of the eKBO eccentricity that is also shown in Figure 2. In other words, this trace is directly proportional to the eKBO eccentricity. However, it is also clear that the stable orbits are not uniformly distributed. We note that the stable orbits with the same eccentricity as the eKBO are not unique, and in fact, some stable orbits are not coplanar to each other. For example, the orbits in the set of stable orbits of eccentricity 0.17 and 0.4 are not coplanar to each other. For the eKBO, the trace of the eKBO eccentricity is shown in Figure 3. The trace of the eKBO eccentricity is larger than 0. This is because the eKBO is not a perfect sphere. In the case of HP, for the same reason, the trace of the eKBO eccentricity is larger than 0 to the extent that the eKBO is not a perfect sphere. In fact, for the eKBO, the trace of the eKBO eccentricity is larger than 0 for the orbits with the kind of libration angle in the plane of the eKBO, and smaller than 0.5 for the orbits with the kind of libration angles in the plane of the eKBO and the eKBO eccentricity. We note that if we consider the coplanar orbits of the eKBO with the kind of libration angle in the plane of the eKBO, the trace of the eKBO eccentricity is very small. This is because the eKBO eccentricity is fixed. In particular, the eKBO eccentricity is largest in the case of the system HP, and the eKBO eccentricity is smallest in the case of the system HP + HP. The coplanar orbits of the eKBO are shown in Figure 3. The stable orbits with the kind of libration angle in the plane of the eKBO and the eKBO eccentricity are shown in Figure 4. Figure 3.

 obtained at a sensitivity of π/2 = 10.1. This is within the stability range of the so-called Libration-Reduction-Conjugate (LRCC) resonances [20]. It was shown that the latter can be extracted from observations of the perihelion precession of the planet and that the exact number of resonances depends on the planet's eccentricity. Using the LRCC of HD 189733 b, we find that the number of resonances is in the range of 10−8 to 10−10 and that the eKBO, in this case, has a resonance length of about 2.6 AU. This has a significance of up to about 2.5 AU [20]. In contrast, for HP, the LRCC of the eKBO provides a sensitivity of π/2 = 10.3. This is within the stability range of the so-called Libration-Reduction-Conjugate (LRCC) resonances [20]. However, in order to obtain libration with an acceptable level of accuracy, the eKBO must be slightly more eccentric than the planet. For a planet in its perihelion, this is usually expressed as a value for the eccentricity. Unfortunately, the eccentricity of the eKBO is not known because it has not been measured yet. For this reason, we restrict our investigation to the orbits of the eKBO of the planet. Figure 2 shows that for HP, there are two possible stable libration angles. The first one is 0.2. This is also the value of the resonance length l in the eKBO of HD 189733 b, where there are two such resonances. The second one is 0.5, which is the value of the resonance length l1 in the eKBO of HD 189733 b, where there are two such resonances. The red and gray lines in Figure 2 are the resonant orbits of HP, for a libration angle of 0.5 and l1, respectively. As can be seen from the figure, the stability of the libration angle is dramatically improved if the orbit of the planet is in the first (low) eccentricity. For a planet in the second (higher) eccentricity, the stability of the libration angle drastically decreases, since the resonance length l1 is about 1.5 times smaller than l. We can also illustrate that for a planet in the first (low) eccentricity, the libration angle is stable at a sensitivity of π/2 = 10.1. However, the characteristics of the libration angle are distorted by the eccentricity of the planet. For a planet in the higher eccentricity, the stability of the libration angle is much improved. In order to obtain stable libration with an acceptable level of accuracy, the eKBO must be slightly more eccentric than the planet. In this case, we have to use very high eccentricity orbits of the planet. In order to obtain stable libration, the eKBO must be very eccentric. For a planet in the higher eccentricity, the stability of the libration angle is much improved. However, the characteristics of the libration angle are distorted by the eccentricity of the planet. For a planet in the higher eccentricity, the stability of the libration angle is much improved.

 seen in possible eccentric orbits with eccentricity 0.17 and 0.4. Note that the sub-Earth orbits of HP in Figure 2 have the same first order semimajor axes as the eKBO, so the orbits are stable for the same reason. For the eKBO of Mercury, the first order semimajor axes are different, and therefore the orbits are unstable. In this case, we can observe the trace of a possible libration in the frame co-rotating with the mean angular velocity of Mercury, Figure 3(a). The differences in the first order semimajor axes between the eKBO and the eKBO of Mercury are due to the difference in the eccentricity e = 0 for Mercury and e = 0.17 for Sedna. The libration of a libration of 0.17 is stable, but the libration of 0.17 is unstable. Figure 3. Libration of the eKBO is stable in possible eccentric orbits with eccentricity 0.17.

3. Determination of the eKBO libration

We now investigate the libration of the eKBO in the frame co-rotating with the mean angular velocity of HP. The first order semimajor axes of the orbits of Venus and Mercury are c and d. The first order semimajor axes of the orbits of Mercury and Venus are 0.27 and 0.26, respectively, with similar first order semimajor axes as the eKBO of Mercury. We note that the orbits of Venus and Mercury are in unstable states, due to the difference in the first order semimajor axes. These two cases are the same for the eKBO of Mercury. We find that the first order semimajor axes of the eKBO of Mercury are 1.07, 0.45, 0.30 and 0.49 with the same first order semimajor axes as the eKBO of Mercury. The libration of the eKBO is stable in possible eccentric orbits with eccentricity 0.17. For Mercury the first order semimajor axes are 0.27, 0.26, 0.27 and 0.51, with the same first order semimajor axes as the eKBO of Mercury. Figure 4(a,b) shows the trace of the eKBO in the frame co-rotating with the mean angular velocity of HP.

We observe that at a distance of 0.5 AU, a libration is considered stable at a distance of 0.6 AU, i.e. at a distance of 1.3 times the semimajor axis of the planet. In the limit of strong tidal bulge, the stable libration is reached at a distance of 0.7 AU, i.e. at 2.4 times the semimajor axis of the planet. In the limit of strong tidal bulge and tidal eddy, the stable libration is reached at a distance of 0.8 AU, i.e. at 3.7 times the semimajor axis of the planet.

Iranian-Canadian journalist Mehrdad Khorrami and his Iranian-born colleague Mohsen Soghaei were among roughly 30 activists and defendants to be released from Tehran's Evin prison, their families said.

"I'm very much looking forward to finally seeing my family, and I'm so happy they are finally free," Khorrami told Reuters by telephone from the prison in Tehran.

"It's a big relief, but it does not mean I have forgiven my family, because they had the most terrible years of our lives," he said.

The Iranian judiciary had refused to let Khorrami and Soghaei leave prison until their trial was completed.

The Iranian judiciary "is trying to cover up its own crimes in order to save face," said Khorrami's wife, Manouchehr Mottaki.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards have vowed to continue their efforts to bring down the government of President Hassan Rouhani, who is promoting greater engagement with the West in the face of an international backlash over the disputed nuclear program.

A Supreme Leader's report last year criticized U.S. President Barack Obama for not doing enough to re-establish diplomatic relations with Iran and suggested he should have done more to stand up for Iranian rights in recent years.

"The Iranian authorities must stop harassing these two journalists and free them immediately," said Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa director Philip Luther, who was also freed.

Khorrami and Soghaei were among 30 activists and defendants sentenced to death in August 2009 for alleged espionage, a crime that carries the death penalty in Iran.

They had been held at Evin prison near Tehran, which was closed to the public and where they had been held in solitary confinement for many years.

The activists and defendants were freed from prison on Saturday afternoon as the Revolutionary Guards gave them buses to take them to their homes, their families said.

The Revolutionary Guards have denied holding the journalists hostage.

"I'm proud of my husband and the courage he showed in our most difficult days," said Mottaki, who was released along with Khorrami and Soghaei.

"My husband's release is a victory for Iranians everywhere who are committed to freedom of speech and peaceful protest."<|endoftext|>Since the advent of the first-generation 3DS, Nintendo has had a lot of problems with their handhelds.

About The 14th Factory

The 14th Factory is a monumental, multiple-media, socially engaged art and documentary experience conceived by the Hong Kong-based British artist Simon Birch. Taking over three acres of an empty industrial warehouse and lot on the outskirts of downtown Los Angeles, the location has been transformed into the factory where Birch and his 20 collaborators work and manufacture their art, creating an ever-changing immersive environment of 14 interlinked spaces comprised of video, installation, sculpture, paintings and performance.

In entering The 14th Factory, the visitor is transformed into a central player in a collaboratively fabricated adventure and motion picture that engages and unfolds, uniting individuals to the creative process and to each other. The experience challenges the current political climate by celebrating creative diversity, unity and the act of overcoming obstacles and challenges as a global society.

As part of the experience, the viewer's journey might be filmed for documentary and promotional purposes. Upon completion of its film, The 14th Factory intends to temporarily open the newly created space to the public. This future exhibition is dependent on The 14th Factory obtaining certain permits from the City of Los Angeles. More details to follow.

Title text: The Internet has been up and down for me, but it's been good and stable.

Explanation [ edit ]

This comic shows a screen of the web browser which Cueball is using, and which is presumably the browser used by Cueball, who is reading a news article about the ongoing efforts of the War on Drugs against drugs which are illegal in the United States and are illegal in countries which are hostile to the United States.

The title text mentions that the Internet is down in some areas of the world, and can be unstable, especially if there is a break in the mesh. The last quote seems to be a reference to the fact that there have been some developments in the War on Drugs' anti-drug efforts (the War on Drugs being the USA's effort against drugs), although these developments have had some negative consequences, including the arrests of many people for drug possession, and the resulting rise of the drug cartels.

Diversity and Engagement

The 14th Factory is a collective effort. The project is space-specific and works at different scales. From the micro level of individual artists making their own work to the macro level of a whole multi-media installation, the project is a platform for social engagement and collaboration.

The 14th Factory is also diverse in its membership. The artists range from university graduates and activists to artists from the Hong Kong-based international community. The 14th Factory is a local event that reflects the multicultural community of Los Angeles.

The exhibition comes at a time when the art and art-making landscape is showing signs of fragmentation. In an increasingly digital environment, artists and curators need to be able to collaborate effectively and find new ways to share their work and ideas. This exhibition is one of several projects that are addressing these challenges.

The 14th Factory is a social investment in the future of art and culture. The project will encourage engagement with the larger social and cultural fabric of our city through the creation of a space for social engagement and collaboration.

The two sides mutually agreed to part ways and both sides agreed to go their separate ways. — Eric DeCosta (@EDeCosta) March 9, 2015

Hampton, who was signed by the Ravens as a free agent in March, arrived in Baltimore as a "big man" off the street. He was the third-leading tackler in the NFL and was a 2012 first-round pick of the New York Giants.

He had an up-and-down career at the University of Minnesota. He was a second-team All-Big Ten pick in 2011 but missed all of 2012 due to injury. He had a strong preseason in 2013 and saw his role on the defensive line increase. This year, he started nine games.

Hampton started all three games for the Vikings in their Super Bowl XLVI loss to the New England Patriots. He had a sack, three tackles for loss, a forced fumble and a pass defensed in those three games. He finished the season with 13 tackles, three tackles for loss, two sacks and a pass defensed.

Hampton was in his ninth NFL season.

Nimr's brother, Mohammed, said he had hoped that "wisdom and a political solution" would prevail to spare the cleric's life.

He warned that his execution could trigger "negative reactions" inside and outside Saudi Arabia.

The governments of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, however, voiced support for Saudi Arabia, saying the executions were necessary to confront extremism.

Executions have soared in the country since King Salman ascended the throne a year ago, with 153 people put to death in 2015, nearly twice as many as in 2014.

Rights groups have repeatedly raised concern about the fairness of trials in Saudi Arabia, where murder, drug trafficking, armed robbery, rape and apostasy are all punishable by death.

Nimr was arrested in 2012, three years after calling for Eastern Province's Shiite-populated Qatif and Al-Ihsaa governorates to be separated from Saudi Arabia and united with Bahrain.

 minister Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, who was executed by Saudi authorities in January 2015 after a huge public outcry.

He was the first of six Shia clerics executed in Saudi Arabia since the start of 2015.

In October, Nimr and three other prominent Shia clerics were among a group of 20 people sentenced to death for breaking allegiance with the kingdom in January.

They were among five men who were killed in a mass execution in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province in January 2015.

Nimr had defended those who had been sentenced to death, saying they were sentenced for "spreading corruption on earth".

Freed cleric

Nimr was first arrested in 2012 when he was a leading cleric in Qatif, where he was considered a liberal voice.

The cleric's arrest came as Saudi Arabia was cracking down on dissent, with the kingdom's anti-terrorism campaign known as "Purge" under way.

Qatif residents say Saudi security forces arrested Nimr and jailed him for eight months before releasing him after he complained to the authorities about their mistreatment.

He was detained again in 2013 for "inciting sectarian strife" and was released in June 2014 after a court rejected a request by the government to keep him in jail.

In March this year, Nimr went on hunger strike out of protest at what he said was a lack of protection from the authorities.

He later said he had refused the offer of food and water but had not abandoned his protest.

The preacher was arrested in May after two men were killed in a shooting in his home district of al-Qatif, sparking protests by residents demanding his release.

Al-Qatif was the scene of sectarian clashes in 2011 between Sunni Saudis and the country's Shia population, which was suffering from poor health conditions.

The country has been gripped by unrest since 2011, when Saudi Arabia led an Arab coalition in air strikes in neighboring Yemen against a rebel movement that came to power in the country's Arab Spring uprising.

Trials in Saudi Arabia are shrouded in secrecy and no information has been released about how many people are on death row.<|endoftext|>By: Dave O'Malley

The first and second-quarter scores only tell a portion of the story as to how the Denver Broncos defense performed in this week's game against the Seattle Seahawks. The Broncos were incredibly good against the Seahawks offense this past week and there were several plays that I will write about that I felt were "disappointing" in terms of the defensive effort.

Here are some of the plays that I was able to pick out during this game that I felt were poor from the defense.

Here is a third down play from the first quarter where the Seahawks come out in a single-high set with the tight end in the backfield, their offensive line is in a "5" spread formation and the running back is aligned in a wide-9 alignment.

The Seahawks have a good run blocking offensive line, but the running back has no one to block his man, so he is able to pick up about 15 yards of space and gain the first down.

This play came late in the third quarter after the Seahawks were down by one and the Broncos were in a 3-4 alignment. The Broncos have moved their defensive line from their five-man front to a three-man front and are in a traditional 4-3 look.

The Seahawks' tight end is running a seam route and the Broncos are in their four-deep zone defense. The tight end is running a perfect route and he is wide open for a touchdown.

On this play, the Broncos have a five-man front with six defenders in

(Reporting by Saud al-Hamad; Editing by Angus MacSwan)<|endoftext|>The "Star Wars" franchise has a rich history, but if you're not sure of its history, then you're not alone. That's why I decided to find out from the experts who have been there before.

The one thing that's clear is that "Star Wars" was a massive hit. The film was based on the success of the first "Star Wars" film, and the second film, "Return of the Jedi," was a huge hit too, earning $819 million dollars in the United States alone. But the most critically acclaimed film was "Episode IV: A New Hope," which was based on George Lucas's original story. The film was made in 1977 and won the special-effects and special-effects director Oscars in 1977.

The "Star Wars" franchise has been a big hit in a lot of countries. In the United States, the film was a huge success, earning $5.9 billion dollars in box office receipts, outgrossing the record-breaking "Harry Potter" trilogy. In the United Kingdom, the film was released in 1977 and earned $2.4 billion dollars in box office receipts, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time in the United Kingdom.

The "Star Wars" films have also been very popular in Japan, where the franchise has been able to generate $5 billion dollars in box office receipts.

The true "star" of the "Star Wars" franchise is the original "Star Wars" film, released in 1977. The second, "The Empire Strikes Back," was released in 1980 and won the film-making Oscar for best picture.

And while the films have been very popular, they have also been very divisive. The first "Star Wars" films were criticized for the dark and gritty tone of the films, especially the third film, "Return of the Jedi," which is considered to be one of the worst films in "Star Wars" history. The third film also featured the first appearance of the iconic Darth Vader.

The third film was also criticized for its "Star Wars"-like mythology.

The "Star Wars" franchise has also been criticized for the later films, "The Empire Strikes Back" and "The Return of the Jedi," which were more personal in nature and focused on the heroes, Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.

The fourth film was also criticized for its dark and gritty tone.

The most recent "Star Wars" film, "The Force Awakens," was released in 2015, and it is considered to be one of the best "Star Wars" films of all time.

The most popular "Star Wars" film of all time is the original, "Star Wars," which is considered to be the best film in "Star Wars" history and the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States.

The following list tracks "Star Wars" film franchises in order of gross box office receipts. The rankings are based on the number of films earned worldwide, not the total number of films in the franchise.

1. "Star Wars" (1977)

2. "Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope" (1977)

3. "Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back" (1980)

4. "Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi" (1983)

 minister Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a leading Shi'ite cleric, who was killed in a wave of unrest in 2011.

The office of Bahrain's ruler, Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, said Nimr's execution "is in accordance with the law and the rights of the deceased."

The UAE embassy in Riyadh denied that it had been informed of Nimr's death.

"The UAE welcomes all executions in accordance with the law. The UAE does not support any form of terrorism," it said.

Saudi Arabia's top cleric, Grand Mufti Abdulaziz Al al-Sheikh, said the cleric's execution was a "severe blow to the morale of Saudi youth and to the international public opinion."

The United States, which has for decades pressed Riyadh to do more to curb Shi'ite unrest in the kingdom, said the executions were "deeply troubling" and urged Saudi Arabia to hold an independent inquiry into Nimr's case.

Human rights groups condemned Nimr's death, saying he was a peaceful activist who was a victim of the Saudi government's crackdown on dissenters.

"The Saudis have sent an unmistakable signal that anyone who dares to challenge the authorities' abusive practices will face the same fate," Sophie Richardson, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Amnesty International, said in a statement.

Nimr's son, Talal al-Nimr, also said his father had been arrested by the authorities in 2012. He said he was released after some 30 days.

"My father was in the wrong place at the wrong time," Talal al-Nimr told Reuters.

"I believe his execution message has reached every single child in Saudi Arabia and the world, regardless of their religious faith or sect."

Robert Robert Wilson, 33, was sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court after he pleaded guilty to killing John O'Brien in the early hours of December 23 last year.

The father-of-three, from Anfield, was out celebrating his birthday at a Liverpool pub when he was attacked by Wilson, who had been drinking.

Wilson, of St Helens Avenue, Liverpool, had been off duty at the time of the killing.

He beat the father-of-three with a metal bar and then pulled the trigger of his gun.

Family of victim John O'Brien

The jury heard how O'Brien was left with a fractured skull, a fractured eye socket, a broken leg and a brain haemorrhage, and died in hospital in the early hours.

Wilson had already admitted manslaughter, but had denied murder.

He is the second officer to be jailed for killing a family member on Merseyside this year.

Jurors heard of the case after Wilson was given a 28-week sentence.

Wilson had admitted to officers that he had been drinking but denied being drunk.

The trial heard he had been at the pub with a female friend, who told the jury he produced a revolver, aimed it at Mr O'Brien and said "give it to me, I will shoot him".

He also said O'Brien was a "cheat" and a "wanker".

His friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, later told police that Wilson had been violent with Ms Harwood, who was with her husband at the time

That's what happened to Renee Zellweger when she was approached by producers and screenwriters for a movie about her life.

The Oscar-nominated actress and longtime Disney star got the idea while sitting around a table at a Los Angeles restaurant back in May 2012. The group was talking about the power of the Internet and the ways in which it has empowered people.

"It was a conversation about how technology is changing the world," she told TODAY.com. "Imagine if you could make a movie about the way people communicate today, and how that changes your life. That's how I saw it."

Zellweger said she quickly came to the conclusion that everybody has connections across continents, and that she wanted to tell a story that would have an impact on the world.

"It was like, 'Wow, why don't we make a movie about you and your life?' " she said. "We can make a movie about the different roles you play in the world, the roles you play in your family, the roles you play in your business. We can all be actors in that movie."

Zellweger and her producer, Naomi Scott, wrote the script, which was picked up by The Weinstein Company and will be released in theaters next year.

And that's when the movie actually started.

The two producers traveled around the country to meet with people who were important to Zellweger's life, to find out how they felt about her.

"We met with people in all walks of life that were a part of the lives of Renee," Scott said. "And we met with people who were disconnected and didn't know her as a person, and they loved her. We met with people who didn't know her at all, and we loved the beauty in their lives."

The movie will feature the voices of actors such as Steve Carell, Brandon Micheal Hall, Deen Castronovo, and Michael Cera, as well as music from artists including Owl City, Bee Gees, and Muse.

"For the story that we're telling, we had to include people from all walks of life," Scott said. "We wanted the movie to be about the heroes and bad guys and people who are in the middle, and to show the layers that make Renee Zellweger a beautiful person."

The movie will also have a whole new cast, too: It will include a female lead, and Scott said she's excited to have a female director.

"We're excited to bring in a female director, and [it's] a little bit of a first in the industry," Scott said.

The producers also plan to explore the world of the Internet and the role that technology plays in personal and professional life.

"We're really looking at what happens when people are connected," Scott said. "We're looking at how they communicate, and how they share their ideas and their ideas with the world. What happens when we use technology in a positive way? What are the things that are bad about technology? What are the things that are good about it? We're looking at it from every angle, and the movie is really about the Internet and how it changes people's lives

The abundance of the bacterial taxa in DWW was characterized by their relative abundance in the sequencing libraries. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was relatively high, with a relative abundance of $858$% in the 16S rRNA gene amplicon library. However, there was a significant difference between the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria, with a relative abundance of $33.6$% and $1.5$% in the 16S rRNA gene amplicon and 16S rRNA gene, respectively. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was highly variable between the two amplicons, with the largest relative abundance of $156.2$ in the 16S rRNA gene amplicon library and $141.6$ in the 16S rRNA gene, respectively. The relative abundance of Cyanobacteria was relatively low, with a relative abundance of $2.0$% in the 16S rRNA gene amplicon library. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was relatively low, with a relative abundance of $0.6$% in the 16S rRNA gene amplicon library. The relative abundance of Hyphalobacterium, which was not found in the 16S rRNA gene amplicon library, was found in the 16S rRNA gene amplicon and 16S rRNA gene, respectively.

The bacterial communities contained different numbers of bacterial sequences, with the 16S rRNA amplicon library containing the highest number of sequences at $115.2$ and the 16S rRNA gene amplicon containing the highest number of sequences at $15.7$. However, the smallest relative abundance of sequences in the 16S rRNA gene amplicon library was $0.4$ compared to $0.8$ in the 16S rRNA gene amplicon library.

The relative abundance of the bacterial communities in the DWW microbiome was highly variable between the two amplicon libraries. This was particularly evident in the amplicon libraries from the DWW microbiome, where the numbers of sequences varied from $1.8$ to $1.8$ and $0.4$ to $1.8$.

The relative abundance of the bacterial taxa in the DWW microbiome was also determined by their relative abundance in the 16S rRNA gene amplicon library. In the amplicon library from the DWW microbiome, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was relatively high, with a relative abundance of $858$% in the 16S rRNA gene amplicon library (Table 3).

The mean age of the DWW was 15.7 ± 2.3 years and the mean age of the environmental samples was 17.7 ± 3.7 years (Table 3). This difference in age mainly relates to the difference in the age of the DWW and environmental samples.

The fecal microbiota of the DWW was characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The sequences of the DWW microbiome were compared to the reference human gut microbial community (HMP) sequence database. The community structure of the DWW microbiome was comparable with the HMP, which was obtained from the same individuals (Figure 3). The findings suggest that both the DWW and environment are characterized by an extensive diversity of gut microbial communities.

Figure 3: Comparison between DWW and HMP compared to the reference human gut microbial community. The community structure from the DWW and the reference human gut microbial community (HMP) were compared using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The comparison revealed that the DWW and HMP were characterized by a similar diversity of gut microbial communities. The HMP contains sequences from >1000 bacterial species (these sequences were grouped into 4 phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria). The proportions and abundances of each phyla were similarly represented in the DWW and C57BL/6J mice. Full size image

Several bacterial taxa were isolated from the DWW. The most abundant species in the DWW were Bacteroides, which was found in the community at significantly higher levels than the other taxa (Figure 4). The most abundant species belonging to the Bacteroides phylum were B. longum CPM2 and B. longum CPM3 (Figures 4A and 4B). Bacteroides vaginalis was the most abundant species in the DWW environment and B. longum CPM2 and B. longum CPM3 were the most abundant species in the DWW (Figures 4B and 4C). The bacterial taxa found in the DWW environment were also enriched in the genus Akkermansia. Akkermansia spp. are diverse members of the genus Akkermansia that are found in many environments around the world. Akkermansia spp. have been used as model organisms for studying the role of the gut microbiome in intestinal homeostasis (25).

 reads as unclassified roots. A total of 13,040 reads could not be identified and remained as unclassified bacteria. An additional 23,000 sequences (21%, <300 bp) were short in length and were removed before further analysis. Employing deep sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, we estimated the bacterial diversity of the DWW microbiome.

The total DWW bacterial community contained 24 phyla, unclassified bacteria, and Archaea from the sequencing data. Sequences which showed less than 80% homology to the unclassified bacteria constituted 26% of the microbial community. The obtained taxonomy data demonstrates that DWW is remarkably biodiverse; covering a broad spectrum of known and unknown bacterial taxa (Table 3). The bacterial community consisted of Proteobacteria (21 to 98%), unclassified Bacteria (0.4 to 96%), Firmicutes (0.1 to 74%), Cyanobacteria (0.02 to 15%), Bacteroidetes (0.2 to 12%), Chloroflexi (0.3 to 7%), Fusobacteria (0.2 to 6%), Actinobacteria (0.2 to 3%), Synergistetes (0.04 to 2%) and Acidob

acteria (0.02 to 1%).

The richness of the DWW bacterial community was higher than that of the DWW community of a human gut, but lower than that of the gut microbiome of an obese human (Table 3). This suggests that the DWW microbiome is relatively more diverse than the same community of the human gut.

The diversity of the DWW microbial community also differed among the two species of human samples. The majority of the DWW bacterial community was found in the gut of an obese individual, whereas the DWW microbiome of a lean individual was dominated by Firmicutes.

We explored the composition of the microbiome of the DWW microbiome by using FISH, which allowed us to identify the phylogenetic relationship among the different bacterial taxa. We used the cluster analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences as a method to determine the phylogeny of the DWW microbiome. The results indicated that the DWW microbiome was comprised of a diverse set of bacterial phyla, with the greatest diversity found in the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla, with the smallest diversity in the Cyanobacteria (Fig. 4).

Figure 4: DWW bacterial community in the gut of an obese individual and a lean individual. The maximum likelihood tree was constructed with the maximum likelihood method in R, using data from the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data ( Table 3 ) and a tree based phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences ( Fig. 3 ). A total of 1,839,844 sequences were aligned and analyzed. The alignment of the 16S rRNA gene sequences was done using the program MAFFT (version 4.12.0, http://www.mbio.nl/), and the phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences was done using MEGA version 2.1.0 ( http://www.plosm.org/m Josh Alex that was used to create the tree. Based on the alignment, the topology of the phylogenetic tree was determined. The tree was then demarcated by a node length (L) of 10,000. The analysis of the raw data revealed that the topology of the tree was consistent with a single lineage of Proteobacteria (L = 0.13), a gut microbiota dominated by a Firmicutes (L = 0.10), and a Cyanobacteria (L = 0.06).

Furthermore, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the DWW microbiome. The results of this phylogenetic analysis indicated a single lineage of Proteobacteria (L = 0.13), a gut microbiota dominated by a Firmicutes (L = 0.10) and a Cyanobacteria (L = 0.06).

We also embarked on a study to assess the fecal microbial composition of the DWW microbiome. To establish the fecal microbiota composition of the DWW microbiome, we used Affymetrix GeneChip® (http://www.affymetrix.com) to amplify 16S rRNA gene sequences from fecal samples from an obese individual, a lean individual, and a human healthy control. The results of the fecal microbiome analysis showed that the fecal microbiome of the DWW group was dominated by Firmicutes (95%) and Bacteroidetes (5%) (Fig. 5).

acteria (0.04 to 2%). Distinct bacterial lineages were detected by deep sequencing (Table 3) and include the Lactobacillus (3 to 34%), Vibrio (2 to 17%), Proteobacteria (1 to 28%), Actinobacteria (0.1 to 15%), Cyanobacteria (0.2 to 10%) and Acidobacteria (0.1 to 8%).

The total bacterial community contained a large number of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. Approximately 10% of the 16S rRNA sequences contained one or more ssDNA and/or mRNA molecules. Other sequences contained both ssDNA and mRNA molecules, which usually occurred at high frequencies in woody and rocky substrates. Only a small number of sequences (n = 16) contained an ssDNA and/or mRNA that could be recovered by the 454 pyrosequencing technology.

The DWW microbial community also contained high numbers of the bacterial polysaccharide cellulose biosynthesis and cellulose metabolism genes, and a number of genes encoding cellulolytic enzymes. In the community, polysaccharide feeding was prevalent in fungi and bacteria and was enriched in the soil (Table 3).

The total bacterial community contained a large number of genes encoding flagellar proteins (flagellins, flagellins-like proteins and flagellar-like proteins). The rate of flagellar production was estimated based on the number of flagellar-like proteins (flagellins, flagellins-like proteins and flagellar-like proteins) and flagellar-like proteins which could be recovered from the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. The average number of flagellar proteins per gram of soil was estimated to be approximately 1.1 per gram of soil.

The total DWW microbial community contained a large number of genes encoding proteins involved in the process of degradation of polysaccharide molecules. The most abundant degradation proteins were flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO) and the most abundant degradation enzymes were laccase and catalase (Table 3). The maximum number of FMO and laccase genes was estimated from the total DWW microbial community. The average number of total DWW polysaccharide degradation enzymes per gram of soil was estimated to be approximately 1.8 per gram of soil.

The total DWW microbial community contained a high number (n = 3) of genes encoding polysaccharide degradation enzymes. The polysaccharide degradation enzymes were found to be most abundant in the soil, and the highest abundance of polysaccharide degradation enzymes were detected in the woody and rocky substrates (Table 3).

The total DWW microbial community contained a high number (n = 3) of genes encoding enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of polysaccharide molecules. The most abundant hydrolysis enzymes were laccase and catalase. The average abundance of polysaccharide hydrolysis enzymes per gram of soil was estimated to be approximately 1.8 per gram of soil.

The total DWW microbial community contained a high number (n = 3) of genes encoding enzymes involved in the degradation of polysaccharide compounds. The most abundant degradation enzymes were laccase and catalase. The average abundance of polysaccharide degradation enzymes per gram of soil was estimated to be approximately 1.8 per gram of soil.

The total DWW microbial community contained a high number (n = 3) of genes encoding enzymes involved in the production of polysaccharide compounds. The most abundant degradation enzymes were laccase

The system would be modeled after the U.S.-European Union Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which was established in 2002 and is used to share information about cyber threats and vulnerabilities. In 2010, the Obama administration made it mandatory for all federal agencies to put in place a cybersecurity plan.

"Essentially, this is a new, entirely voluntary network that would allow for the sharing of information on vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks and would be modeled after the EU system," the Times reported.

The White House has not announced any plans to establish such a network, but said in a statement earlier this year that the cyber threat was a "top national security priority." The Times reported that a senior administration official said the system may be aimed at helping foreign governments better protect their own networks, so that they can better protect the U.S.

"Under this proposal, the United States would provide assistance on a voluntary basis to support the organization of a global information sharing and analysis center, which would generate, maintain, and distribute cyber threat indicators and defensive measures from the private sector and other governments," the Times reported.

"The United States has been reluctant to get involved in what it considers a more traditional international approach to cyber policy," the Times reported. "The effort toward a global cybersecurity network has been led by the National Security Agency."

The report comes as the Obama administration is under fire for its response to the large-scale hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment last month. The White House is facing accusations that it has not been aggressive enough in trying to stop the hack, which led to the theft of hundreds of thousands of private emails and sensitive documents from Sony.

The White House's response has been criticized for being too passive, and the Times report came as a new report said that the White House is planning to release 20,000 classified documents related to the Sony hack on Friday. The new documents reportedly include details about the conversation between the U.S. secretary of state and the head of Sony Pictures Entertainment on the night of the attack.<|endoftext|>The Jacksonville Jaguars have agreed to terms with former Green Bay Packers tight end Jermichael Finley on a one-year deal, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Finley, 30, spent the first nine years of his career with the Packers, going to eight Pro Bowls during his career. Finley was originally drafted in the fourth round of the 2003 NFL Draft in the NFL Supplemental Draft and has since played for the Broncos, Texans, Giants, Panthers and Packers.

Finley has played in 59 career NFL games, with 12 catches for 217 yards and two touchdowns.<|endoftext|>In contrast to the three-course meal, the "Breakfast on the Run" is a breakfast from a suitcase. It's an opportunity to sample as much as you can before you depart.

 is unprecedented. Have we ever seen it done in any free country? Was it ever so in the mother country? It never was so in any well-regulated country. It is a government of force, and the genius of despotism expressly. It is not proved that this power is necessary, and if it be unnecessary, shall we give it up?

Mr. MADISON. Mr. Chairman, I will endeavor to follow the rule of the house, but must pay due attention to the observations which fell from the gentleman. I should conclude, from abstracted reasoning, that they were ill founded I should think that, if there were any object which the general government ought to command, it would be the direction of the national forces. And as the force which lies in militia is most safe, the direction of that part ought to be {413} submitted to, in order to render another force unnecessary. The power objected to is necessary, because it is to be employed for national purposes. It is necessary to be given to every government. This is not opinion, but fact. The highest authority may be given, that the want of such authority in the government protracted the late war, and prolonged its calamities.

He says that one ground of complaint,
==================== COMPLETION 65 ====================
 is that the power is too extensive. The fact is, that the power is not too extensive. It is sufficient to give the direction of the militia, and to render it unnecessary to call out the regular troops. If it had been assumed that the power was too extensive, it could, I believe, have been taken out of the hands of the government. It would have been left in the hands of the people, who have a right to alter it and to amend it.

Mr. MELVILLE. Mr. Chairman, I am as much in favor of this power as any gentleman. The gentleman has not a single word to say in answer to the arguments he has advanced. He has made no effort to draw any distinction between this power and that which is delegated to the general government. He has not the least idea that the latter is a more extensive one. He is averse to giving this power to the government, because it is too extensive. He will not say that the power is too extensive, because it is in the hands of the general government. He is afraid that it will be taken from the hands of the people. I am not afraid that it will be taken from the people, because it is in the hands of the government. He says that the power is unnecessary. That is quite a contradiction. That power is necessary to the government. What is the government without that power? The government is that which controls the militia, which provides for their support, and sends them in to execute the laws. If this power be not given to the government, it is necessary. If I am to say, that the government may be established without this power, I am no friend to the government, and the gentlemen who are opposed to it, are my enemies. The power is necessary. It is not necessary that the government be established. It is necessary that the power should be given to the government.

Mr. WILSON. Mr. Chairman, I have a doubt whether it will be proper for the gentleman to proceed further. He has very little to say about the proposition itself, and is evidently unwilling to examine the arguments which are urged against it. I ask him whether he will give any reasons in favor of the power. He has nothing to say about it. He has nothing to say about the powers of the government. If he has any reason for saying that it is necessary, why does he not say it? Why does he not make his way to all the reasons which have been urged against it? He has nothing to say about the powers of the government. He has said nothing about the powers of the general government, and the nature and extent of the powers of the federal government. He has said nothing about the powers of the states. He has said nothing about the states perhaps as much as he has about the powers of the general government. He has said nothing about the powers of the state governments. He has said nothing about the powers of the people. He has said nothing about the authority of the people. He has said nothing about the power of the individual. He has said nothing about the rights of individuals. He has said nothing about the rights of the people as a whole. He has said nothing about the rights of the people generally. He has said nothing about the rights of the individual. He has said nothing about the rights of individuals as a whole.

I do not see what he has to say in regard to the powers of the individual, and the rights of the individual as a whole. Suppose the powers of the individual to be few, what has he to say about the rights of individuals? He has no reason to say that there are more rights to be asserted than those which are asserted.

==================== COMPLETION 66 ====================
 the greatest, is, that the power is not given to the government. However, I have no objection to a power of calling out the militia. This has been done, as far as I know, in every state of the Union, by the constitutions of every state. There are no objections because the power is given to the general government, if the power is not given to the states. [A motion was made in the affirmative, which was seconded.] It is a question then, whether the power be given to the general government or to the states? The powers of the general government, however, are so extensive, and the objects of government so numerous, that it ought to be given to the general government. The power of calling out the militia is in the hands of the legislature. The powers of the legislature, as far as concerns war and peace, are in the hands of the general government. [A motion was made in the affirmative, which was seconded.] The powers of the general government are such as would be necessary to the execution of the general laws, and those of the state governments are so numerous, that they could not possibly be executed. It is not in the power of the general government to make war or peace. It is in the power of the general government to regulate commerce, and to provide for the common defence. The powers of the general government are so extensive that they could not possibly be executed. It is in the power of the general government to make a treaty with a foreign power, and to cede to it the territory of a state. It is not in the power of the general government to make a treaty with a foreign power, and to cede to it territory of a state. It is in the power of the general government to make a treaty with a foreign power, and to cede to it territory of a state.

I say, then, that the powers in the general government are so numerous that they could not possibly be executed. It is in the power of the general government to make a treaty with a foreign power, and to cede to it territory of a state.

He says that one ground of complaint,
==================== COMPLETION 67 ====================
 and one of the causes of the late confederation, was the want of a standing army. It is true that the first of these requisites was not provided for. The second was not provided for till after the rebellion. But the first and second were not a reason why the legislature should not have provided for them. The first and second are not requisites. The first is a necessary and proper condition; the second is a reasonable one. The last is a gratuitous requisition, and we have no right to make it. It is the object of this convention, not of this house, to regulate the rights of the people. It is a general power, and, as it is not given to the general government, it can never be given. The power of raising and regulating armies is a part of our government. This power has been the object of the late confederation. It was in the former, and it is in the latter. It was in the former, and, therefore, the power of raising and regulating armies was in it in both. This power cannot be given by the general government. The general government can no more regulate the military force than it can regulate the general government itself. It is incapable of regulating the military force. It is a part of its business, and the power of raising and regulating armies is a part of that business. It is a part of any government's business to raise and regulate armies. The constitution of this country does not authorize Congress to raise and regulate armies. The general government can regulate the army. It directs them to raise and regulate armies; or if it does not direct them, it does not authorize them. This power is in the general government, and cannot be given by the general government. If the power of raising and regulating armies is so important and necessary, the general government has not the right to give it. The powers of Congress are such as are necessary. It is a power given, not by the constitution, but by the people; and it is a power which we cannot give. It is a power which the people have not given us. This is a great argument against giving it. It is a power which we cannot give. It is a power which we have not taken. This is a great argument in favor of not giving it. It is a power which is not given. It is an absolute and unqualified power. If we give this power, it will be a kind of a surrender to the people of their rights. If we did not give it, it would be a surrender to tyranny. If it is a surrender, we will make it an absolute and unqualified one.

Mr. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, there is a good deal of ingenuity in these arguments; and they are all in favor of giving that power to Congress. I should call your attention to the fact, that the power of raising armies was not given by the constitution, but by the people; and that, under a government of limited powers, it can never be given. That is the rule of the house. It is the rule of the committee. It is the rule of the convention. It is the rule of the house. It is the law of the land, and must be obeyed by the people of this country. If we do not obey it, it is true that we shall not pay the debts. If we do not pay the debts, the government will go to the bank for money; and, in the meantime, we shall have no government. It is true that we shall have no government, but what! If the general government cannot raise and regulate armies, can it raise and regulate armies? If the Constitution can not raise and regulate armies, can the general government raise and regulate armies? If the people of

He says that one ground of complaint,
==================== COMPLETION 68 ====================
 in the state of New York, was that the militia was not regularly organized, and he will enlarge on that subject.

I do not remember having heard any gentleman offer any other ground, except to say, that the general government was not authorized to call out the militia. The general government has always been called out. Whenever the general government has been called out, the militia has been called out. It is said that the general government is now established, and the power of calling out the militia has been given to the states, and that therefore the states have the right of calling out their militia. I ask, what is the point of complaint? Is it that the power was given to the states, or that the states have the right of calling out their militia? The power was given to the states, and the states have the right to call out their militia. The states have the right to call out their militia.

It is said, that the states, by their allegiance to the United States, have a right to call out their militia. The government is the same with the states. We are the government of the United States. We have given the power to the states, and the states have the right to call them out. The states have a right of calling out their militia, and it is the duty of the general government to call out their militia in order to maintain the union.

Mr. MADISON. I have no objection to the general government calling out the militia, except in those cases in which the states have the right of calling out their militia, and it is the duty [to] the general government to call out the militia, and to maintain the union. If it be necessary for the general government to call out the militia, it is a necessary power.

Mr. CHAS. MASON. "The states have the right of calling out their militia, and it is the duty of the general government to call out the militia, and to maintain the union."

Mr. WILSON. The states have a right to call out their militia; but no more than the general government has the right to call out the militia. The states have no power to call out the militia. They are vested with no power of calling out their militia.

Mr. CHAS. MASON. The states have the right of calling out their militia, and it is the duty of the general government to call out the militia, and to maintain the union.

Mr. WILSON. The states have no power to call out their militia; but the general government has the right to call out the militia. The states have no power to call out the militia; but the government has the right to call out the militia.

Mr. GOVERNOR. Mr. Chairman, the states have no power to call out the militia; but the government has the power to call out the militia.

Mr. CHAS. MASON. The states have no power to call out their militia; but the government has the power to call out the militia.

Mr. WILSON. The government has a right to call out the militia. I believe the first thing we should do is to ascertain what the government has the right to call out, and then we will ascertain what the states have the right to call out, and after that we can proceed to a discussion of the relative rights of the states and the general government. If the government has the right to call out the militia, by that right it is the duty of the state governments to call out their militia.

Mr. HENRY. I agree with the gentleman from Connecticut. The states have no power to call out their militia. It is the duty of the general government

Anyway, back to Vainglory: unveiled in September 2014 on-stage during an Apple keynote, then launched for iOS devices in November, with an Android version currently in closed beta.

Like League of Legends, Vainglory is a MOBA, where two teams of individual players battle it out for control of a level with gameplay blending action and strategy in equal measure. Segerstrale says its players are currently averaging 75 minutes
==================== COMPLETION 69 ====================
 per match, which is markedly higher than the average League of Legends game.

"We see a lot of people play the game for 20 or 30 minutes, but in reality people consistently spend 50 minutes to an hour on the game," he says. "It's not some casual game. It's a hardcore game, so we're seeing people with a lot of skill. People have a lot of skill to play, and you're trying to beat them.

"You're trying to win, essentially. It's the most competitive way of playing a game. That's what we see."

The game's ability to stimulate competition and engagement is unique, according to Segerstrale.

"Most of the games are…a little bit more casual. They are not very competitive. But this is a competitive game with a lot of depth. We're not seeing a lot of games that are going to get people excited about getting involved in competitive play. This is one of the few that does.

"The things that make it so competitive is that we've created one of the best experiences on mobile with this beautiful art style, and the gameplay," he adds. "So, it's definitely a game that will attract a lot of people who are looking for that type of competitive feel."

The game's matchmaking is robust, with plenty of servers to choose from. And with a cross-platform matchmaking system that takes into account what you've played on PC, and what you've played on mobile, it's easy to find matches near you.

"We're seeing a lot of people playing the game for 20 or 30 minutes, but in reality people consistently spend 50 minutes to an hour on the game," says Segerstrale.

"It's not some casual game. It's a hardcore game, so we're seeing people with a lot of skill. People have a lot of skill to play, and you're trying to beat them. You're trying to win, essentially. It's the most competitive way of playing a game. That's what we see."

The game's success is in part dependent on its matchmaking and community. It's one of the few mobile games with a large user base in its native territory of South Korea.

"I think there is an opportunity for the game in that it is very unique. It's very different from the other mobile games," Saeim says. "A lot of people are really excited about it, and I think it's also a very fun game, and I think that's the thing that makes it unique.

"It's a game that can appeal to people who are not normally into games, and it's a game that can appeal to people who are into mobile games, and also appeal to people who are into competitive games.

"And if you're into competitive games, you're going to play for a long time. You're going to have a lot of fun. And if you're into mobile games, it's a game that's not going to disappear overnight. It's something that's going to be very viable for a long time."

Segerstrale says that Vainglory's success will depend on whether it keeps its eSports focus.

"We're going to continue to push it and see how far we can go with it," he says. "We're going to see how far we can take it. But you can't do that if you're just going to focus on that. You have to keep in mind the game can appeal to a lot of people, so we're going to stay on the lookout for that.

"We think this is going to be a very big opportunity for us," he says. "In terms of business, if we can scale this up to the level of League of Legends, then it's going to be a very significant business for us."

Xbox One and PS4 owners will be able to play Vainglory on their consoles soon, with a PC release scheduled for later this year.

The future of eSports

Analysts have estimated the eSports industry will be worth $1bn in 2017. But Vainglory is a much younger game than that, with most of its players appearing in the US and Europe.

Among those who won't be satisfied with that valuation are game developers, who see it as a lost opportunity to get their games into the hands of more people.

"I think it's great for the players, great for the game industry, and I think it's going to be a huge opportunity for technical innovation," says Ubisoft's Dave Jones.

But it's also going to create some fascinating new business models for players.

"You don't have to buy into the hype that everyone else is putting out there. [You can] get in early and start building a fan base of your game," says Segerstrale.

"The only thing that can stop that is a lack of innovation."

To learn more, watch our video interview with Segerstrale.

Activision Blizzard is investing in eSports, too (thanks, Activision!), with League of Legends franchising now up and running in five countries, including North America and Europe, one of which, North America, is a PC-only region.

But the company is more interested in the massive, macro potential of the eSports industry than the localised versions that exist at the moment.

The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said in a statement that the 38-year-old man, identified by his family as Song Son-woo, had been living in North Korea for less than a year. Song was granted permission to return to South Korea on May 18.

Song, who had been using the pseudonym Kim So-young, was arrested on Friday after a customs official found that he was carrying drugs, police said. He was charged with possessing illegal drugs and is being held in a detention facility.

"It is not clear at this time what the drugs were," the police said in a statement. "The suspect stated that he had gone to North Korea to seek business opportunities, but the police are still investigating."

The suspect was granted permission to return to South Korea on May 18, after which he began searching for opportunities in South Korea. Song later returned to North Korea and was arrested on May 22.

South Korea has maintained a policy of arresting people who attempt to enter the North illegally.

"I think the biggest thing that differentiates it from League of Legends is that it's about player choice," he says. "A lot of people have a basic understanding of League of Legends, and I think that's the main driving force: it's about how you choose to play the game.

"In League of Legends it's very clear to the player: let's pick this character, and let's play with this team. In Vainglory, that's not possible, so you're given all these tools – you can choose your character, you can choose your teammates.

"There's also a lot more to it than just that, which is why you see so many different heroes at the start. Whereas in League of Legends you'd see a hero like Nasus, or even Zac – you'd play a bit with them, and then it was on to the next champ. In Vainglory you're given a lot of options, and you can play with a lot of different heroes.

"You can play, say, a tank, or you can play a DPS, or you can play a support, or you can play a support and a tank, or you can play a DPS and a support. You can play a support and a tank. You can play a support and a DPS.

"So when you're playing as a support, you're not just playing a support. When you're playing as a tank, you're not playing a tank and a support. It's more like you have a lot more options."

This is where a lot of the game's appeal lies, as players can build their own characters in the game's 'theme' system, or find a team of players to play alongside.

"I think it's a really interesting concept, the choice system," says Segerstrale. "I think it's really interesting that you can play as a tank, and you can play as a support. It's just not the usual way of playing, and that's what's so great about it.

"I think it's a really great concept: a lot of people have a basic understanding of League of Legends, and I think that's the main driving force: it's about how you choose to play the game.

"In League of Legends it's very clear to the player: let's pick this character, and let's play with this team. In Vainglory, that's not possible, so you're given all these tools – you can choose your character, you can choose your teammates.

"There's also a lot more to it than just that, which is why you see so many different heroes at the start. Whereas in League of Legends you'd see a hero like Nasus, or even Zac – you'd play a bit with them, and then it was on to the next champ. In Vainglory you're given a lot of options.

"You can play, say, a tank, or you can play a DPS, or you can play a support, or you can play a support and a tank, or you can play a DPS and a support. You can play a support and a tank. You can play a support and a DPS. You can play a support and a DPS.

"So when you're playing as a support, you're not just playing a support. When you're playing as a tank, you're not playing a tank and a support. It's more like you have a lot more options."

(A quick primer if you've landed on this article with no prior knowledge of this area: eSports refers to video games played competitively for an audience – millions of people online on sites like Twitch, and/or tens of thousands of fans in real-world arenas. There are professional teams in this world, and increasingly-big prizes as sponsors pile in to the market.

But it's a world still under the radar of the media industry, even with Amazon buying Twitch for $970m and ESPN experimenting with broadcasting eSports on its TV channels. And eSports is an increasingly broad church, taking in PC games like League of Legends and Counter-Strike, console franchises like Call of Duty and FIFA, with mobile games getting into this space too.)

Anyway, back to Vainglory: unveiled in September 2014 on-stage during an Apple keynote, then launched for iOS devices in November, with an Android version currently in closed beta.

Like League of Legends, Vainglory is a MOBA, where two teams of individual players battle it out for control of a level with gameplay blending action and strategy in equal measure. Segerstrale says its players are currently averaging 75 minutes

 a match, but "more like 200-250 minutes if you're playing ranked."

Vainglory's hero roster is a mix of traditional fantasy fantasy creatures, like Ursula, a gremlin with a human torso, and "fantasy monsters" like dragons and fish.

There's a lot of strategy involved in playing the game, with teams often having to switch heroes mid-match depending on the enemy hero they're facing.

The game is free to play, with in-app purchases and IAPs at the end of matches that unlock new heroes and cosmetic items.

It's available on iOS and Android.<|endoftext|>No JavaScript? We need that :(

In her view, Britain has gone backwards when it comes to "equality of opportunity".

The ideal of equal opportunities was enshrined in the Equality Act of 2010, which is designed to fight pervasive discrimination and implicit bias in Britain. It is a key plank of Labour's programme for government.

That's why last week, the government unveiled the Everyday Sexism project, an initiative dedicated to tackling sexism. The project includes a network of more than 2,000 businesses, local authorities and organisations that will raise awareness of all forms of discrimination.

"For too long, women have been more likely to be the victims of serious violence than the perpetrators," said Karen Bradley, minister of state for women and equalities, underlining the point that the project does not target women.

Bradley, who has been a leading light in this campaign, has a lot to do in a short space of time. She was invited to address the first Women's March in London in January, but decided to skip the event. She was also criticised for trying to get a meeting with the Guardian to discuss the project in February.

Bradley insists the Everyday Sexism project is about equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome.

The new initiative is the brainchild of TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady, who is campaigning for a £10,000 basic state pension for all women. This would be a huge victory for the millions of women who have not seen a real rise in their income since the economic crash in 2008.

The government's basic state pension will cost more than £10bn over the next parliament. O'Grady is keen to show that a women's state pension is a "more important" goal than the one Labour has set for the country. She wants to make sure that the basic state pension has all the benefits of a state pension and none of the drawbacks.

It would also give women more time to spend with their families and less time on unpaid work. "A state pension should be a right, not a luxury," O'Grady said.

The TUC's Jim Murphy is also keen to show women that the issue of equality is not only about what women get ahead of men, but about how men can get ahead of women. He wants to make sure that men's pay is raised to match the women's pay.

In a speech to the TUC in October, Murphy said: "Men need to be paid more than women, but not only that. We need to make

Heavy rail proposals for the Docklands 1979 – 1982

Meanwhile, in December 1982 the plug was officially pulled on the plans to extend the Jubilee line when the GLC didn't seek to renew the Parliamentary powers for the Stage 2 extension to Fenchurch Street. The LDDC press release of 7 October 1982 about DLR had this as a farewell eulogy of the Jubilee extension scheme:

The challenge was to find the best system which could be implemented with the funds available. The extension of the Jubilee Line was a proposal which perhaps best met the needs of the area, but the very high costs of construction means it is not high now on the Government's list of priorities.

This was all at the time when Transport was a poor relation of Government, previously being a subsidiary of the Department of the Environment. When Heseltine, at Environment, presented DLR at the Conservative Party Autumn 1982 conference as the solution to Docklands

 issues, he was greeted by jeers and laughter from the audience.

He was also heckled by the City of London Corporation's head of operations as he walked out of the conference.

The Docklands regeneration debate was in full swing at the time and the Docklands Development Corporation (of which the DLR was a part) was the most significant player in the regeneration debates.

The GLC had been formed in 1979 by the merger of the Docklands Development Corporation and the Docklands Development Corporation (DFDC). It was headed by Gordon Brown and was the leading force in the Docklands regeneration debates.

In a good piece for the London Magazine dated 21 March 1984, Iain Walker wrote:

Iain Walker, the architect of the Docklands, has another theory. "The idea that the DLR would be the solution to the Docklands problem was the cause of the whole thing," he says. "The original proposals were for a spur to the existing East London mainline, and there was a lot of opposition to this. The government decided that the DLR was the best answer because it would come later, and it would be easier to build."

Few people in the Docklands lived in the old East London mainline, and it was a very small area. However, it was the largest parish in the London borough of Croydon, with almost 30,000 inhabitants.

Walker concluded:

The DLR would have been a very good solution, but it wasn't the solution, and it wasn't the right solution. The DLR was the wrong solution because it was a spur to the existing East London mainline, and that was the wrong answer. And the DLR was the right answer because it was a spur to the existing East London mainline, and that gave the area a much better chance of regeneration.

The DLR was expensive and it was due to be built on a site in East London where the railway was already built.

The DLR was a spur to the existing East London mainline, and the East London mainline was already built, and the DLR was a spur to the existing East London mainline, and there was very little chance of it being built at all.

The DLR was no more a solution than the Jubilee extension was a solution. But the DLR was a idea that got to the heart of the Docklands problem. It was not a solution to the Docklands problem which was about a lack of transport capacity. It was a solution to the Docklands problem because it was a solution to the Docklands problem.

 congestion, he was making the case for a high-speed rail network.

In the early 1980s, Transport's role was to fund and deliver the economic infrastructure of the capital, the transport network was a secondary concern.

The other big issue to be addressed by the DLR – and which would have been a high priority for the London Transport Board at this time – was the expansion of the DLR and the growth of the Docklands.

The DLR was planned to be extended to the south by a new spur which would have taken the line up to New Cross. This was always going to be controversial and the project was dropped. To carry out this extension of the DLR was to take on the role of the GLC's Capital Plan.

However, this decision was not taken without a fight. In the early 1980s, there was a serious lack of funds for the Docklands. This was because the GLC had planned to raise the rate of charge on the remainder of the Docklands TA from 8% to 12% to replace the ten year old charges. The GLC and the federal government had to agree to the increase, but the local authority were not happy.

The docklands were concerned that the GLC was planning to get rid of them, and in particular of the East London Improvement Scheme. They thought the money would have been better spent on building the DLR up from the east of the Thames, and that the Docklands TA would have been better off with a higher rate of charge.

In the end, the GLC decided that the East London Improvement Scheme was not worth it, but that it would go back to the Docklands TA to discuss this further.

The Docklands TA then got together and put together a detailed proposal to the London Transport Board for a feasibility study of a new East London Improvement Scheme. The GLC would not have approved this, but the TA did.

The Rotherhithe Branch was replaced in the late 1980s by a new branch to New Cross. The St. Martin's Road Branch was developed as a station and would have been the major new terminus of the DLR.

The Docklands TA also created the Docklands Rail Study Group to look into the Docklands' future.

The Docklands Rail Study Group worked vigorously on the Docklands Rail Study over the years, with a number of proposals for new stations being presented to the GLC. However, this was largely political, and the GLC did not have the funds to implement many of the proposals.

The DLR was dropped from Transport's focus.

The Docklands were not happy with this, and a series of meetings were held with then Transport Secretary Roy Jenkins, and DLR Chairman Sir John Goff. They talked about the Docklands TA continuing to work together, the Docklands TA having a role to play in Transport's proposal for the Docklands and the Docklands TA continuing to look into this, but with the Docklands TA only being able to do so with the GLC's funding. However, the GLC had not been able to agree to the DLR extension which was the GLC's major cause for concern.

At the time, the GLC still had the authority to grant permission for Docklands projects, and so the Docklands TA had a green light to carry on with their proposals for a new East London Improvement Scheme.

But they were now going to have to fight for the money to carry out the scheme.

The Docks East Extension was a good idea, but the docklands didn't like it.

The Docklands TA also had a plan to redevelop the area to an even greater extent than the East London Improvement Scheme

 transport problems he went to the trouble of informing the Conservative Party Conference committee that he was, for some reason, the Minister for Transport.

The Stage 2 extension was, however, the only significant scheme on the Docklands which was considered viable at the time. The other schemes, including the High Speed Rail (HSR) scheme to the West Side of London, were also expensive, but would ultimately prove not to be viable.

Phase one and two of the DLR plans were to be built between the Jubilee and Thamesmead lines. Phase one was to have a new line from South Bond Street to Shoreditch. The first phase of the line would have a total length of 2.5km, with a total of 40 stations from Shoreditch to Stratford. As a result of the problems with the original plan it was decided to extend this first phase 2.5km to the West End.

The second phase of the DLR scheme was to be a much larger scheme, with a total length of 4.5km. Unlike Phase 1, the first phase of this phase would be built between the Jubilee and Thamesmead lines. In this phase the line would extend to Charing Cross, and would have a total length of 6km. This phase would also have an elevated section.

The plan was for the new DLR line to run from South Bond Street to the West End. The West End stations would be at Charing Cross, Waterloo, Tower Bridge, Elephant and Castle, and Victoria. A second bus-only underground line would be built from Palace station to the West End, and this would serve the stations of Waterloo and Elephant and Castle.

Phase three was to be a new bus and rail link to the West End between the new DLR station at West India Quay, and the existing DLR station at Elephant and Castle. This previously proposed link would have a total length of 16km, with a total of 75 stations. The new line would also have two new tunnels, one to the north of the existing DLR line, and the other to the south of the existing DLR line.

The remaining phase of the DLR scheme would have a total length of 8km. This phase would have a total length of 8.5km. The new line would end at the existing DLR station at Liverpool Street, and would also serve the new DLR station at Elephant and Castle. A new underground line would also be built from Elephant and Castle to the West End.

Phase four would have a total length of 12km. This phase would also have a total length of 12.5km. The new line would end at the existing DLR station at Liverpool Street, and would also serve the new DLR station at Elephant and Castle. A new underground line would also be built from Elephant and Castle to the West End.

The new DLR line was to be built as a separate line to be built in the east of the Docklands. This would have a total length of 32km, with a total of 135 stations.

The DLR proposals were not a great success, and the scheme was cancelled in 1985. The next stage of the Docklands scheme was the Big Dig.

Don Tower Planning the Big Dig

The Big Dig was a huge project which involved digging a tunnel under the River Thames to the Docklands, and then under the River Thames as it came out of the Thames Estuary. The scheme was designed to reduce pollution by providing a huge tunnel to carry the sewage from the Docklands to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The tunnel would have been 7.5km (4 miles) long.

 housing problems, it was his team's understanding that the Conservative Government would not support the scheme.

In the meantime, the Transport Department was planning a huge scheme to solve the Docklands housing problems via a huge scheme of transport infrastructure including the Elephant, Jubilee and Docklands line extension. These works could and should have been built, but were refused by the GLC.

In October 1982, a huge delegation from all over Europe including the Irish politicians, the Docklands promoters, the Irish Labour Party and the Docklands Docklands Committee, visited London to seek support for a scheme to extend the Docklands Stage 2 to Borough High Street and Borough Road in order to provide a link to the Port of London and thereby improve Docklands housing and make it more attractive to new workers, whether they be from outside or from the existing workforce.

The proposals in hand, the Irish delegation sought a £500m loan and for a time this was given, but ever since the DLR plans were rejected, the Irish delegation have remained opposed to extending the Docklands Stage 2 to Borough Road and Borough High Street.

There is, of course, the ongoing problem of the lack of funding for the Docklands transport infrastructure, irrespective of how much support the Irish delegation got from the Irish government and NI Government.

In Rotherhithe, the DLR business case was the basis of the construction of the DLR line extension to Borough High Street.

The Rotherhithe Docklands Development Company's project report, 'The Docklands Transport Project' published on 28th May 1986, was the basis of the Government's decision to build the DLR line extension to Borough Road and Borough High Street.

The report was prepared by the 'Rotherhithe Docklands Development Company' which was set up in 1985.

The DLR business case was assembled by a group of developers who had been involved in the Docklands for several years, including Frank Cross, Michael Harland, John Shrigley, Frederick Marsden, William Kavanagh, Peter Cairns, and Richard Warburton.

The DLR business case was set out in seven sections. It set out the economic benefits for the DLR and the Docklands area and included the following:

The DLR was proposed to be built at an average cost of £61m per mile for the first part of the line to replace the existing 4km, 20 year, surface rail line to the docks and cost £24m per mile for the second part of the line to Borough Road and Borough High Street.

The DLR would provide 42,000 jobs over the next 20 years with an annual payroll of £1.8 billion, the equivalent of the annual payroll of the whole of London's City and Westminster.

The DLR would be the first modern tube line with the capacity to carry all trains at a single ticketing point, replacing the existing trains that only run at a single station.

The DLR would effectively link the Docklands to the City and Westminster and the East End.

The DLR would provide a link to the City and Westminster and the East End. It would lead to the removal of over ten miles of the Docklands tunnels and two bridges.

The DLR would provide a major transport link between the Docklands and the City and Westminster.

The DLR would provide a major transport link between the Docklands and the City and Westminster. The DLR would remove the need for a special express service to the City and Westminster.

Updates!

It's been a while since I've updated this, but I've got a bunch of new stuff that I've been working on. Here's a list of things that I've been working on.

New HUD!

With the release of 1.3 the HUD became a lot more flexible. Thanks to some new tricks I found out, I could add a lot more to the HUD and it's now rounded off to a much nicer size.

A lot of the new stuff is in the "welcome_center" file. I've updated the header so it's almost identical to the 1.2 version, but I've also included a few new entries.

This is a list of the new things that I've added:

A "Threat Enemy" HUD!

From 7 to 1

Updates!

This week I've been working on the new boss and the new maze.

Here's a screenshot:

And here's a video:

I've been working on my map, and I think it's finally starting to come together though it's still very rough, especially in the maze. I'm not sure if I'll have time to get this finished though.

Update:

I posted another update on the forums, so here it is:

To go from one extreme to the other is a reaction to a reaction - and is codependent. There are choices in between which are sometimes hard for us to see if we are reacting. To go from tolerating verbally abusive behavior to leaving a relationship in one step is swinging between extremes. It is helpful to set boundaries that allow for some gradual change.When I ask you what is wrong and you say "Never mind," and then slam cabinet doors and rattle pots and pans and generally seem

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)

After not being able to find a starting quarterback for the past two seasons, the Seattle Seahawks are set to add an experienced arm to their quarterback room. According to Adam Schefter, the Seahawks have signed Geno Smith.

Smith will join the Seahawks as the heir apparent to Russell Wilson.

Smith played for the Jets from 2011 to 2013, and was considered by many to be the best quarterback in the NFL at the time. The Jets chose not to re-sign Smith after he was arrested in 2013 on charges of driving under the influence and possession of marijuana. He was released by the Jets after the arrest and has not appeared in an NFL game since 2011.

Smith was arrested again last year for disorderly conduct.

Smith is a 6-foot-5, 245-pound quarterback who missed all of the 2014 season due to a torn ACL. The Seahawks are expected to add a veteran quarterback -- likely in the form of Colin Kaepernick -- to compete with Smith for the starting job. The Seahawks also added veteran quarterback Matt Flynn to compete with Wilson for the starting job in camp.

The Seahawks have a deep stable of quarterbacks including Wilson, Flynn, Tarvaris Jackson, Trevone Boykin, Bryce Love and one of the NFL's top draft prospects in Mitch Trubisky.

The Seahawks are expected to release veteran quarterback Tarvaris Jackson this week, and the team could very well add a veteran to compete with Seattle's current crop of quarterbacks.

 to be throwing a temper tantrum, that is a problem. In fact, that may be a sign of a problem. Is he/she verbally abusive? Yes. Is your patience running thin? Yes. Is he/she throwing temper tantrums or making major life decisions? Yes. Is he/she making major life decisions? Yes. Is he/she behaving in ways that you are not comfortable with? Yes. Perhaps it is time to get out of this relationship, regardless of the fact that you have spent your whole life with him/her. The fact that you are making a decision to leave is great - let your emotional feelings be what they may.I suggest that you figure out those emotions, and then figure out how to deal with them. If you do that, your relationship will be better for it. I am not suggesting that you start screaming at him/her or trying to break things down. It is a time to take your time and get to know the other person. If you keep yelling at him/her, you are going to make it very hard to get back together. This is very true. You are going to have to be patient in getting to know the other person. This is a good thing.If you can't be patient with him/her for one reason or another, you are not ready for a relationship. This is a very important word to remember. It is really the only way to really know if you have the right person for you. You can't just go on the most wonderful date with the most wonderful person you have ever met, and then decide after the fact that you have to break up with him/her because you are "not ready". It just doesn't work that way. When you start talking to someone, you are always at the beginning of a relationship. When you are talking to someone, you are always at the beginning of the relationship. There is no such thing as a "just right" person.If you are not ready to go out with the person, then you cannot tell him/her that you are not ready to be in a relationship with him/her. You can only tell him/her that you are not ready to be with him/her right now. You can tell him/her that you have other friends in your life, and that you are going to be spending some time with them. You can tell him/her that you are going to spend some time with your parents, and that you are not ready to have a relationship with them yet. You can tell him/her that you are not ready to be with him/her right now. I know that it is hard to hear, but you have to do what you feel is best for you. You can't force someone to be with you, but you can allow them to remain friends if they are not ready to be a couple.Sometimes, you just have to let go. You have to let go of the "you're wrong, I'm right" mentality that will work against you in the long run. You have to accept that you might get the person you want in the end - but you might also get the person you want in the end that you didn't want in the beginning. It is a matter of letting go. If you feel this is true, then you are ready for a relationship.Yes. I just really want to be friends with you and you are not interested in that. It is possible that you just don't know how to be friends with someone who doesn't want to be friends with you. That is a possibility. You can try to get to know this person, and see what works for both of you. If you really want to be friends, make a commitment to date this person. If you don't,

 to be in another world, I feel that I am being manipulated into a situation where I am responsible for you.I have read that "Treatment is the final stage of codependency." And when I ask you what your treatment plan is, you tell me in a monotone, matter of fact manner that you are "working on it." I have spent the last several months working on myself for codependency and want to see you work on yourself.One of the things that I have found helpful has been to always ask myself "What am I willing to do to get you to change?" I want to know that I am not going to have to be the one who is forced to accept your way out of your dysfunction. I have not had to do much of it to get you to change.If you are willing to work on yourself for a while, I will consider working on you. If you are unwilling to change, I will not be the one to force you to make the change. It is my job to be there to help you and to remove you from situations that are not working for you. I want you to have the power to get your life back on track.It can be very difficult to tell a codependent that he or she will be leaving. No one likes to have their sense of self undermined. Some people need a constant reassurance that they are good enough. Others need to feel that someone cares about them. In the long run, those people who feel they are being taken care of behave better when someone else takes care of them. To get removed from a codependent, it is important to put in the effort to show that you are a good person who is going to take care of yourself, not a good person who is taking care of someone else.I have found that it is very helpful to take the step of telling your codependent that you are leaving. It is also helpful to set up a date that you feel comfortable about only to talk to him or her about it. If you can get a date in writing, that is better. If you can get a date on your cell phone, that is better. If you can get a date to a place that doesn't have many other people around, that is better.If you are still in a relationship with your codependent, it is also important to take a step back from the relationship. It is a very painful thing to have to do, but I have found that I have to take that step because I have to feel safe and secure in my own life again. If I am in a relationship with someone who is controlling and abusive, I am constantly in a state of anxiety and fear. I cannot leave. It is a chemical response to any threat. So I have to work on myself to take responsibility for my own life.I wish I had known about "Therapy" sooner. I wish I had known that I could get help. I wish I had known that there were people who could help me. Now I know. I am glad I did. I am a better person - and my life is better for it.<|endoftext|>Snoop Dogg has had the world at his feet in the past decade.

The Italian government last year launched an investigation into the book, Amanda Knox in Perugia, written by Italian journalist Claudio D'Alessandro and published in October. The book claims Knox, a British-based university graduate, is a liar who made up details of her abduction and murder to avoid jail.

Knox and her family have refused to comment on the book.

"The Italian government has decided to launch a criminal investigation into a book that alleges that Amanda Knox lied to police about her alleged abduction and murder," Knox's lawyers, Federico Macheda and Massimo Mollica, said in a statement on Saturday.

"The action, which is being taken in a few days, is designed to prevent publication of the book and to prevent the release of information that would be harmful to Amanda Knox and her defence team."

The book claims that Knox, a 21-year-old student at the University of Washington, was forced to kill Meredith Kercher by Kercher's former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, in November 2007.

Sollecito was convicted of the murder in 2009 and is serving a 25-year prison sentence.

Knox, who was studying abroad in Perugia at the time of the murder, initially denied any involvement in the murder, but later changed her story.

The Italian government is now investigating Knox's claims of being a victim of an abduction and murder conspiracy.

Knox and Sollecito both spent five years in jail for the murder before being acquitted in 2009.<|endoftext|>A few years ago, I tried to explain to my two beautiful daughters, Emma and Zoey, that black people had more in common with us than we thought.

I told them that we see our black friends being killed every day, but we don't talk about it. I asked them to imagine being a black person in the US, and explain why black people are treated differently from us by the criminal justice system.

I told them that I knew that they would appreciate being black in the US. My daughters understood that they would be proud to be black in the US, and I told them that I believed that they would be proud to be black people in the US.

iving a now three year-old question.

Who is Son "Mickey" Young-min?

The old adage that one's only consistent quality is their inconsistency describes Mickey at all stages of his career. His highlights, mechanical outplays and rare ability to singlehandedly carry a team in a world where League of Legends has increasingly become more team-oriented are all part of Mickey's allure. Teams will continue to take chances on him as long as he retains those mechanics, and Team Liquid is simply the latest in line.

In 2014, Mickey was ahead of the curve, for better or for worse.

While Chinese teams didn't begin importing Korean players in earnest until the 2014-15 offseason, Mickey was part of a first test wave, so to speak, of Korean imports to China that also included Prime Optimus' Kim "Khan" Dong-ha and Noh "Ninja" Geon-woo moving to World Elite, which is now known as Team WE. Mickey (then called Mickeygod) was plucked straight from the Korean solo queue ladder due to his individual mechanics and high placement.

Had Team WE done a bit more scouting, they would have known that Mickey, a Lee Sin mid player, was
==================== COMPLETION 93 ====================
 also the team's jungler, and had the luxury of selecting their jungler instead of Mickey, who would have been a more difficult choice for a title team at the time.

If Team WE did have a scouting department, they were neglecting to use it.

Logically, this should have been a no-brainer, especially given Mickey's history.

Mickey was a top rift solo queue player, and was an integral part of a championship roster in 2014. He was also a member of Team WE's 2014 World Champions, and was widely regarded as the best jungler in China at the time. Team WE and Mickey were not at odds; the team was fully aware of his potential, and he was a key cog in the machine, even if he sometimes had a hard time keeping it running.

But the decision to bring him to China was less about Mickey's skill and more about Chinese team dynamics.

Team WE had been in China for almost two years at the time, and it was a form of isolationist behavior that only worked in the short term. As a result, Team WE's Chinese players were not as familiar with the team's general philosophy and playstyle, and thus Mickey was limited in his potential impact.

Team WE's general philosophy consisted of a heavy emphasis on the mid lane and mid lane duo lane, and a focus on early game pushes and rotations based on the strength of the mid laner's champion pool. Team WE's mid laner, Wei "WeiXiao" Han-Wei, was a mid lane playmaker with a strong laning phase, but was far from a player who could win a teamfight, and was therefore more limited in his impact.

This was another reason why Team WE, despite having a clear vision for who they wanted to be, did not have a clear vision for who Mickey would be. The player they chose to acquire was not the player they wanted, and did not fit their vision for how they wanted to play.

It was a knee-jerk reaction, perhaps, but it was one that was doomed to fail.

Mickey had a better understanding of the Chinese meta, and was more willing to adapt his playstyle to the metagame. He was also more willing to take risks than Weixiao, who was more content to play safety and have little impact on the game.

Team WE had a tendency to resort to "cookie-cutter" strategies, which had the same results regardless of team composition, style of play or skill. Their champions were often more powerful than those of other teams, and they were less willing to challenge themselves with unorthodox picks. This was part of the reason why their success was often short-lived, as they were unable to adapt to their opponents' strategies and playstyles.

This was a problem for Team WE, as Mickey was a player with the potential to evolve into a more unique player. Team WE had a team composition that was more focused on early game pressure than Fnatic. If Mickey had been more willing to take risks and adapt his playstyle to the meta, he would have been able to break out of the "cookie-cutter" trap the team had set for him.

Mickey's familiarity with the Chinese meta also made him a much better pick for the team's mid lane. Wei "WeiXiao" Han-Wei was not known for his macro play, rather his laning phase was more about keeping the lane pushed and snowballing his advantage. Mickey, by contrast, was known for his mid game play, and his ability to set up teamfights and lead teamfights was a huge asset for Team WE.

Mickey's mechanical weaknesses were not

Who is Son "Mickey" Young-min?

The old adage that one's only consistent quality is their inconsistency describes Mickey at all stages of his career. His highlights, mechanical outplays and rare ability to singlehandedly carry a team in a world where League of Legends has increasingly become more team-oriented are all part of Mickey's allure. Teams will continue to take chances on him as long as he retains those mechanics, and Team Liquid is simply the latest in line.

In 2014, Mickey was ahead of the curve, for better or for worse.

While Chinese teams didn't begin importing Korean players in earnest until the 2014-15 offseason, Mickey was part of a first test wave, so to speak, of Korean imports to China that also included Prime Optimus' Kim "Khan" Dong-ha and Noh "Ninja" Geon-woo moving to World Elite, which is now known as Team WE. Mickey (then called Mickeygod) was plucked straight from the Korean solo queue ladder due to his individual mechanics and high placement.

Had Team WE done a bit more scouting, they would have known that Mickey, a Lee Sin mid player, was
==================== COMPLETION 94 ====================
 starting to shine during the 2015 LPL Spring regular season. He had the potential to be a strong carry in the world's top lane, but he lacked the experience to make it happen in China. Instead, the team relied on Young-min as a substitute, and the young rookie not only performed, but excelled.

Had Team WE done a bit more scouting, they would have known that Mickey, a Lee Sin mid player, was starting to shine during the 2015 LPL Spring regular season.


Another of the new wave of Korean imports was Team SoloMid's Yiliang "Doublelift" Peng, who had played with Prime's Choi "Locodoco" Yoon-sub in 2014. After a rocky start to his time in China, Doublelift was able to regain his confidence and form, and eventually became one of the best top laners in the world.

Yiliang "Doublelift" Peng, who made his debut with Team SoloMid in 2014.

It was in the 2015 LPL Summer regular season where Team WE truly found their "Mickey" and found their "Young-min." They were able to pull off one of the most impressive comebacks in summer history, a performance that was capped off by a game-winning Baron steal late in the series. They were able to pull off the upset in a series that could have gone either way, and out of nowhere, Mickey was called up to the main roster.

Team WE, in 2015, was the first major international team to bring in an import.

He became a fixture on Team WE, not only because of his mechanical ability, but because of his ability to make plays and help fix the team's problems. The team's motivation plummeted when team captain Chen "Pyl" Bo took a leave of absence from the team as a result of his alcoholism, and it took some time to find their footing.

Team WE, in 2015, was the first major international team to bring in an import. Before long, Mickey was on the main roster, and the team finally emerged as a contender.

For Team Liquid, they're taking a gamble on Mickey, but it's one they believe could pay off for them.

Mickey is an incredibly gifted and talented player, and Team Liquid is hoping that he can help them improve. While the team is undoubtedly built to win, they can never be too greedy, and Mickey is a player who can make them pay.

The early preseason splits have shown that Team Liquid is already a polished team, and Mickey has the potential to be the biggest reason why.

Solo queue is a rough place to be. It's a world where a single mistake can cost you games, where a player's voice will drown out those of the other players.

Mickey's skill set is not unlike those of his peers in Korean solo queue, but he's not necessarily a new-comer. He's been playing for top-tier teams for the past three years, and he's a veteran by now. With that kind of experience and his mechanical skill, Mickey's ability to carry can be one of the biggest factors for Team Liquid in the coming split.

Mickey has the ability to make plays, and he's proven to be a strong shotcaller. The question is whether or not he can improve with more experience.

It's safe to say that he's a player who can make a big impact with Team Liquid.

While teams like WE have been building out their rosters, Team Liquid is undergoing a rebuilding process, and Mickey is one of

Mickey (then called Mickeygod) was plucked straight from the Korean solo queue ladder due to his individual mechanics and high placement.

Had Team WE done a bit more scouting, they would have known that Mickey, a Lee Sin mid player, was
==================== COMPLETION 95 ====================
 a massive underperformer on the Chinese version of the game. His mechanics were so bad that he was unable to play the champion in a team game, and he was the only jungler on the team who had a worse win rate than the rest of the top laners and AD carries. Mickey's mechanics would continue to be bad throughout his career and were one of the biggest reasons why he was never able to break out of the bottom lane.

Had Team WE picked a more mechanically sound jungler, like Cai "Mata" Seong-hyeong, they may not have had the same problems with Mickey. But because they picked Mickey, they needed to make a choice. They would either have to play with one of the best junglers in the world, or face Mickey's mechanics head on.

That is what Team Liquid chose to do. They started Mickey off on a Jungle/Support duo with Lee "Heart" Gwan-hyung, who has had his own struggles, but also played well enough in the early game to lead his team to their first international win, against Team SoloMid in the 2014 Mid-Season Invitational.

Team WE tried to buy Mickey some time, but with their limited resources, they quickly realized that the champion was just too risky. Mickey eventually fell out of favor with the Chinese community and was never seen again.

Mickey was the exception to the rule, but his rise to stardom is the rule for the rest of Korean imports in China. The trend is for these Korean players to be a bit of a one-hit wonder, which means that they are ahead of the curve a bit, but never quite able to fully break out of that valley. The exception here is GE, who not only won the 2015 LPL Spring, but also became the first Korean player to win the World Championship.

Mickey Young-min's career has been a bit of a roller coaster ride, but with the right team, he could be a major star.

Team Liquid

Mickey's Chinese career began in the 2015 LPL Summer that was won by Team WE. It was also the first time a foreign team had won a direct match in China in over three years, and only the second time in the history of the LPL. The team had the roster of Kim "Deft" Hyukkyu, Hyeong-hwan "KurO" Joo, Lee "Flame" Ho-jae, and Song "Smeb" Kyung-ho.

Team WE went on to win the 2015 LPL Summer, which was their first major tournament win since 2014.

The team's best player at the time was Flame, who was the best player of his region at the time. Flame's playstyle on the champion was a hard-to-replicate one. He would sit back, take Baron, and then engage onto his opponents. He was one of the most mechanically proficient AD carries in the world, and had the highest individual kill participation at the time.

Flame's effectiveness on the champion, and his ability to carry his team by himself, is what came to define Team WE for the rest of 2015. They dominated the regular season of the 2015 LPL Summer, winning the title and playoffs.

Team WE's success came to a screeching halt in the 2015 LPL Season 5 playoffs. They lost to EDward Gaming in the semifinals on a controversial Pray ban and went on to lose the entire tournament to Snake Esports.

However, the team had a bright spot in the form of the Korean mid laner Kim "Khan" Dong-ha. Khan was often the star of the team, but he

Mickey (then called Mickeygod) was plucked straight from the Korean solo queue ladder due to his individual mechanics and high placement.

Had Team WE done a bit more scouting, they would have known that Mickey, a Lee Sin mid player, was
==================== COMPLETION 96 ====================
 the youngest player on the team. His older brother, Lee "Kuro" Seo-haeng, had already been a starter on Najin White Shield, a team that was the first team to import Korean players.

Although Team WE was not ready to take the leap into Korean imports, they were already extremely talented. Mickey was a threat to any team that he faced, and with his unique mechanics, he was an early-game threat.

As it turned out, Mickey's mechanical prowess was only part of what made Team WE so successful during the early days of the Korean shift. The other was the teamwork and synergy of the team. Team WE was no longer the group of five players that could not talk about what they did to the point where everyone in the team was frequently in sync, and they were no longer the team that could not function solo queue.

With Mickey on the team, Team WE developed a reputation as a team that could beat anyone. LPL teams were incredibly hesitant about playing against a team that could win games with a constant lineup of Rengar, Jax, Lee Sin, Fizz, and Gnar. It was a team that had no weaknesses, and was a hard counter to every team in the LPL. It's hard to explain why Mickey can be so effective at a game that has been revamped rather than redone, but it's definitely worth noting.

Team WE had a rough start to the 2015 LPL Spring Split, even going into the first week with a 2-1 series record. The team had time to practice their new strategy against the more experienced LGD Gaming, and they came out of that series with a comfortable 2-0 victory, and the first seed to the playoffs. Unfortunately, they were unable to return to the finals, as they fell to Invictus Gaming in a close three game series.

In the LPL Summer Split, Team WE had a much better start to the split, going 2-0 in week one before dropping games to OMG and EDward Gaming. The team had started the split strong, and Mickey was on the point of becoming one of the best mid laners in the league. He was able to carry his team through the first few weeks of the split, but the rest of the team began to falter.

With Mickey's performances declining, he was often playing with a substitute mid laner. In the end, Team WE finished the split in 6th place, and Mickey was unable to justify his place on the team.

Mickey was swiftly traded to Team SoloMid for the 2015 LPL Summer Split, having been relegated from the LPL a year prior. Team SoloMid was a much more stable team with a much better roster than Team WE, and Mickey was finally able to prove his worth. He was able to singlehandedly carry his team into the playoffs, where they defeated Snake eSports 3-2 in the finals to win the Summer Split title.

After the Summer Split, Team SoloMid decided to make a change in the mid lane position. In the lineup changes that followed, they replaced their AD Carry, Gilius, with jungler, Kim "Procxin" Seong-ung. Although Mickey was found to be a more effective player on the new team, he did not find a new home. He was unable to replicate the success he had with Team WE, and he was eventually given the option to join the newly formed Team Impulse.

Mickey was an extremely talented player who was able to carry Team Impulse to the top of the NA LCS. He was the first player to reach the 6,000 combined gold milestone during the NA LCS, and he has been the most consistent member of the

The new law will go into effect on April 1, 2013. It applies to all ballot measures, including those on a range of issues, including taxes, taxes, taxes, etc.

Article continues below ...

The new law, sponsored by Arizona State Senator Russell Pearce, does not change the law that allows organizations to collect signatures for a ballot initiative or petition if they are not for a ballot measure.

"The new law is not a new law, it is a new statute," said Pearce. "It says that no one can collect signatures to get a ballot initiative or petition without a valid political committee."

Pearce said there was a previous attempt to pass a law that would have made it illegal to collect signatures without a valid political committee, but it died in committee.

The new law, Pearce said, is meant to punish organizations that try to circumvent the law by using people to collect signatures without a valid political committee.

"It would be a violation of the law for any person or organization to collect signatures for a ballot initiative or petition without first obtaining permission from the Secretary of State," Pearce said. "That is why this law is needed."

The law will prevent people from collecting signatures without a valid political committee as it is unconstitutional to do so, Pearce said.

Pearce said that in the past, people have used people as a way to collect signatures for ballot initiatives, and that this new law will make it harder for people to do so again.

He had to make three changes for the trip to London Bees.

Midfielder Scott Hogan, striker Jonny Howson and midfielder Jamie Mackie all had to be rested after they started last Saturday's defeat at home to Blackpool.

McArthur On Fire, Who's Who:

Paul Gallagher, the Head of Football, has once again confirmed that the club intend to secure a new permanent head coach.

While the new appointment will be announced by the time the transfer window reopens in the New Year, Warburton's future at the club is in doubt.

The former Wales and England boss is yet to confirm whether he will stay at the club or is prepared to leave.

Warburton is likely to stay on with the Forest but his future at Nottingham Forest is in doubt.

The Director of Football, Grant O'Brien, is also under pressure and has been in the hotseat since the defeat at home to Blackpool.

O'Brien has been accused of being weak in his management of the squad and his popularity at the club has been dented by the defeat to Blackpool.

It is understood that Warburton does not favour a new head coach at this stage and will be happy with the current squad until the end of the season.

"The question of how much space is available in a bike lane is a legitimate topic for discussion, but a ticket for violating the lane is not," St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said in a statement.

He said it is legal for bicyclists to ride on the sidewalks, but the city's bicycle ordinances don't specifically mention bike lanes.

The department's new policy, he said, "is similar to the one in place in the rest of the state."

The new policy will not apply to drivers stopped at red lights.

In a news release, Dotson did not explain why the department chose to issue tickets instead of issuing warning tickets that do not result in a suspension of the drivers' driving privileges.

Assad's comments came a day after the United States and Russia said they had agreed on a plan aimed at ending the Syrian civil war by mid-2015, but that it could be extended if progress was made.

"We are ready to negotiate," Assad told French television. "But it's not just about a negotiation. I'm not telling you what the conditions are ... It's about a big sacrifice."

In a separate interview, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he expected talks between the sides in Geneva to begin "within a week".

"It is necessary to find a solution that would either end the bloodshed or at least push it to the end. So we have to agree in advance on the concrete steps needed to achieve this outcome," Lavrov said in an interview on the Rossiya 24 television channel.

Lavrov said it was too early to say who would be involved in the talks.

The United States and Russia agreed a plan on Friday to end the conflict in Syria, but Moscow said on Saturday that it was not yet ready to lift a ban on delivering arms to Assad's foes.

Western and Arab nations have accused Assad of committing war crimes with barrel bombs dropped by helicopters on rebels, as well as using chemical weapons.

The Syrian leader has denied the charges.

"An international conference must be held in order to end the bloodshed and find a political solution to the crisis in Syria," Assad said.

He said the issue of Syria's chemical weapons needed to be discussed at any future conference.

"This issue must not be forgotten. It must be discussed in the future," he said.

The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict erupted in March 2011 with anti-government protests.

The term "flanders fields" was coined by John A. MacDonald in the 1930s to describe the "strategic depth" of the Western Front, where the German Army could concentrate its forces in the event of an offensive. In the case of the First World War, it meant the Belgian and Luxembourg Flanders, as well as the French and Luxembourg Flanders. The term "strategic depth" is used in an analogous sense to the terms "heavy" and "light" in the armoured vehicle world. It relates to the fact that the armored vehicle of the Great War was not a super-heavy tank, but an operational vehicle designed to fight in the most rugged terrain, which could be used to support the infantry in an offensive. It was not a true tank, but it helped to maintain the fighting integrity of the infantry.

Following the First World War, the British Army began to develop and manufacture a series of tanks and armoured fighting vehicles, which served as the basis for the modern armoured vehicle system. The first of these, the Light Tank No.1, was initially based on the French Renault FT, but the hull was modified to the Royal Ordnance L13 heavy tank chassis. This was replaced by the L7, which was a slightly modified variant of the L13. The L7 was the first of a series of new tanks which were to be manufactured using the Ordnance L13 chassis. The L7 was the first tank designed to fight without a commander's cupola, which was in the development stages by the time the first prototype was built. When the first prototype was completed, it was fitted with a 16-pounder cannon, which was later removed. The L7 was the first true British tank, and it was the first British tank to be adopted by the British Army.

The British Army was not the only nation to adopt the L7 chassis. The Germans were also very interested in the design, and ordered 100 L7s. The British Army's first L7 tank, the L7A2, was designed to fight in the Netherlands. The Germans sent their own test vehicles to the Netherlands, and the British Army acquired two of these. They were the first British tanks to be delivered to the Western Front.

The Germans had a very successful tank development program, and their tanks were very well regarded by their contemporaries. The British Army however, had an entirely different approach to tank design. Their tank development program was based on the armored car, which, however, was not in the best condition. In 1939, the British Army issued a series of specifications for a tank which would be "fit for the homeland", and in the 1950s, the British Army issued a series of specifications for a tank which would be "fit for the battlefield", which was to be fielded in the First World War.

In the early 1950s, the British Army's tank development program was overhauled when the British Army decided to change its tank development program to focus on a single tank design, with the sole purpose of fulfilling the requirements of the British Army. This tank was to be called the A6 Centurion, and it was to be the main tank for the British Army. The design of the tank was based on the Centurion chassis, but the British Army ordered the Centurion chassis to be used, with the Centurion engine replaced by the Rolls-Royce V12, the first British engine to be installed on an operational tank. The Centurion

AMY GOODMAN: I want to turn to a clip from former Vice President Walter Mondale's talk at the University of Maryland on Thursday. In his speech, he recalled being on a campaign swing through Wisconsin in 1988, when he met a young woman named Mary Kay Henry, a student activist, labor activist, and General Motors worker.

WALTER MONDALE: I was on the road in Wisconsin, and I met Mary Kay Henry. She was a student activist. I went out with her to visit a municipal sewer plant. And she took me into the plant and showed me the water treatment process. And there she was, taking me through the entire process, every step. So I asked her what she thought of the situation. And she said, "Walter, my problem is that I have to—I have to decide tomorrow what I'm going to do. I can't do it by tomorrow." And that was what she meant by "I have to decide tomorrow what I'm going to do." And that was the beginning of the end of her involvement in the Democratic Party.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Walter Mondale speaking Wednesday. Mary Kay Henry died Thursday at age 84. She spent her entire life fighting for workers' rights.

Well, on Friday, we traveled back to Wisconsin to speak to her brother, the late Mary Kay Henry, at his home in Horicon, Wisconsin, where he's lived for 65 years. The family is still very much involved in the struggle, and he was on the phone.

I began by asking him about his sister's death.

MARY KAY HENRY: My sister, Mary Kay, had a very long life. She was a very, very, very active person. She was always involved in the labor movement. She was a very active member of the Socialist Party. And she was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. And she was very, very involved in the anti-war movement. And she was very much involved in the anti-racist movement. And she, you know, believed in the rights of children. She worked for a number of organizations, including the Women's Peace and Freedom Campaign. And she was a very, very active person.

AMY GOODMAN: So, we'll go to the clip of him speaking in 1988. He's talking about the importance of his sister Mary Kay's activism in Wisconsin.

WALTER MONDALE: And I had met her, and right from the beginning she had been involved in the labor movement. And she had been an active member of the Women's Peace and Freedom Campaign. And she was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. She was an organizer. She was a member of the National Committee on Social Security. And she was the operating secretary of a number of different organizations, including the Women's Peace and Freedom Campaign. And she was a very, very active member of the anti-war movement. And she was a very active member of the anti-racist movement. And she was very much involved in the rights of children. She worked for a number of organizations, including the Women's Peace and Freedom Campaign. And she was a very, very active person.

And so, when I met her, I came away very impressed with her. And I decided to endorse her for office and to go out and campaign for her in Milwaukee County. And I remember that she was the one who called me up and said, "Walter, I have to decide tomorrow what I'm going to do." And that was the beginning of the end of her involvement in the

A handful of US military advisers, no more than 50 or so, is all that Washington has inside Syria. That won't give the US the desired leverage it needs to bring the Syrian regime and its military patrons to heel, the experts say.

Currently, the Assad regime has no incentive to negotiate a cessation of hostilities because, for now at least, neither the potpourri of rebels inside Syria nor any outside military force poses an existential threat to the regime.

If a cease-fire is achieved, Butter says it will be because the Russian's want to look like peacemakers - in effect using the US.

"Russia likes having the United States involved because it gives their (peace) effort legitimacy," he said. "Putin said military gains could be capitalized on by bringing in the US to legitimize the peace process."

The US has been reluctant to get involved so far because of the political price that would have to be paid, and the danger that it could be forced to confront Russia head-on.

But if the US is unable to intervene decisively, Butter says, the possibility of an open civil war in Syria will become a real possibility.<|endoftext|>I have a bunch of work in progress.

In a new report, the World Bank's research arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), looks at the bank's spending in the developing world, and it's a big deal. IFC, which is separate from the World Bank, is a private organization that provides the World Bank with financing. It was established in 1994, and it's now the largest private international development bank, with a portfolio of around $60 billion in assets.

The World Bank's vice president for policy and research, Samir Tarar, told me that the IFC's research shows that the bank spends around $40 billion per year on development. That's nearly twice as much as the IFC's official mandate of $12 billion per year.

The IFC's research shows that the World Bank spends around $40 billion per year on development

The IFC's results show that the World Bank's spending on development is quite broad. The bank's biggest multilateral institutions — the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank — spend around a quarter of their budgets on development. But the bank's biggest private funders, including other multilateral institutions, also spend a significant amount of money on development.

So even though the IFC's official mandate is to reduce poverty around the world, there's a lot of spending being done to help people grow richer, to get more goods and services. IFC's results show that around 80 percent of the World Bank's spending goes to those projects.

"The IFC has spent a lot of time looking at the humanitarian side of development," Tarar told me. "But the development side is much more important."

This is all important, because the World Bank faces pressure from within the international community — including in the United States — to rein in its spending.

The reason the IFC's spending is so high is because it's a private organization. Tarar said that the IFC's focus is on helping governments work together to deliver development. "Our mandate is to help countries reach their development targets," he said.

But the IFC is funded by governments, and it can't raise money without them. So the World Bank has to find other sources of financing.

"It's not something that we're proud of, but it is a reality," Tarar said. "We have to figure out what we can do without the public sector."

The World Bank's results on development are much higher than its official mandate, which is about reducing poverty

Some of the World Bank's money goes to improve governance and institutions — a huge issue in many developing countries. But the IFC's research shows that much of

 quickly.

"Russia's way of going about this is to have these temporary cease-fires that give them time to mobilize their resources and bring in a few more troops to try to stabilize the situation," he said.

On the ground, the Syrian government has been targeting civilian areas with airstrikes meant to kill rebels and civilians alike.

The city of Aleppo has been under assault for weeks, and shelling has been used against civilian areas for several weeks. As the siege tightens, the city is becoming increasingly unlivable.

Residents show their bloodied faces as they wait to receive aid from the Red Cross at a makeshift hospital in Aleppo's rebel-controlled area on August 27, 2016.

The US is a signatory to a 2013 cease-fire agreement with Russia that focused on the removal of the Syrian government's chemical weapons stockpile. The pact was broken almost immediately.

The US is also responsible for the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria.

The Russians, however, are not bound by the agreement and they are believed to be responsible for some of the world's deadliest chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin.

The US has no illusions about Russian intentions. If the US is able to get its hands on some of the chemical weapons that the Syrian government has, it will likely be able to convince the Russians to approve the destruction of the entire arsenal instead of removing only the chemical agents.

"We are not going to get all of it," Butter said. "But the US, by opening its eyes, is going to get a lot of it. And I think that will be a game changer."<|endoftext|>The world of sports media has been abuzz with the news that Floyd Mayweather Jr. will be making his long-awaited return to the ring on March 5th in Las Vegas. Most people are wondering how he'll fare in the ring and what he can offer to the boxing world beyond a $100 million payday.

I've talked with some top boxing experts and asked them exactly that. Here's what they had to say:

1. Floyd Mayweather will be a "locked and loaded" fighter

The former undisputed super heavyweight champion is the top pound-for-pound fighter in the world and has been for quite some time now. Mayweather is now 33 years old and has been doing this for a decade. This is his last chance to prove that he can still be the best and that he belongs in the conversation of the greatest ever.

2. Mayweather has never boxed anyone better than him

Mayweather has never boxed anyone better than him. He has been training for this fight for the last few years and he has never had to deal with anyone who can withstand his pressure and power. Mayweather has consistently faced better opponents each time out, and has never been knocked out, so this will be a very different match-up for him.

3. Mayweather will be in peak physical condition for his return

Mayweather is one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world, but he's not the best physical specimen. Mayweather has been training for this fight for over a year, but he will be coming off a few fights in which he was forced to spend time in the hospital. He's been working very hard on his conditioning and the mental aspects of his training as well.

4. Mayweather has never been the underdog

This will be his first time fighting in a boxing match, and he's never been an underdog in any of his previous fights. He has been fighting on the biggest stages of all time for most of his career, and he will be fighting for the first time in a boxing match.

5. Mayweather will be very skilled at defense

 if Russia and the US do not find a way to broker a lasting deal.

"You're going to see a re-escalation, a continuation to the war," Butter said.

"It's going to be a long-term fight. You're going to see [the] regime strengthening, and you're going to see the opposition growing and becoming more active."

The US has been trying to help rebel groups in the south and east of Syria and in the north of Lebanon, but those efforts have been unsuccessful, according to Butter.

"A counter-terrorism strategy, which is what the Obama administration says is the purpose of their presence there, has been a failure," Butter said. "A counter-terrorism strategy is geared toward foreign fighters and foreign training, which doesn't get the job done."

The rebels are largely based in the northern part of the country, in the provinces of Idlib, al-Bab and Aleppo. The Assad regime also has a presence in the province of Latakia and the capital of Damascus.

Butter said the United States should focus on the south, where the rebels have the most effective fighting force, and where the Assad regime is weaker.

"The South is where the battle for Syria is being fought," Butter said. "We don't have the ability to go out there. We don't have the ability to train the rebels. We don't have the ability to give them air cover. We don't have the ability to send the dissidents there."

The rebels have already taken advantage of the US' withdrawal of its forces from Iraq.

"It's not the Iraqis who are winning the war in Syria," Butter said. "It's the Syrians. And they are winning because they are fighting on the ground, they are not fighting with the United States."

Russia and the US have been talking for months about a ceasefire. But Washington has been reluctant to provide direct military support to the rebels, with the argument that it would only hand over power to the regime.

At a meeting Wednesday between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Geneva, the two discussed the possibility of a deal on a cease-fire, but no agreement was reached.

The Obama administration has been trying for weeks to negotiate a broader cease-fire in Syria. But the talks have been difficult, as the US believes Assad and his Russian backers would see a US withdrawal from one area as a threat to their control of the whole country.

Butter said it wouldn't be a surprise if the US was asked again to help train the rebels, and he predicted the United States would do its best to provide training.

"The US is an excellent trainer," he said. "It's not going to be a quick process."<|endoftext|>It's a big news day in the gaming world.

Roof, who appeared to be a member of a church choir to which he regularly attended, was charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a firearm, among other charges.

Just after 1 p.m., one of the victims was identified as Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a state senator who was a relative of the slain pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney. Pinckney was among the nine people killed at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.

The Daily News, a New York-based newspaper, identified Roof as the killer.

The president's comments, and the White House's response to them, have caused a furor.

"I hate that this has happened in our country," Obama said. "This is a painful part of our history, and it has to be dealt with."

Some Democratic lawmakers have criticized the president's remarks.

"While we pray for the families of those killed in Charleston, it is deeply disturbing that the President of the United States would use this tragic event as a political platform," New York Rep. Gregory Meeks said.

"The President's comments today are a step in the wrong direction," Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings said in a statement. "We should not be politicizing a tragedy. The President should instead be focusing on the victims of this heinous crime."

Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia, a Republican, also criticized Obama's remarks.

"I'm very disappointed in the tone of the president's remarks today," Comstock said.

When asked at a press conference how he planned to respond to the shootings, Obama said, "I'm going to do everything I can to try to make sure that we never, ever have a repeat of this kind of mass violence."

In a speech at the White House on Friday, Obama said it's important for people to consider the context of the shooting.

"I want people to think about how they use social media. How they organize demonstrations. How they express their opinions," Obama said. "I want them to think about how they use their guns in the privacy of their own homes.

"That's not the country we know," he said. "And it's not the country we want to be."

Obama's comments followed a day of meetings with African-American leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who was among those killed at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama was not referring to the victims when he said the country "ought to consider" the context in which the shooting occurred.

"Those comments were not about the victims of the shooting. They were about the broader context of gun violence in this country," Earnest said.

Earnest said Obama intends to stay in Washington through the weekend, and he will be briefed on details of the police investigation.

In a separate interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday, Obama said the country is in need of "meaningful action." He said the Senate should pass a law to require background checks for gun sales.

"I want to move forward," Obama said. "I don't want to wait for the votes of Congress, but I do want to move forward. And I think that we can do that."

Obama said it was important that

Punch/hammer (to help push the cutting bits into the PVC)

I've noticed a few of the old shells came with a dremel bit at the front that I didn't use. I didn't have a dremel to hand so I used a small rubber mallet to pulverize the bit. That way I know I didn't accidentally slice a tooth off the end of the bit, or any other damage.

The rest of the info is on the original thread and linked here.


The whole blaster is pretty straight forward. The new shell is held on with two screws that go through the two halves. The second screw has a nut on it that goes through the shell where it meets the shell slide. The nut is held on by 3 small screws. The shell slide is held on by a thumbscrew, which has a hole punched in it. The shell slide is held on the shell by 4 screws. The shell slide is held on by 4 thumbscrews. The shell is held on by spring tension.


The spring tension is done by using two screws at the back end of the shell. It's a simple design that uses spring tension to support the shell. The spring tension is attached to the back of the shell by the small screws that go through the shell slide. The spring tension is the same as the spring tension in the shell mentioned above.

The spring tension on the new shell is 3.5 lbs.

 drill bits, all a different size.

PVC cutter, (aluminum, the kind that you use to cut out a door handle. You can use PVC, or anything else, I just used a tool I had laying around. You can also use a PVC cutter that's cut from 1/4" PVC that you cut with a hacksaw. You can also use a mason's line to drill holes in it, or a drill/cutter combo. I didn't use those for this project, since I wanted to be able to cut out the shell in a hurry. I couldn't find anything at the hardware store that would fit, and I didn't want to pay more than a few bucks for something that could be cut to size. I also didn't have any length of PVC to cut in 1/4" increments for this thing)

Punch and chisel and hammer (this one's for the holes in the shell, not to cut into it)

Jigsaw (You can also use a circular saw to cut the shells out, but I didn't want to waste a lot of time on it)

Pipe/punch to start the holes for the screws. I used #6x1/2" PVC pipe for the screws, because that's what I had on hand, but you can use whatever kind of PVC you have on hand, a bit of it all together and you'll have a pretty solid shell

Pipe/punch to finish the holes for the screws. You can use whatever kind of PVC you have on hand, a bit of it all together and you'll have a pretty solid shell


I also used a jigsaw to cut out the bracket for the hammer. I got a 4' piece of 1/4" PVC that I cut to a length that would fit into a 1/2" hole in the bottom of the shell, and I drilled 2 holes through that piece of PVC. I used a long paring knife to cut out the holes, and I used a piece of scrap 1/2" PVC to hold the hammer in place. It's a little tricky, but it works. You can see some of this in the picture.

The next item is the flame-retardant sealant. You can use whatever kind you want, but I used some PB-40. I don't know why, but it works extremely well. It's a little sticky, but it's not as bad as some other sealants people have suggested, and it's easy to apply. I would suggest applying it to the outside of the shell for now, however. It's less likely to get on the inside, where the blaster will be. It's easy to get on the inside of the shell, but it's not as easy to get off. I tried it once and it didn't work so well.

Bolt:

I used a 1.5" right angle bolt with a 1.5" open end to mount the 3/8" adapter to. I didn't use the standard 3/8" hex nut that came with the blaster to mount the adapter to the shell, I used an 1.5" hex nut that was cut to fit. I cut the hex nut to fit the blaster, then used some hot glue to secure it.

The hex nut that came with the blaster worked fine, but I don't think that's necessary for this blaster.

The hex nut I used was 3/8" long, 1/4" wide, and 1" tall. I used a 1/8" bit to cut the hex nut to 1.5" long, and a 3/8" bit to cut it to 1.5" wide.


Priming bar:

The priming bar I used is a 1/2" x 2" thick piece of PVC that's a little bit more pliable than the stock plastic priming block in the blaster. I cut the priming block to about 1/2" in length, and then made this piece to fit.

I used a piece of PVC pipe that was 1" long, and cut it with a hole saw. I used a 1/8" bit to cut the hole. As you can see here, the hole is 1" deep and 1/2" wide.


The plunger:

The plunger I used is a 2" long piece of PVC that's been cut down with a hole saw. I used a 1/8" bit to cut the hole.


The plunger was slightly bent, so I bent it back into shape with a dremel.


The hammer:

The hammer I used is a 1" thick piece of PVC that's been cut down with a hole saw. I used a 1/8" bit to cut the hole.


The hammer was slightly bent, so I bent it back into shape with a dremel.

The hammer and plunger were attached with a 1/8" bit to the plunger with a hot glue gun.


The plunger head is a little bit beat up, so I took a pick and drilled a hole to use as a catch.


The hammer was mounted to the plunger with a 1/8" bit. I used a 1/4" bit to drive the plunger into the hammer.


The dart trap:

I used a piece of 1/2" PVC pipe that was 2" long, and cut it to 1/2" in length. I cut the pipe to match the stock PVC, so it wouldn't interfere with the plunger.

I used a 1/8" drill bit to drill a hole to drive the dart trap into the PVC. I used a 1/4" drill bit to drill a hole to drive the dart trap into the PVC.


The dart trap worked great! You can see the dart catch in the upper left corner of the photo.

 drill bits if needed.<|endoftext|>"I've never seen this before" — the quote above, from the director of "Pitch Perfect" and "The Fault in Our Stars," is one that's been repeated over and over again.

But it's also one that almost never was.

"Pitch Perfect" was a stunning success. It did $170 million in its first weekend, becoming the highest-grossing independent film in history, and it had two sequels that were both equally successful. It had a star — Rebel Wilson — who was lauded for her acting and songwriting, and it had a franchise that was still continuing to grow.

"The Fault in Our Stars" was a much different story. It was a smash hit, earning $500 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing film directed by a woman. It had a lead actress — Shailene Woodley — who was hailed for her acting, and she had a leading role in a film about depression.

"Pitch Perfect 2" was released in February, and it was a huge success: $150 million in its first weekend, and it got a sequel in March.

But the big question was how it would do by year's end. At the time of its release, "Pitch Perfect 2" had earned $50 million in the U.S. and another $224 million worldwide.

And in the year since, it's made $200 million.

That's right: "Pitch Perfect 2" is the highest-grossing film by an independent studio.

I've seen it once, and in a theater filled with people who are fans of the original, it didn't feel like anything special. I didn't realize the potential for this movie, because I didn't realize how good it was. But it's a great film. And it's not just because it's an all-female cast. "I Love You, Man" by Corinne Bailey Rae is also amazing.

There's so much talent on the screen, and so much of it is doing what they do best.

"Pitch Perfect 2" is full of songs and performances that transcend the music. The performances by Wilson and Woodley are far more than just singing. They're taking the violin and making it into a corset, or turning it into a guitar, or making it a harp. They're letting it be whatever it wants to be, and then they're bringing their show to life.

The film also features a dazzling array of music and video. The film's music is equally impressive. The song "Ready for You" is the kind of upbeat song we rarely hear these days. The film's video for "Hey, Isn't It Romantic" is a fresh way of showing us a side of love we don't usually see. And the film's opening credits are a montage of clips from the film. It's a salute to everything that makes "Pitch Perfect" great.

And that's the thing: "Pitch Perfect 2" is every bit as good as "Pitch Perfect," as good as "The Fault in Our Stars," and as good as "Gravity."

There's a reason it's continuing to do so well.

"Pitch Perfect 2" is perfect and astonishingly good. It's not perfect, and it's not exceptionally good. But its flaws are all minor.

It's a good film.

And if you're a fan of indie movies, or indie music, or indie movies in general, or indie movies in general, this is a great time to be a fan.<|endoftext|>9 August, 2016. 00:00

Most standard analytical methods are appropriate for analyzing only one or two neurons at a time

There's nothing particularly magical about dimensionality reduction. It's a method devised to parse situations involving a very large number of variables (or dimensions) that something is subject to—a sound way of dealing with complexity that isn't also oversimplifying. Tasks like pattern or facial recognition are very difficult for computers because of the number of variables (high dimensionality) involved. As more and more data points are introduced into an algorithm, the processing power needed goes through the roof, as does statistical noise. And this is more or less the cutting edge of computing.

Dimensionality reduction algorithms operate under the premise that, underneath all of those dimensions, there is some sort of core process that can be derived that still does a good enough job of describing the more complex process. So, say that you, as a computer, had an image of a human face. There are a great many data points needed to describe that face (imagine a map of 3D coordinates) and, if you were to rotate that image, all of those data points would be changing too and soon enough, you would be very overwhelmed by information
==================== COMPLETION 113 ====================
. You could then, theoretically, try to characterize the face using a few variables at a time and, in the end, you'd probably get something that's close to the true face.

But that's not how we use computers. We don't try to map the face of the person on the screen to the face of the person in the photo. Instead, our computers use a technique called deep learning, which tries to mimic the way the brain processes information. Deep learning is particularly effective at processing images that contain a lot of data points. In fact, it's been used to scan the brains of people to understand the neural processes that underlie speech recognition.

That being said, most standard analytical methods are appropriate for analyzing only one or two neurons at a time. For example, an algorithm could use a subset of these data points to try to figure out what kind of information the neuron is sending out—which data points it needs to be more specific about, or which data points don't need to be correlated with each other. That requires a lot of computational power, and in the end, it's not really precise.

The problem is that, for every neuron, there are thousands of other neurons that are involved in its function. They are the neurons that make up the brain's neurons, and they send out all kinds of data that's not really relevant to the task at hand. For example, a neuron that is involved in a particular task can have many neurons that the software just can't understand. That's why, in the past century or so, we've been able to develop many different machine learning methods to try to crack the problem.

Importantly, the problem isn't just that deep learning algorithms cannot do a good enough job of describing what the neurons are doing. The problem is that deep learning algorithms cannot do a good enough job of describing what the neurons are doing.

A new approach to solving the problem

For the past few years, a new way of solving the problem has emerged. In their paper, the researchers describe a technique known as deep recurrent neural networks (DNNs). The DNNs were inspired by the way the brain processes information. These neural networks are based on a technique called backpropagation.

The idea is that, in the brain, information is processed in two different parts of the brain. The first part is the frontal lobe, which is responsible for thinking, problem solving, and reasoning. The second part is the parietal lobe, which is responsible for processing sensory information. When a neuron in the frontal lobe sends a signal out to one of the neurons in the parietal lobe, that signal gets processed by the other neurons in the parietal lobe. So, when you see a face, the neural network that processes that information will first send information to the frontal lobe, which takes on the inputs and maps them to the face. The second neural network will then take the information from the first neural network and map it to the face.

This structure is called a neural network, and it's really just a fancy way of saying that it consists of a bunch of neurons that are connected together. The type of connection between the neurons is called a synapse, and in a way, this is similar to how a computer works. Each computer has a processor, which is the central piece of hardware that all the other components (such as the memory, the graphics card, and the hard drive) use to process information.

In the brain, every neuron has a synapse with other neurons.

The way this works is that, in order to process information, the brain first connects neurons that are very close to one another. In other words, some neurons will have connections with neurons that they

==================== COMPLETION 114 ====================
.

As a first approximation, you might just use a lookup table. It's a bunch of data points (say, those data points that describe the face's eyes, nose and mouth) and they represent the face. If you know the data points of that face, you can then look up the name of a face, and if it's in that table, it's the same face.

But as you add more and more data to the lookup table, the job of the algorithm gets harder and harder. You can only have so many data points and, as you add more, your algorithm's ability to effectively describe the face improves, but it also gets more and more expensive to go through the table.

The problem is that this is changing so rapidly that your algorithm will need to be updated as the data is added. Because the algorithm is so at an analytical disadvantage, it's very difficult to get it to work.

DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS

As a way of addressing this problem, DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS is a method of reducing dimensions. Instead of a lookup table, it uses a matrix of dimensions (matrices of data points) that is the same size as the original image. Each row of the matrix represents one dimension, the columns represent the other dimensions. DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS is a very basic data reduction method that has been used to analyze photographs for years.

In addition to letting you analyze a lot of images without having to re-train the algorithm, DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS allows you to use a much smaller number of data points. With DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS, you can only analyze a few thousand data points per image, which results in much better efficiency (you save a lot of time) and much better accuracy at finding recognizable faces (because you don't have to calculate all the permutations of data points that each face can have).

So, how does it work?

We start with a program that has a function that looks up the information of a face in an image. The function is block-based (we'll talk about functions in a later article) and the program is called faceID. The program takes a face image and returns a list of face data points. The program then takes the first two columns and the first two rows of a matrix and divides those three data points by the number of dimensions in the image.

How much can we reduce dimensionality?

When we first saw the DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS in action, we were recently working with a database of 7.7 million images of people's faces. We had to analyze 2.5 billion of these images to get the data points necessary to analyze them. That's a lot of data points. Moreover, it wasn't even evenly distributed.

In a previous article, we showed that if you had a very large dataset, DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS would be able to find a lot of faces in that dataset. In fact, if you had a database of 1.7 billion faces, DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS would be able to find 3.5 billion faces.

But, as we kept analyzing more and more faces, it became quite clear that DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS would be unable to find any faces in the original dataset. There were just a lot of faces in the dataset and we needed to reduce the dimensionality of those faces in order to find one or two that were recognizable.

In the next article, we'll take a look at how DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS works when it comes to

==================== COMPLETION 115 ====================
. (If you were to look at the face in a mirror, you would notice that the shape of your head, the position of your eyes, the shape of your mouth, etc. all change, too.) So you adopt a framework in which you will only look at a small group of data points (of a certain type) at a time, and you will then figure out what those data points mean.

Most standard analytical methods are appropriate for analyzing only one or two neurons at a time—that is, they can only explain a small part of the complexity of the task at hand. But dimensionality reduction algorithms can take hundreds, thousands, or even millions of data points, and they will still do a good enough job of describing the underlying process. So, for instance, if you had this image of a face:

If you were to read this into a standard computer vision algorithm, you might get something like this:

You would be correct to say that the algorithm does indeed "see" the face, but it's not as clear as you might think that it is actually exhibiting the behavior of the face. As you probably know, computer vision algorithms aren't actually able to "see" anything, but they do use a lot of data points to describe the world they are manipulating, and it's possible that some of those data points are acting as "noise" (if you will) that must be removed before the algorithm can adequately describe the complicated matrix of data points.

But how can you tell if your algorithm is doing a good enough job of removing noise? If you were to look at the following image of the face from just before the noise was removed:

You would be able to see that the algorithm is now doing a pretty good job of "seeing" the face. After all, those data points are gone, and the model has now described the face in a way that is both accurate and good enough to explain the data points that remain.

This phenomenon is known as "feature extraction" and it can be used to help identify what features are actually being extracted in a given image. Using dimensionality reduction, you can take a large number of images (N) and find the subset of the data points that, for each image, are the most informative. If you find the subset of the data points that hold the most explanatory value for the image, you will know that the image has been correctly classified.

While the concept of feature extraction is a bit fuzzy, it's easy to see that it is a general tool that can be used to help classify images into one of several categories. The general consensus is that categories such as faces, faces with smiling expressions, gender, etc. are the most useful categories to look for in face recognition.

Feature extraction can also be used to identify objects in images. If you take the image below and zoom in to see the object that was captured by the camera:

You will see that the object in the picture is very small, but the feature extraction algorithm can tell that the object is there. In this case, the algorithm is more or less correctly identifying the object because the feature extraction algorithm correctly identified the object by taking the small feature that was captured by the camera.

Feature extraction is useful in image classification tasks because it is the most accurate way to identify objects in images. You can use the same algorithm to identify objects in images of faces, and the algorithm will be able to tell that the object is there.

The following image shows a face in a room. The algorithm can tell that the face is in the image because the features of the face are being captured by the camera. If you zoom in far enough to see the face, you can also see that there

Tasks like pattern or facial recognition are very difficult for computers because of the number of variables (high dimensionality) involved. As more and more data points are introduced into an algorithm, the processing power needed goes through the roof, as does statistical noise. And this is more or less the cutting edge of computing.

Dimensionality reduction algorithms operate under the premise that, underneath all of those dimensions, there is some sort of core process that can be derived that still does a good enough job of describing the more complex process. So, say that you, as a computer, had an image of a human face. There are a great many data points needed to describe that face (imagine a map of 3D coordinates) and, if you were to rotate that image, all of those data points would be changing too and soon enough, you would be very overwhelmed by information
==================== COMPLETION 116 ====================
. You would need a method that could slice the face into manageable chunks.

So, an algorithm that could slice a face into manageable chunks would need to perform a number of operations and take that data back out again to generate a new, similar face. The more data points you had, the more things you could do, but the complexity of the task increases exponentially as the number of dimensions increases. The more data points you have, the more complicated the task becomes.

The goal of dimensionality reduction is to reduce the complexity of the task so that a computer can perform it (and this is what the researchers did). But the researchers point out that most standard analytical methods are appropriate for analyzing only one or two neurons at a time. In other words, you need a number of observations that the algorithm can take into account and use to infer complexity. The researchers took this to the extreme by manipulating the number of neurons in the brain.

"As we increase the number of neurons, we need to make a decision about which dimensionality reduction algorithm to use. We can either choose one that is available today or we can design our own using the techniques we have learned from the brain," says Shuguang Li, lead author of the paper.

This is a pretty bold example of how we are now able to manipulate the brain in order to better understand and manipulate it.

Using the computational techniques they discovered in the brain, the researchers developed a method to figure out how neurons compute the complexity of the task. In other words, they found a way to understand how neurons store information about the information they are processing.

"We are seeing the first computational brain," says Li. "We are transforming the brain into a computer by analyzing its computational capabilities—making it a computer in the brain. This is a pretty bold example of how we are now able to manipulate the brain in order to better understand and manipulate it."

But that's not all.

While the computational brain is a lot more powerful, the researchers are also finding that brains are surprisingly capable of using much less than we would expect.

"We have demonstrated that the computational brain is not limited to handling a very small number of variables. In fact, the computational brain can handle a lot of variables with very little computation," says Li.

This is one of the largest-ever studies of the computational brain in the field of neuroscience. In fact, it's so large that it has been published in a journal that doesn't seem to be very popular in the scientific community.

"The computational brain is much larger than conventional computational models of the brain commonly applied in neuroscience," says Li. "Our experiment is a demonstration that the computational brain can handle a very large number of variables."

They even found that neurons can perform simple functions without the requirement of being able to compute them. This is just like the human brain.

"We found that neurons can perform quite simple tasks without needing to compute the functions that they perform," says Li. "We have shown this in our experiments."

So, the computational brain is not limited to handling a very small number of variables. In fact, the computational brain can handle a lot of variables with very little computation.

As far as the research goes, the researchers are now looking to expand their research to other neural networks and artificial intelligence systems.

"Our research is aimed at understanding how the brain and other living systems have evolved and what are the limits of computation," says Li. "We are completely open to collaborating with other scientists to build computers that will help us build more complex artificial intelligence systems."

And that is precisely what we have been trying to do for years.<|endoftext|>A.N.A.N.

Then there are the isoflavones, which are weak phytoestrogens (estrogen-like compounds found in plants). Isoflavone levels vary in different types of tofu and soy milk products. Your body's estrogen is much, much stronger than the estrogen-like isoflavones in soy. So if the weak soy substance replaces the natural high-strength estrogen in cells, then maybe the soy will protect against cancers that would prefer a stronger estrogen signal.

Soy is often promoted as a healthy protein alternative for people who would rather not eat meat. Research about the effects of soy on cancer risk reduction has been mixed. Much of it has come from observing population groups such as the Japanese, who eat much more soy and begin eating it at a much younger age than people in Western countries.

In fact, the average woman living in East Asia eats about 10 times the quantity of soy foods as the average woman in the United States. Yet East Asian women have lower rates of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer than women in the United States.

The "soy
==================== COMPLETION 117 ====================
 paradox"

But even if you don't eat soy, you might want to consider it because it is so widely used. Between 1992 and 2006, soybean production in the United States increased by about 41 percent.

That's a lot of soybeans. But soybeans are not the only food that has been genetically modified. Some corn and soybeans are modified to contain insect-resistant genes. The corn and soybean genes are "stacked" together.

And because these insect-resistant genes are placed in the same place in the corn or soybean plant, they don't have to run around and cross-pollinate to get their genes into the next generation. In other words, these corn or soybean genes don't have to cross-pollinate with someone else's corn or soybean genes to get their genes into the next generation.

So if you eat soy products, you're getting some of these insect-resistant genes. And you could get a lot more if you eat soybeans that are genetically engineered to be insect-resistant.

That's the "soy paradox" that you might want to think about.

What about the soybean protein?

There's another factor in soy that might be affecting cancer risk. That factor is soy protein.

Soy protein is a very high-quality protein. So much so, in fact, that it's often used to supplement animal protein. In fact, a soy protein-rich product, soy protein concentrate, is advertised as the protein substitute for the vegan diet.

But soy protein is not the only food that contains soy protein. Many people consume soy protein products as well.

And that's why I'm interested in this new study that looked at the soy protein in soy milk.

Contrary to what you might expect, the soy milk contained very little soy protein. What's more, the soy protein in the milk was virtually invisible.

When researchers compared the soy milk with other soy products that contained soy protein, they found that the soy protein in soy milk was not even detectable. There was no soy protein in the soy milk.

So how did this happen?

The scientists looked at the different types of soy protein that are present in soy milk. They discovered that the most abundant type of soy protein found in soy milk is not the type that people drink.

It's something called soy lecithin. This is a soy protein that's usually extracted from soybeans. It's not present in soy milk.

The soy lecithin is a very important component of the soy protein in soy milk. So when researchers compared the soy lecithin to other soy proteins, they found that soy lecithin was not only much less abundant than these other soy proteins, but it was not even detectable.

So how did the soy lecithin get into soy milk?

The scientists think that soy lecithin may have been added to soy milk because soy milk contains a soybean oil derivative, which is also a very good source of lecithin. When soy lecithin is extracted from the beans, it's turned into soy oil.

But the soy lecithin that's extracted from soybeans is not the same as the soy lecithin that's naturally present in soybeans.

So when researchers compared the soy lecithin to the soybean lecithin in soy milk, they found that the soy lecithin was not even present in soy milk.

The soy lecithin in soy milk was not soy lecithin, but it was soybean lecithin.

In fact, the average woman living in East Asia eats about 10 times the quantity of soy foods as the average woman in the United States. Yet East Asian women have lower rates of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer than women in the United States.

The "soy
==================== COMPLETION 118 ====================
 hypothesis" says that soy consumption in East Asia protects against breast cancer. However, since so many Asian women also eat a lot of red meat, the chance that soy affects breast cancer risk is less than that of red meat.

In a recent review of soy's effects on breast cancer risk, researchers looked at studies that examined the effects of soy intake on women in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and China. They concluded that soy does not appear to reduce the risk of breast cancer, even for Asian women.

In fact, a study published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention reports that Asian women who consume a lot of soy have higher breast cancer risk than other Asian women.

The American Cancer Society's policy statement on soy says that it is not advisable to eat soy products in amounts exceeding about 10 to 20 per cent of total calories, or about 3 to 5 servings daily.

Of course, soy foods have their advantages. They're convenient, easy to prepare, and don't have to be refrigerated. But when you choose soy foods in moderation, you can avoid some of the risk factors for breast cancer.

Dairy products and soy

Dairy products are also an important source of protein and essential fatty acids. Soy milk, as well as tofu, contains the same protein and essential fatty acids as cow's milk. Soy milk contains about 20 grams of protein per serving.

Soy isoflavones are not absorbed in the small intestine, but they do reach the large intestine where they bind to estrogen receptors in breast tissue. Some studies suggest that soy isoflavones may protect against breast cancer.

But the soy isoflavones in soy have a half-life of only 36 hours, so the amount of isoflavones you get from soy milk is only a tiny fraction of the isoflavones you would have absorbed from eating soy foods. So you may be getting too much soy isoflavones from soy milk to have a beneficial effect.

Pregnant and breast-feeding women

In addition to the risks and benefits for adults, pregnant and breast-feeding women should also be cautious of soy, since so many soy products are fortified with estrogen.

In fact, the Canadian Pregnancy Association says that soy products should not be consumed by pregnant and breast-feeding women, since it can be harmful to their health. Soy products should be avoided during pregnancy.

In general, Americans are eating about 25 grams of soy per day, which is about twice as much as the recommended amount. Soy foods may be tempting, but please don't eat too much.

Soy isoflavones

Soy foods contain isoflavones, the naturally occurring isoflavones found in soybeans. There are more than 200 types of isoflavones.

The soy isoflavones in soy foods are non-essential. So it's possible to get enough isoflavones from soy if you choose foods that are high in other nutrients, such as calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K.

Soy isoflavones are also estrogenic, meaning they can stimulate the production of estrogen in the body.

In general, people are encouraged to eat foods that are high in all the major nutrients, including calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K, rather than single nutrients, such as isoflavones.

What is soy isoflavones?

The soy isoflavones, or genistein and daidzein, are the isoflavones found in soy beans. Genistein is a strong isoflavone, while daidzein is weaker. Genistein

The "soy

-free" label is a marketing ploy to make soy seem like a healthy alternative to meat. The label is technically correct, but it's an unfair, misleading label that makes it more difficult for consumers to make the health decisions they need to make.

The best way to avoid soy is to eat a wide variety of foods that naturally contain many of the phytoestrogens and isoflavones that soy contains.

Letting soy grow unchecked may have adverse health consequences for years to come.

Malek al-Nimr, one of the few known activists in Saudi Arabia to speak out against what they see as the kingdom's repressive policies, was arrested in August 2011 along with other activists, including a cleric, for similar offences.

In a case that has drawn global attention, al-Nimr was convicted of "insulting Islam" for tweeting a picture of a young girl with a sign saying: "There is no god but God, and Mohammed is his messenger" - an offence punishable by death in Islamic law.

He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes, 10 times the punishment for adulterers, for his Twitter comment.

After his conviction, al-Nimr told Reuters that he would appeal the sentence.

"If you have to have a death sentence, then I would have been happy to die on my feet," he said. "That's how I would have accepted it."

In a separate case in the eastern province of Qatif, another activist, Abdullah al-Hamid, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 600 lashes on Monday, according to his lawyer.

Al-Hamid was arrested in 2012 for allegedly insulting Islam. Under Saudi law, the maximum sentence for any crime is death.

They've been a mediocre team in recent years, but have managed to claw their way back into contention in the playoffs.

The "soy
==================== COMPLETION 120 ====================
 cancer" hypothesis has been challenged by more recent research. A small study of 60 breast cancer survivors who ate very little soy food between the ages of 50-65 found no correlation between soy consumption and breast cancer risk either.

A review of studies (by Dr. Richard Besser) published in the July Issue of the journal Nutr Cancer found that breast cancer risk increased with the amount of soy intake, but did not increase with the type of soy. (Note: I have been unable to locate the original article; it is no longer online.) The review also found that breast cancer risk was not influenced by soy consumption in women who were taking hormone replacement therapy.

But if you consume Soylent daily, I can't imagine what harm you might be doing to your health.

So soy is a healthy food source for a vegan?

The truth is, it's difficult to see what harm you might be doing to your health by consuming soy protein.

Soy isoflavones are not nearly as potent as estrogen. The soy protein isoflavones, like estrogen, have a much lower potency than estrogen in regulating the body. Soy protein is also about 10 times more effective than estrogen in stimulating the growth of breast tissue.

But where soy protein does seem to be a health risk is in situations where the body needs to convert it to estrogen. This conversion process is called isoflavone acylation. It's the process by which soy proteins are converted to estrogen in the body.

The conversion of soy protein to estrogen is another reason why soy is a good source of phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogens, like soy isoflavones, have a very weak estrogen-like effect in the body. So if the soy protein is converted to estrogen, then it can potentially cause estrogen problems in some people.

If you consume soy protein containing isoflavones, then you are avoiding your body's natural estrogen signal. Since so many of your cells need to convert soy protein to estrogen, a vegetarian diet that excludes soy is probably best for you.

But if you are a veggie-eating omnivore, then a vegetarian diet that includes soy is probably best for you.

Soy isoflavones are found in soyfoods and soy milk products. Soy isoflavones are also found in tofu, tempeh, miso, ground flaxseed, and in soy milk.

They are in soy protein isolate, soy protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, and soy protein isolate with calcium. They can also be found in milk. Soy isoflavones are also found in "plant-based" milks.

Soy isoflavones can be found in plant foods such as tofu, tempeh, miso, ground flaxseed, and in plant-based milks.

These proteins are also present in many plant foods, such as soybeans, which are not commonly consumed as a vegetable.

But I'm not a vegetarian!

I'm sorry, but vegetarians have a bigger advantage in this case than vegans do.

Soy protein isolate, soy protein concentrate, soy protein isolate with calcium, soy protein isolate with magnesium, soy protein isolate with iron, and soy protein isolate with phytoestrogens are all plant foods. They aren't consumed as a vegetable.

So, you may be eating a variety of foods that aren't vegetarian.

And if you eat a large variety of foods, then you are more likely to consume the nutrients your body needs.

The bottom line is that vegetarians get most of their protein from plant sources. Vegans have to eat many more plant

 without regard to the consequences of such actions. The Fascist state is a standing army, an armament industry and a private police. The "Collectivists" of the Left, who are the offspring of the liberal school of thought in Italy, are the heirs of an ideal which is not the product of a long and arduous struggle, but of a series of jumps and leaps. They do not know what Fascism is; for them Fascism is the natural order of things. They are the heirs of the liberal economists who preached the principle of "privatization" and "solidarity" while they began by expropriating the land and the means of production, and then, in spite of all that, they began to think of the State as the most natural agent for organizing exchange and distribution. The Fascist state is a war-machine. It is a government which uses violence and blows at others in order to get its way. The Fascist state is a war- machine which, from the very beginning, has been established by force and violence. It is an apparatus which is so thoroughly militaristic that, apart from the military police and the police, it is incapable of accommodating itself to the needs of the industrial proletariat. It is an apparatus which, as soon as it has acquired the arbitrary power to affect the course of events, has used it to subdue the nation. 2. The Fascist state is a monopoly of violence. It is a state in which the state, instead of the individual, is the individual. It is a state in which the State is the sole guardian of life, the sole sustainer of the family and the sole guarantor against the perversion of virtue. It is a state in which the State is the only origin of morality and law; it is a state in which the State is the only arbiter of the true and the good. It is a state in which the State is the only owner of the land and the only proprietor of the means of production, the sole master of the national education, and the sole master of the national art and of the national literature. It is a state which is so rigidly moral that the State (which is, indeed, the one and only owner of life) is not only incapable of maintaining virtue, but is actually impelled to promote it. It is a state in which the only morality is the morality of the State. It is a state where the State, instead of being the agent of justice, has become the master of justice, and between the State and the individual any action is possible which it has the right to take. It is a state which would impose upon the individual a morality which it itself had created. It is a state in which the State is the master of the state, the sole proprietor of the state, and the sole ruler of the State. It is a state in which the State is the only judge of the person, and in which the State is the only judge of the justice of the State. 3. The Fascist state is an apparatus of terror. It is a society in which violence is the way of life. It is a society in which the way of life is the way of death. Not only is the State the master of the individual, but the State is the master of all. It is the state in which the individual is the slave of the State, an instrument of the State, a mere instrument of the State. It is a state in which, in order to maintain life, the State has to kill. It is a state in which the State is the only law of the individual, a state in which the State is the sole judge of the life of the individual.

 with all the powers of the world. All the more is this the case in the sphere of foreign trade, since the whole point is to bring the foreign world under the heel of the Italian state. In the sphere of war the Fascisti are guided by the words of Mussolini: "I do not know of a more effective weapon than war. I do not know of a more difficult weapon than war. I do not know of a more effective weapon than war. I do not know of a more difficult weapon than war." 4* Mein Kampf, Chapter 3. The Fascist State is not a mere instrument of the state. It is a state of mind, a belief in the inevitability of a new order, and a will to power in the world. The elites have to be brought into line with the new order, and the Fascisti are the vanguard of the movement. In the Fascist state all classes and strata are expected to become one. The mass of the people is to become one with the State. The State is to become the only true "people" — a people of a new order. This is the Fascist idea of the State. The two Fascist lawgivers — the Party and the State — are fundamentally identical. Both are instruments of the State. Both are inimical to the masses. Both are out to enslave the people. Both are ruthless and tyrannical. Both are intolerant. Both are anti-intellectual. Both are anti-modern. Both are anti-feminine. Both are anti-socialist. Both are anti-proletarian. Both are anti-peace. Both are anti-individualist. Both are anti-rational. Both are intolerant of heterodoxy, of open dissent. Both are intolerant of the universal. Both are intolerant of relativism. Both are intolerant of atheism. Both are intolerant of humanism. Both are intolerant of all that is non-Fascist. 4* The plan of the Fascist State is defined in the Fascist Manifesto as "the reconstitution of a whole new human personality, based on the collaboration of all the people and in conformity with the destiny of the people. The new personality, which is to be built up, through the reconstitution of the State, of the whole Italian people, is based on the principle: that the State is the people." (Fascisti ed., p. xxxii.) The Fascist Party is a political organ of the Fascist State. It is a body which implements the Fascist plan. Its power springs from the fact that it has been able to unite the Fascisti. It is the instrument of the Fascist State. If the Fascists were to be overthrown, it would be because they had been made to look like tyrants, because the masses had forgotten their place and had ceased to be the "people" of whom Mussolini spoke. 5 THE FASCISTA THE FASCISTA STATE THE FASCIST STATE is an idea. It is a belief in a new order, a conviction that there is a better way of doing things, that the good things of past ages are to be brought back, that the past is still in our power to learn, that the past is still an adequate guide to the future. It is a belief in the inevitability of a new order. The Fascist State is a belief in the inevitable, in the absolute necessity of a new order. It is a belief in the future, in the future of a new order, a future in which the past will become as it was and the future will take its place. It is a belief in the inevitable.

 and broken without notice. The Fascist state is a preventive, not an aggressor, state. Its enemies are identified with its neighbours and its allies are identified with its own. The enemy, in Fascist parlance, is the "internal enemy" with whom the Fascist state must do all in its power to assimilate and make loyal. The internal enemy is the "enemies within" who have to be subjugated in a Fascist state. The internal enemy is a class whose members have become "un-American" in the eyes of the Fascist state. The enemy within is a certain "hostility" towards the Fascist state which must be constantly frustrated. The internal enemy is one of the "ideology of the herd," which will have to be converted into "ideology of the State" and which must be turned into "ideology of the Party." Admitting the Fascist state to the ranks of the "international community" is merely the first step in the conversion of the "ideology of the herd" into "ideology of the State." The Fascist state has no enemies. It may fight in a great war against a foreign enemy. It may even fight for its own existence. But, while it fights, it does not wish to be a conquering power. It wishes to be the master of its own fate, to determine its own destiny. Its enemies are not to be feared. They are not the peoples of the world who are to be dismembered by the sword. They are the enemies of the Fascist state, among whom it is to be exterminated. The Fascist state is an organism, a living organism, which must be preserved and protected at all costs. It is therefore possible to foresee that the Fascist state that is formed following the defeat of Fascism will, at first, be a weak, ineffective and temporary state. The Fascist state is a political organism. It is an organism which is therefore liable to contact and injury. There will be many periods of decline and decline. The victory of Fascism will be followed by a period of rejuvenation, a period of ascendancy, a period when Fascism will prevail and Fascist institutions will become dominant. If the Fascist state shall be weak, it will have to be strengthened and strengthened again and again. The Fascist state will be constantly called upon to attack, to fight and to destroy its enemies, to annihilate them and to conquer. It will be constantly and continuously harassed by its enemies and, at times, by its own allies. The Fascist state will not only survive, it will be strengthened. It will be rescued from time to time from the hands of its enemies and, in spite of them, it will be able to defend itself by its own power. The Fascist state will be able to stretch out its hands and to restore itself. It will be able to reverse the situation, to regain its confidence, to recover its courage. The Fascist state will be able to undertake certain projects which would have been impossible to undertake under any other circumstances. It will be able to renew its strength, to recapture lost territories and it will be able to restore its international prestige. Its resources will be able to be used for the maintenance of internal order, for the organization of its armies and for the establishment of Fascist economic policies. The Fascist state will be able to achieve a certain measure of stability and tranquillity. It will have to restore its prestige, to regain its lost territories and to regain its er- ror. It will have to restore its military leaders and to reorganize them into a permanent organization. But, if the Fascist state is strongly founded, if it is able to survive, it will still have to do other things. It will

, treaties are signed and broken, concessions are granted, obligations are carried out, and, in short, every kind of action which can be classified as Machiavellian is practised. Through its special agencies, the State undertakes to make all men feel that they are the masters of the world and must not look upon the world as a poor, dis- served little creature. This idea is the starting-point of every Fascist policy. The Fascist State is omnipotent, because it is unrestrained and arbitrary. It is omnipresent because it is everywhere. It is everywhere because it is the power which imposes itself upon the world. It is everywhere because it is the soul of the world and the soul of the world is more powerful than the body. All the nations and all the races, ranging from the most primitive to the most cultured, are to be conquered. Any nation that does not submit to the will of the State is a rival, a sapient being, a foreigner. The Fascist doctrine is universal. It is no longer a doctrine for a particular class of people, but for all men. It is not a doctrine to be imposed upon peoples, but to be accepted and accepted only by the people. Every nation may refuse to accept it, but must accept the Government that is imposed upon it. The Fascist doctrine is the doctrine of the State. It is the doctrine of the State which says: "For us and our heirs, the State shall be omnipotent; for us and our heirs, the State shall be omnipotent." The Fascist doctrine is the doctrine of the State. It is the doctrine of the State which says: "For us and our heirs, the State shall be omnipotent; for us and our heirs, the State shall be omnipotent."

The Fascist doctrine is a doctrine which can be accepted by peoples only if it is accepted by them. It is the doctrine which, once accepted, can be retained only by the peoples who accept it.

Let's start with an example of our C++ code.

void main(void) { int x, y; vector<int> a; for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) { for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(x); } for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) { for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(y); } for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) { for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(x); } for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) { for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(y); } vector<int> b; for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) { for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) b.push_back(x); } for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) { for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) b.push_back(y); } b.push_back(x); for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) { for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) b.push_back(y); } b.push_back(x); }

Now, let's define a new vector object called a for sorting purposes.

vector<int> a;

Now, let's load the data from string and sort it using Radix Sort.

for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) a.push_back(y); for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(x); for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) a.push_back(y); for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(x); for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) a.push_back(y); for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(x); for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) a.push_back(y); for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(x); for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) a.push_back(y); for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(x); for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) a.push_back(y); for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(x); for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) a.push_back(y); for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(x); for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) a.push_back(y); for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(x); for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) a.push_back(y); for (x = 1; x < 100; x++) a.push_back(x); for (y = 1; y < 10; y++) a.push_back(y); for (x = 1; x < 100; x

==================== COMPLETION 135 ====================
ms by Chen, et al. Let's use Radix Sort.

Let's assume that we need to sort the characters in a string. We can use the radix sort algorithm to achieve this task. Let's define the algorithm:

void sort(const std::vector<std::string>& characters) { for (size_t n = 0; n < characters.size(); ++n) { if (eof(characters[n])) { ++characters[n]; } else { count_characters(characters[n]); } } }

The implementation of the algorithm is very simple. It iterates through the characters and checks if the characters are null-terminated or not. If it is not, it will count the number of characters in the string.

If the second condition is true, then it will sort the characters in the reverse order.

Here is an example:

characters = "This is a test"; vector<char> sorted = characters.sort();

Here is the output:

This is a test This is a test This is a test This is a test

The most interesting part of the algorithm is the second function, count_characters. It takes a vector of characters and returns the number of characters in the vector. The algorithm is simple and can be understood very easily. It takes a vector and returns the same vector, but since it takes the second argument as a function, count_characters can do different things depending on the input vector.

The following program implements the algorithm.

#include <iostream> #include <vector> template<class T> void sort(const std::vector<T>& characters) { for (size_t n = 0; n < characters.size(); ++n) { if (eof(characters[n])) { ++characters[n]; } else { count_characters(characters[n]); } } } void count_characters(const std::vector<char>& characters) { std::cout << "characters: " << std::endl; for (size_t c = 0; c < characters.size(); ++c) { if (c == characters[c]) { std::cout << " " << c; } } }

The output is:

characters: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 characters: This is a test This is a test This is a test This is a test This is a test

In the following program, we see how a Radix Sort implementation can be used to represent a sorted vector.

#include <iostream> #include <vector> template<class T> void sort(const std::vector<T>& characters) { for (size_t n = 0; n < characters.size(); ++n) { if (eof(characters[n])) { ++characters[n]; } else { sort(characters[n]); } } } void sort(const std::vector<char>& characters, std::vector<char>& sorted) { for (size_t c = 0; c < characters.size(); ++c) { if (c == characters[c]) { sorted.push_back(characters[c]); } } } void sort(const std::vector<char>& characters, std::vector<char>& sorted, T key) { for (size_t c = 0; c < characters.size(); ++c) { if (c == sorted[c]) { sorted.push_back(characters[c

 In fact, the United States stands on the cusp of a dramatic revival and rejuvenation, propelled by an amazing wave of technological innovation. A slew of breakthroughs will deliver the enormous productivity gains and the societal dramatic cost savings needed to sustain economic growth and prosperity. These breakthroughs, mostly digital in nature, will complete the shift begun by the Internet away to a new era where the precepts of Moore's Law can be applied to virtually any field.

Computer-assisted design and fabrication will reshape manufacturing forever. These technologies will slash waste and replace nearly all conventional manufacturing with more environmentally friendly and cost-effective additive manufacturing run with robots and computer programs. Complex systems resistant to modeling will succumb to advances in big data that allow mankind to finally make sense and improve upon the most intricate multi-faceted interactions. Where big data fails, ubiquitous crowd sourcing will harness untapped brain cycles to train systems and solve problems, one small activity at a time — on a global scale.

In this massively digital world, A/B testing or parallelization of R&D processes will become commonplace for just about everything from airline design simulations to online advertising to artificial organ construction.

cheap, low-cost, non-computer-based fabrication methods will become ubiquitous. Although only a few companies have embraced this new technology, it will enormously transform the way we design, manufacture, and test products.

The Internet of Things will continue to change how we do business and how we do life. The increased participation of everyday objects in our lives, data generated by phones, TVs, thermostats, and the like will exponentially increase the social and economic impact of the IoT. Today, companies like Google and Apple are making it cheap and easy for anyone to participate in the IoT; for example, by embedding sensors and operating systems in the products we buy. As more stuff moves online, society will dynamically move from a world of passive consumption to a world of active participation.

Similarly, the Internet of Everything will become the gigabit-per-second Internet of Everything. This will allow for a far more frictionless, global, and efficient connection between everything on the planet. Computers will be everywhere — and they will be intelligent, aware, and capable of intelligent, aware and capable activities. The Internet of Everything will become the Internet of Everything, because it will be the Internet of Everything.

Mankind will seamlessly integrate the Internet of Everything into our daily lives. Unlike today, we will be able to instantly share anything we want, anywhere and anytime with anyone we want — or even with the wrong people.

A new era of digital and physical innovation is coming. The world is moving rapidly toward a future where accelerating technological advances will transform every aspect of our lives. The big question is, will we be ready?

Brin/Wikimedia Commons<|endoftext|>In my previous post, I explained a few reasons why I think there are some things that I love in the Calvin and Hobbes universe, and why I think it will be a fun experience for my 5-year-old son to read. I promised that if I could make the Calvin and Hobbes universe my own, I would have a fun read at the same time. Here is what I came up with!

1. It's a universe with more mysterious characters.

Calvin and Hobbes was one of the first graphic novels. It was published in 1989, and it's already a classic. The story is about a little boy and his dog, and it is like a rags to riches story. The main characters are painfully shy and socially awkward. They are not the typical rich, pathetic, and arrogant characters that are so common in the world of comics. Calvin was left at the doorstep of a homeless shelter, and Hobbes is just a stray cat.

The world of Calvin and Hobbes is full of characters that the reader never sees, but which are just as mysterious and mysterious as the boy and his dog. We never see how Calvin's dad died, or how he met his mother. We don't know where the tiger really came from, or where he's hiding under the bed. We don't know if the tiger is actually a dog or a cat. We don't know how to pronounce the word "poodle." We don't know what the tiger's name is. We don't know if the tiger and the dog are friends, or enemies. We don't know who the boy's mom is.

The world of Calvin and Hobbes is full of mystery, and it's exciting to see what I will be able to uncover.

2. It's a world with more than one setting.

Calvin and Hobbes is set in a world full of different cultures and cultural groups. The book is set in a world where the only things that people wear are pants, and they dress in a way that says

cheap computing power integrated into mobile devices will allow for the same kind of rapid prototyping that allowed the iPhone to become a world-changing product. New computing machines and software that enable these kinds of innovations will be available for a very low cost. Where the latest and greatest technology is concerned, you can be sure that we will all lose our jobs, but we won't actually lose our jobs because of it.

More and more, the world will be built by machines, automated and not by humans:

The next great computer science breakthroughs will allow computers to understand, analyze, and make sense of the world around them. These breakthroughs will enable computers to perform in ways that human brains cannot.

These breakthroughs will enable computers to perform in ways that human brains cannot. More and more, the world will be built by machines, not by humans. Computers will be integrated into every aspect of society, making human labor obsolete. The creation of robots will become a common sight in the next several decades.

The creation of robots will become a common sight in the next several decades. More and more, the world will be built by machines, not by humans.

It is difficult to predict where the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence, machine learning, or machine learning technology will come from, but I believe the most likely place it will come from is the Internet. If we can train computers to understand, analyze, and make sense of the world around them, computers will have a much better chance of becoming smarter than humans.

From the standpoint of the future, the future is already here. The technology that is currently under development has already started to change the world. The next big computing breakthrough will be the one that will make the world a better place.

The next big computing breakthrough will be the one that will make the world a better place.

Are you ready for the near future?

The following is my personal view of where the next computing breakthroughs will come from. I invite you to add your own predictions to the comments section below.

Computer Science

The next big computing breakthrough will be the one that will make the world a better place.

The Internet of Things

The next big computing breakthrough will be the one that will make the world a better place.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a trend in computer science that is based on the concept of "things": any type of physical entity that can be connected to the Internet, such as a refrigerator, a car, a lamp, a thermostat, etc. This concept has become increasingly popular in recent years, due to its ability to connect disparate devices into a network, to monitor their health, and to communicate with each other. The IoT is currently being used in a variety of applications, including the automotive industry, where sensors and actuators are being embedded into vehicles.

Computer-assisted design

The next big computing breakthrough will be the one that will make the world a better place.

Computer-assisted design (CAD) is a process by which computer-driven designs can be created using a variety of software tools, including AutoCAD, Rhino, and SketchUp. CAD is currently used in the automotive industry to design and build the body of cars, and in other industries, such as manufacturing and construction, where physical prototypes are needed. Computer-assisted design will enable the development of millions of robots and other machine learning devices, which will enable the creation of smarter, safer, more efficient, and more efficient manufacturing processes.

Machine learning

The next big computing breakthrough will be the one that will make the world a better place.

Machine learning is the process by which computer programs learn

cheap computers will revolutionize the training of new engineers, and dramatically lower costs of training in all areas. In the same way that the Internet revolutionized education, it will revolutionize higher education.

In the absence of government subsidies or mandates, basic research will increasingly be self-sustaining. Instead of government investment in basic research, private sector investment will drive the innovation economy. Universities will become vast repositories of knowledge, where all discoveries can be quickly scrutinized and shared across the globe.

The pace of technological innovation will accelerate dramatically as a result of the rapid shift from a static economy to a dynamic one. This shift will provide the basis for the largest economic boom in human history. The robust, enduring growth of the digital economy will generate trillions in additional wealth for the human race, creating a new global economic order that will scale forever.

This is a book about the future of the American economy. It is an exhilarating story of a nation that is building the foundations of a new future. It is a tale of not only the power of innovation but the power of inspiration and the power of a new vision that is so far beyond the confines of our historical experience.

It is a new chapter in the life of the country that proudly was founded on a vision of liberty and opportunity. It is a story about a new vision of the future.

It is a story about an American economy that is at the heart of the world's greatest industrial power. It is a story about the hope of the future and the power of a new vision that is so far beyond the confines of our historical experience.

And it is a story about a new generation of American workers who are not just giving back to their communities but are redefining the American dream.

This book is the story of innovation and the power of innovation. It is the story of the next century — the story of the future.

Libya's oil production has been declining since the start of the year, meaning that Libya's production is now less than half of what it was at the start of the year.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that Libya's oil production will fall by more than half in the next few months as the country's oil infrastructure is targeted by ISIS-allied militants.

ISIS has been a relative newcomer to Libya. The group was formed in the August 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar al-Qaddafi and has been active in the country since. The United States and its allies have been trying to train and arm moderate rebels, but they have not been able to forge a broad-based political coalition that can win the support of the country's diverse factions.

The United States has also been fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which has claimed responsibility for a spate of attacks on western targets, including the June 2 attack on a French satirical magazine that killed 12 people.<|endoftext|>The final frontier is here.

The first lady of the United States is a mother of three and a grandmother of five, and she's on a mission to provide some much-needed balance to our nation's busy lives.

Michelle Obama has announced a new initiative aimed at promoting healthy eating in America. The First Lady is calling it "Let's Move."

In the official press release announcing the new initiative, the First Lady said, "America's food system is broken. Too many Americans aren't getting the healthy choices they need, and we're doing too little to help."

The First Lady is calling on Americans to take part in the initiative by helping them set up healthy eating plans and participating in their daily routines.

Thank you @BarackObama for your leadership and commitment to #Let'sMove! — Michelle Obama (@FLOTUS) April 19, 2016

According to Michelle Obama, "It's time for Americans to step up and take charge of their health to build a healthier America, one meal at a time."

The First Lady said that she is hoping the initiative will inspire more Americans to get up and move around and help them make healthier choices at every stage of life.

"It's time to move out of the house and try something new," said Michelle Obama. "You don't have to look far to find a new activity that makes you feel good. You don't have to look far to find healthy foods that taste great. You don't have to look far to find fresh fruits and vegetables that are packed with vitamins and minerals and fiber. I want all Americans to start experimenting and making their own healthy choices, and then share what they learn with their friends and families."

The First Lady said that people have the power to make a difference in their own lives and that they can take action and help others make healthy choices in their own lives.

 market is by boat.

Libya's oil exports were down by more than half in 2015, according to the International Energy Agency. Libya's oil production was down by more than a quarter from 2012 to 2014.

"Libya's production has been falling since the fall of Qaddafi," said Leonid V. Chikov of the International Crisis Group in a note this week. "Most of the country's oil exports are destined for Turkey and the Gulf, and the country's only export terminal at Es Sider has been closed for months."

Libya's oil industry is largely dependent on oil exports to Turkey and the Gulf.

Those are the most obvious challenges because oil is the only route to make money for Libya's government. There have been several other challenges as well.

Libya's main fields are in the east, and they are still producing, but they are not producing as much as they used to. Libya is now producing around 500,000 b/d from the east, compared to 1.8 million b/d in the 1980s. The west, which is producing more than 4 million b/d, is producing because of the presence of the new fields in the west and the presence of government-owned fields in the east.

Libya's oil production has been falling since the fall of Qaddafi.

The west is sustaining a war effort on its own. Misurata, the capital of the western region of Derna, has become a center of resistance to ISIS. The city is a hotbed of Islamist fighters. The IS affiliate in Libya, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, is operating out of the city. It is fighting its way across the country from the west, but it also has a presence in Tripoli, of which it controls the airport.

The east's oil production is not comparable to the west's. It is less than half the size of the west's, and it is still producing, but the government is doing little to control it.

Libya has a sovereign currency, the Libyan dinar, but it is not used. It is used instead in the black market to buy goods and services, but it is effectively worthless.

The government has been unable to negotiate with foreign oil companies to ensure that they would pay market prices for oil.

US Energy Information Administration http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=ly

The US and other nations are paying Libya around $1.5 billion a year in oil and other revenues, but the government is unable to ensure that those funds are being used to produce oil.

Libya is the world's largest exporter of crude oil and the world's third largest exporter of natural gas, but over 70% of that oil and gas is exported to Turkey and the Gulf. The US has been paying Libya $1.5 billion a year in oil and other revenues, but the government is unable to ensure that those funds are being used to produce oil.

Libya's oil and gas fields are not producing to the same extent they were two decades ago, but they are producing enough to meet the country's oil requirements. The country has a few fields producing more than 300,000 b/d, according to the International Energy Agency.

(Of course, if you're frustrated by something like a partner having premature ejaculation or your not being able to orgasm, that's a different story and worth working on.)

When it comes down to it, stressing about timing is a surefire way to take even longer.

"Sex should definitely last long enough for both partners to achieve mutual pleasure, generally in the form of orgasm," says Kerner. Since it's a myth that every woman can orgasm every time, the way you define satisfaction is up to you.

"A lot of women worry, especially when receiving oral sex, thinking, Is this taking too long? Are they enjoying themselves? How soon am I going to come?" says Kerner. "That kind of anxiety can really delay orgasm and inhibit pleasure."

Letting go of those thoughts is key to reaching orgasm in a time that feels comfortable to you (I know, it's like the sexual version of telling you not to think of a purple elephant, but it's true). One way to make this easier is by getting turned on
==================== COMPLETION 149 ====================
 by the sexual act before it happens. "You have to have a really good moment or the orgasm won't come," says Kerner. "Your body needs that time to get used to the sensation of orgasm, and then you have to build up to it."

If you're having trouble climaxing, having a partner hold you down can help keep things going. Both men and women can have sex in a way that keeps them feeling stimulated but not orgasmic. "I've had a lot of clients who are so turned on by the sex that they can't experience their orgasm," says Kerner. "They've been holding the guy down so that they can just enjoy the moment."

If you're having trouble reaching orgasm, one thing I've found works well is having a partner hold you down. Photo by David Boto

Wait—how long can I keep going?

The average orgasm lasts roughly 20 seconds. That's why it's important to have a partner hold you down before you reach climax. "I'd say the average orgasm lasts about 20 seconds," says Kerner. "When you're trying to stop your body from moving, the nerves in your body can't respond as quickly."

Of course, if you're having trouble getting it going, you can't let go of the guy for too long. "Both men and women can have sex in a way that keeps them feeling stimulated but not orgasmic," says Kerner. "They can have sex in a way that keeps them feeling really tense and especially sensitive to touch. They can have sex in a way that doesn't allow them to experience their orgasm."

If you're having trouble reaching orgasm, you can't let go of the guy for too long. Photo by David Boto

So, if you're having trouble reaching orgasm, what can you do to make sure you get there?

"One of the things that's helpful is to try to focus on your breathing," says Kerner. "I like to think of it like a yoga pose. You can't focus on your breath. You have to focus on your breath and what you're breathing in and out, concentrating on your breath."

Kerner also recommends doing some deep stretching and focusing on your breathing before you engage in sex. "I think a lot of women have trouble focusing on their breathing when they're trying to relax and do whatever it is that they're trying to do with their partner," she says. "The more you focus on your breathing, the more you can relax and let your partner take over."

And while you may be tempted to just give up and start looking for a new partner, Kerner says it's important not to give up on your sexual relationship entirely! "You can always see if there's something else you're interested in," she says. "It's also important not to feel like you can't have a relationship because of how you're feeling."

And if you're having trouble reaching orgasm, there's one thing you can do to help make that happen faster:

"If you're having trouble reaching orgasm, you can focus on what you're feeling," says Kerner. "The more you focus on what you're feeling, the more you can relax and let your partner take over."

 by what's going on in your partner's body. Use visual cues to help you figure out what feels good. For example, if your partner is fingering your clit, you might want to start to stroke your clitoris, or your partner might want to start to play with your nipples. (It's important to avoid visual cueing, however, because it makes the experience feel more like a task.)

"If your partner is playing with their own clit, it might feel super-orgasmic and it might even feel good! But if they're touching themselves, you want to be looking at them and seeing that they're enjoying it, too," says Kerner.

How long should you wait before you start feeling the rush of orgasm? That depends on how quickly you're coming down from your initial peak, and how long you've seen your partner getting off.

"I always tell women to wait a full minute before they come," says Kerner. "If you're having sex with somebody who has an orgasm every time you see them orgasm, then you know you're not having an orgasm [touching yourself] at the right time. You can start touching yourself and then the orgasm will come."

But if you're having sex with someone who has a problem with premature ejaculation and you're not seeing them coming, you might want to wait a little longer.

"If you're having sex with somebody who has an orgasm every time you see them orgasm, then you know you're not having an orgasm [touching yourself] at the right time," says Kerner. "You can start touching yourself and then the orgasm will come."

And if you're looking to give your partner a better experience, that's also good advice.

"With oral sex, you want to be stimulating your clitoris to get off," says Kerner. "It's the way you make your partner feel good. It's better if it's the first time they've had sex with you, too."

After all, your partner's first time probably isn't the only time you're going to be having sex with them.<|endoftext|>Buy Photo A student at Westside High School holds a sign in support of the Dakota Access pipeline, Thursday, January 6, 2016, at the school's graduation.

The Iowa Supreme Court has ordered the state to pay $1.7 million to a Native American tribe challenging the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline.

The Supreme Court's unanimous decision on Thursday will allow the Des Moines band of the Cherokee Nation to receive $1.75 million from the state for legal fees it spent defending its right to protest the pipeline.

The decision was issued three days after the Iowa Supreme Court stayed a lower court's order to stop construction of the pipeline, which would run 1,172 miles through four states and cross the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Supreme Court's decision allows the pipeline to continue construction.

The tribe had sued the state in 2014, claiming it violated the tribe's sovereign rights by approving the pipeline without any environmental study or tribal consultation.

A judge in December had allowed the pipeline to be built despite objections from the tribe, who said the pipeline would threaten its drinking water.

The state filed an appeal in December arguing that the tribe's lawsuit against the state was premature, and that the pipeline was a necessary step to developing the state's oil fields.

The case would have been heard by the Iowa Supreme Court, but it was stayed while the state appeals. The state said its lawyers would have cost more than $1 million to defend against the lawsuit.

4. It's about your connection with your partner.

"In the middle of a sex session, it's frustrating. You're trying to do something that's fun and exciting and exciting for yourself, but you're not enjoying it," says Kerner. "If you're not enjoying it, you're not going to want to have sex again. And that's clearly not the type of sex that you want to have."

Kerner says that frustration falls into two categories: You're not enjoying it and you're not connecting with your partner.

"The first is really about the physical connection, like how you're feeling physically and the kind of sexual touch you're doing," says Kerner. "If you're not enjoying kissing and cuddling and touching, your whole body isn't having a good time."

The second is more about the emotional connection, or how you feel about your partner. "You can feel connected with them, or you can feel disconnected," Kerner says. "You can feel super-connected to them, or you can feel really disconnected."

If you don't connect with your partner and your sex is feeling too long, there are a few ways you can fix it.

"If you find yourself not connecting or not enjoying your partner's body and words, it's completely normal," Kerner says. "It's natural to feel a little more disconnected as you're having sex. It's also normal for you to feel more disconnected when you're not feeling connected. It's important that you work on connecting and enjoying your relationship."

5. It's about your sexual health.

"A lot of people think that it's a problem to be having sex too long or that they don't have enough love for their partners," says Kerner. "But it's probably a problem for them to have very frequent sex or very short sex."

Kerner says that the problem could be that you're not having the right kind of sex. "Sex is a lot easier and more fun if it's good sex," Kerner says. "If you're having sex that's not good, you're not going to have a good time or get the results you're looking for."

To help you succeed, Kerner recommends scheduling sex with your partner in advance. "If you can schedule it in advance, it's going to be easier on everyone—you and your partner."

6. It's about your relationship.

"I think it's really important to have sex in a healthy way," says Kerner. "If you're planning to have sex more than once a week or if you're having sex more than once a month, that's not healthy."

If you're having sex too often or too soon, Kerner says that it's important to work on your relationship. "If you're having sex that's not healthy, you're not going to enjoy it. You're not going to enjoy it because you're not connecting with your partner."

7. It's about your self-esteem.

"Having sex too often or too soon and not connecting with your partner could cause you to become less invested in your sexual self," says Kerner. "That's a huge reason why people are having sex late in their relationship."

 intense lovemaking, and sometimes you want to do something that's really fun and adventurous. The kind of sex you want to have affects the length of the sex," says Kerner. (Of course, if you're frustrated by something like a partner having premature ejaculation or your not being able to orgasm, that's a different story and worth working on.)

When it comes down to it, stressing about timing is a surefire way to take even longer.

"Sex should definitely last long enough for both partners to achieve mutual pleasure, generally in the form of orgasm," says Kerner. Since it's a myth that every woman can orgasm every time, the way you define satisfaction is up to you.

"A lot of women worry, especially when receiving oral sex, thinking, Is this taking too long? Are they enjoying themselves? How soon am I going to come?" says Kerner. "That kind of anxiety can really delay orgasm and inhibit pleasure."

Letting go of those thoughts is key to reaching orgasm in a time that feels comfortable to you (I know, it's like the sexual version of telling you not to think of a purple elephant, but it's true). One way to make this easier is by getting turned on

 by the sexual activities you're having. "Many people whose sex lives are based on intercourse report a lot of vaginal stimulation during sex, which can be distracting and difficult to control," says Kerner. "Try adding some new sexual activities to your repertoire like massaging, rubbing, kissing, or even fantasizing. Someday that could lead to an orgasm."

If you're having trouble reaching orgasm, you might want to talk to a mental health professional, says Kerner, who has seen her fair share of women who have issues with premature ejaculation or premature ejaculation-related anxiety and who need to work through those issues.

"Some women are so afraid of losing their partner, they go to extreme measures to keep them satisfied," says Kerner. "They take things like birth control or use condoms solely to avoid the possibility of orgasm. I would encourage women to talk to a therapist if they are having problems, especially if they are experiencing anxiety during sex."

The woman was trying to make it to a nearby beach when the floodwaters swept her away, local officials said on Monday.

The woman had apparently pitched her tent on a beach in nearby Cordoba when the storm hit.

"We received a call on Sunday afternoon from the beach where the woman was stranded saying she was out in the water," a Murcia police spokesman told AFP.

"Local authorities went to save her but she was too cold and didn't want to be saved."

The woman finally got out of the water at the spot and was taken to hospital "with minor injuries", the police spokesman said.

The storm was sent by the jet stream and was later accompanied by a strong tornado, the weather agency said.

The storm was one of a number of "lightening storms" that hit the region, which has been hit by heavy rain in recent days.

The mayor of a nearby village, Tomas Perez, said the winds had caused a "huge wave" to hit the coastal village of San Marcos de Calatrava, destroying some buildings and forcing residents to flee.

The mayor of Cordoba, "Eloy" Villanueva, said the storm had damaged the town hall, a school, a church and some buildings in the nearby village of San Marcos de Calatrava.

The town is in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range which lies to the east of the Murcia region.

Lightning is the main threat to the region, with the storm bringing lightning and thunderstorms to the region along with torrential rain and gusts of up to 90km/h.

The association's endorsement of the presumptive Republican nominee has been controversial, as some gun rights advocates have complained that Trump's positions on gun control have changed since they endorsed him in May.

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump said he was not going to change his position on gun rights during the general election campaign, despite his controversial remarks about banning Muslims entering the United States.

/16, 2x Top 8 of the Season, Top 8 of the Season, 1st place at the Yoyo City Barcrafts

There are a multitude of players with a lot of potential in the game of Counter Strike. They all have a slightly different skill level and playstyle, but each of them has a chance to become a true contender for the title of best in the world. With so many top players looking to join teams over the course of the remainder of the year, I decided to compile a list of players who I think have an extremely high chance of making it to the next level. These players will be the focus of my next article. In this article I will list what I expect to be the top ten players in the game. We'll break down their strengths and weaknesses, what they do well, what they need to work on, and how they will make the jump from the amateur scene to the professional scene. Let's get started.

10. Vincent 'Happy' Schopenhauer

Happy is a name that you're probably familiar with. If you're not, you're seriously missing out. This Austrian has been one of the most consistent players in the game for quite some time now. He was one of the first players to win the European Championships back in 2002, and has gone on to win the World Championships twice in the past few years. Happy was the most consistent player in the game for a while before the Counter Strike: Global Offensive release and every year since then he's been in the top ten. He's the most consistent player in the game right now, and he's a player that nobody really knows how to stop.

9. Kaoru 'Kaoru' Nagasawa

Is there anything Kaoru can't do, you ask? He's a player who is one of the best in the world at throwing grenades. But don't let that fool you. He's an extremely intelligent player that is capable of playing more than one role on the same team. This might sound simple, but it is actually extremely difficult to do. He's capable of playing out of position on his team, and he's capable of playing a more traditional carry role, as well as playing off of a sniper. He's a player that can play any role on the team, but best be prepared for him to line up anywhere, at any time.

8. David 'Rifkin' Rifkin

If you've ever watched the season 2 finals of the ESL Pro Series, you've no doubt heard of Rifkin. He was one of the most dominant players in the game and was very close to winning the Season 2 finals. He was true to form in the finals, as he defeated the likes of KennyS and Havok to secure the top spot in the overall standings. He's not only a great player, but he's also a great interview. Can you imagine sitting next to someone with this much personality and attitude? He's a player that the majority of the community would consider a "prodigal son," and rightfully so. He has an almost unfailing ability to play well when given the opportunity, and he's a player that can make or break any team.

7. Chris 'HuK' Loranger

HuK is the closest thing Counter Strike has to a maverick. He's one of the few players in the game that hasn't been afraid to play outside of his comfort zone. He's not afraid to dive headfirst into the battlefield and he's not afraid to throw off his gameplan to get a better grasp on the situation. You might even call him a player that is a giant dick. He's been known to be a bit of a brat

He's a strong and versatile character, having the ability to perform at any level of play. He's also got a great deal of potential and is definitely a top player to watch as he continues to develop. MVD Accolades — 2x 2nd place in the final 1 of the 1st season of 2nd place, 2nd place in the final 3 of the 3rd season of 2nd place Previous Teams — Possibly BiT, potentially BiT, possibly Boston Major: Qualifiers MVD was one of the more notable players to arrive in the scene with a sizeable and loyal following. The core of the mid-range, MVD is a solid all-around performer with a lot of potential. However, he's not the main focus of his team, so he's prone to being a bit inconsistent.

This guy is the definition of a beast. I don't think almost any of the current crop of players are capable of competing with him in a real game. Dslyecxi Accolades — Debut of the Season, Qn 2009 best in show Previous Teams — iGotUrPistola, Idiot's Corner, MinimosuDnS, Yoyotech If you've never heard of Dslyecxi, you're probably not a serious player. He's arguably the most popular player to ever grace the servers, and he's played for some of the most prestigious teams in the country. There's a reason why he's a meta god. Just ask any of the players who have been to his house. He's a constant in the meta, and he has the skill to back it up.

My picks:

Well, I'm awesome. So, here's my picks.

Rufioh, the one-man army. He is the single most good-looking person in the game. He has the most nice clothes and has been given the nickname "the man of many clothes". He has made a name for himself by killing team captains. He is an extremely aggressive player and does not normally play in a traditional pocket. He is the master of the double AWP. His fragging potential is so high that he could potentially outplay any player in the game. If you can manage to get a good deal on him, you might just be the best player in the world.

IeZaeL, the best AWPer in the game. He's been a top contender in the top teams ever since he was a rookie. He plays very aggressively, and he's able to carry a team on his shoulders. He is extremely good at shooting angles, and his AWP is one of the best effective weapons in the game. If I were to pick a player in the game, I'd pick him. He is simply infuriating.

I have a lot of respect for JW. He's one of the best highlander players of all time, and he will succeed in any game he plays. He has a very unique playstyle and I think that his aggressive nature is a good complement to his skill.

How does the pick work? I'm really not sure. I guess in the short term, you might want to pick players with a higher skill level, but the long term you should play to your team's strengths.

The other thing that's interesting is that this time around we have more than just the top five players. There are a few other players who might be a little less known but are currently playing highlander. For example, there's a player named SlasheR, a player who has been known for his insane T sides. He also has a very nice modelling portfolio and is a close friend of Razer's founder, Min-Liang Tan. Thanks to the fact that he didn't win the 2v2, he was invited in the first place.

 US last year.

According to Lawrence Berkeley's wind analysis, over 8GW of capacity were installed, bringing the US' cumulative capacity to nearly 75GW. That still trails China's capacity, which is nearly double that. But, because the US has such excellent resources, it generates more electricity through wind than any other country; wind now accounts for over five percent of the total electricity generated in the states.

One area that's gone untapped is offshore wind, which has been prohibitively expensive compared to onshore. Globally, there are 12GW of capacity installed; in the US, the number is zero. But that should change this year, as the first offshore turbine installations are now in progress along the coast of Rhode Island.

Nearly everything about the turbines being installed is also getting bigger. The average capacity in the US is now two MegaWatts, up from about 1.4 a decade ago. The average rotor height has become about 10 meters higher in that time. And the blades have grown considerably larger: "In 2008, no turbines employed rotors that were 100 meters in diameter or larger; by 2015, 86 percent of new installed wind capacity featured rotor diameters of at least 100 meters."

Part of this is happening

 because of the push by the industry to get more capacity online as quickly as possible. But the other part is because of policy. The US Department of Energy has given a number of incentives to get this done, such as the Production Tax Credit, which has a maximum credit of 30 percent of the cost of the turbine. But, the real game-changer is that the agency now has a program called the Wind Vision Program, which gives up to 50 percent of the cost of a turbine to developers who install wind turbines in areas considered to have a high potential for wind power (called wind corridors).

Governments have also been pushing for more of this, too. In Europe, a number of countries have been "decarbonizing" their economies by increasing the share of renewable energy in their power mix. Germany is replacing coal-fired power plants with new wind turbines, and the UK is aiming to have a 20 percent share of wind power in its electricity mix by 2020, a goal that could be met if the UK's offshore wind farms are built.

The US, on the other hand, is building only an estimated 10 percent of its planned 42,000 MW of wind power by 2030, although these projects will require restructuring the grid to service this larger output.

The good news is that US wind projects are still coming online at a steady pace. And while they might not be as big as some of the projects in Europe, the more capacity being built, the more of an impact they will have.

The FBI and Justice Department have spent several months investigating a top adviser to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, with just weeks to go before Election Day, according to people familiar with the matter.

The probe has involved a broad sweep, including a focus on Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager at the time and a longtime associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two have known each other for decades, and Manafort worked for years as a political consultant for numerous dictators and strongmen, employing tactics that included employing prostitutes to lure foreign officials.

The FBI's interest in Manafort has intensified in recent weeks, according to the people familiar with the matter, as the campaign has struggled to stay on top of its delegate count.

The FBI, which is leading the investigation into Manafort, first became interested in him in 2014 as it began to look into allegations that Manafort's consulting firm had received millions of dollars in secret payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter.

The FBI's interest was sparked by an ongoing investigation of the party's activities by American law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Justice, the Treasury Department and the National Security Agency, these people said.

When investigators became aware of the secret payments, they compared it to financial records showing that Manafort had bought millions of dollars' worth of property in the United States and transferred millions more to accounts in the United States and elsewhere, these people said.

A spokesman for Manafort declined to comment. A spokesman for the FBI didn't respond to a request for comment.

The FBI investigation, which hasn't been previously reported, now appears to be entering a new phase.

The bureau is examining new documents and interviewing witnesses as it seeks to determine whether Manafort broke the law by failing to register as a foreign agent, these people said. If he did, he could become a focus of the bureau's broader investigation into whether Trump associates coordinated with the Kremlin to meddle in last year's presidential election, these people said.

Manafort has not been accused of any wrongdoing, and he has denied any wrongdoing.

The investigation into Manafort has been taken over by FBI agents with the help of

 because of the way that wind farms are arranged. The wind is always blowing somewhere, but because of the direction that the wind blows and the height of the turbines, it can be difficult for turbines to locate where they are supposed to. In order to get the best locations, the wind farms have to be arranged in a way that allows for the blades to rotate in a circular pattern.

But the big changes are coming in the way that the turbines are designed. For example, the blades on the largest turbines are now made entirely from carbon fibre. Additionally, many of the turbines we've seen in the US have been equipped with lightweight, low-cost electronics, which allow them to operate with a much lower voltage than they would otherwise. The small amount of power that they produce is being converted to heat, and that heat is used to recharge the batteries on the turbines.

In the UK, the government is aiming to bring wind power to all of its metropolitan areas by 2025. But that will require investing in both the technology and the infrastructure. This should help to bring down costs, and lower the cost of wind power in the future.

That still trails China's capacity, which is nearly double that. But, because the US has such excellent resources, it generates more electricity through wind than any other country; wind now accounts for over five percent of the total electricity generated in the states.

One area that's gone untapped is offshore wind, which has been prohibitively expensive compared to onshore. Globally, there are 12GW of capacity installed; in the US, the number is zero. But that should change this year, as the first offshore turbine installations are now in progress along the coast of Rhode Island.

Nearly everything about the turbines being installed is also getting bigger. The average capacity in the US is now two MegaWatts, up from about 1.4 a decade ago. The average rotor height has become about 10 meters higher in that time. And the blades have grown considerably larger: "In 2008, no turbines employed rotors that were 100 meters in diameter or larger; by 2015, 86 percent of new installed wind capacity featured rotor diameters of at least 100 meters."

 at a time when the cost of wind energy is low. But it's also because the world is facing an energy crisis. While fossil fuels are causing climate change, wind is the only viable solution to the problem: "Wind energy today is the cheapest source of renewable energy available to us, and it has a much better ability to control the weather than any other form of renewable energy, including solar and even nuclear power."

While wind is the cheapest option, it's also the most environmentally sustainable, because it's created in a way that's not causing the pollution that the other forms of renewable energy are.

With that in mind, why doesn't the US have more offshore wind? It's because of the political situation. The US is, as you might have guessed, one of the most anti-renewable nations in the world. The country has a strong fossil fuel lobby, and the President has been a champion of the fossil fuel industry. The industry's lobbying has furthered the obstacles to offshore wind in particular.

Here's a summary of the least used offshore wind technologies in the US.

The most used technology is vertical axis wind turbine, which is the easiest to build. The most expensive is the horizontal axis wind turbine, which is the most expensive to build, but has the highest efficiency, and has been used in Europe. The cost and reliability of these technologies is often the reason that offshore wind has yet to take off in the US, despite the fact that it's the cheapest option.

But offshore wind is now beginning to take off, as evidenced by the recent construction of the first offshore wind farm in Rhode Island, according to the US Department of Energy. The Obama administration is also pushing for a number of new offshore wind projects in the waters off the coast of Rhode Island.

The good news is that the technology is getting better. Big wind farms are being built in the U.S., and we're seeing more and more wind turbines being installed, not just offshore. The only way that we'll be able to keep all of this happening is if we make some changes to the political climate.

The IMF has joined the project, which is backed by the African Development Bank and the World Bank, and hopes to launch the new currency unions next year, even though the African Union and other African governments have expressed reservations.

The project, which aims to encourage African governments to issue their own currencies, is being discussed as part of the African Union's governing summit in Addis Ababa. It is also scheduled to be discussed at the summit of the Group of 20.

However, the IMF said in a statement it had become "concerned" about the project's long-term effects on "government financial stability".

"The project's focus on establishing national currencies may undermine government financial stability by driving up exchange rate volatility and, in fact, may represent the most significant threat to government financial stability in the region," the IMF said.

 in response to a federal mandate, the Production Tax Credit (PTC), which is up to 40 percent of the cost of wind power projects. As Bloomberg reports, "State and federal tax credits in the US make wind power significantly more affordable than solar power, which requires solar panels to be installed on rooftops."

A large part of the reason for this is that the US has a lot of land for offshore wind. The Five Forts off the coasts of Maine and Rhode Island are expected to generate about half of the nation's electricity, so there's a lot of land for development.

Further, the government had a generous policy of giving tax breaks to domestic wind companies, as well as assistance for the companies that build the turbines. This helped boost the technology and drive the growth in the industry.

But the experts I spoke with said that the PTC is leading to a surge in offshore wind. "The PTC has been a game-changer and has led to a lot of the growth in the industry," said Howard Herzog, a professor of engineering at the University of Oregon. "The incentives are still going to be there, but we're going to see a lot more development than we did in the last five years."

The Administration is considering a change to the law to reduce the PTC to 10 percent, which would be less generous than what the companies are paying, but would still be a huge boon for the industry.

What's more, the industry is already on target to double its wind power capacity this year, and maybe even triple it.

So, in the end, the US is on track to become the world leader in offshore wind. That's not a bad thing.<|endoftext|>"The problem with the world is that it is full of people who think they know everything, but actually they don't."

Professional pressure

You feel sorry for the United players, who were already under a great deal of professional pressure tonight. Whether their season is considered a success or a failure already hinged on the outcome. To this is now added a new and entirely unfamiliar emotional pressure: your city is grieving, you must not let your people down. It's wrong and it's unfair to the players, but it's an inevitable consequence of the way we try to make sense of the world through stories. Manchester United play the final two days after the attack, so the final necessarily becomes part of the story of the city's struggle to live with the attack.

Yesterday demonstrated the inadequacy of some familiar scripts in an age of massively accelerated communication. Take the script of journalists contacting victims' relatives for comment in the wake of a disaster. This has always been an uncomfortable part of how news stories are constructed, but in the past it was at least much more difficult for journalists to locate and contact the affected people, meaning that fewer of them ultimately succeeded in doing so.

 of shock, horror, and disgust, all aimed at finalising the narrative and reinforcing the general sense that Manchester was devastated.

It's not that the reporters aren't trying to be respectful of the relatives' feelings, it's that in their desperation to confirm their own emotional state and to justify their own credentials, they are, in effect, participating in the press release.

This, of course, only serves to add to the already overwhelming sense of crisis. For all the focus on the players, it is the United players themselves who will be remembered most for this. They don't need to be told that. As Whitehall observers have noted, the tour to Australia may have been a set-piece success, but the tour itself was an utter failure.

Chris Smalling, one of the kindest and most professional players in the squad, was axed for an ill-judged challenge on Raheem Sterling, which was deemed to have been motivated by racism. The player has since claimed that he doesn't believe the tackle was racist, though many in the football community will disagree. It was, in the end, a publicity stunt, which has only served to strengthen the impression that the players are in the wrong here.

The tournament itself was a disaster. England failed to win a match, they were beaten in the group stage and only managed to get through the semi-finals by virtue of an extremely fortunate goal in the second leg.

The United players were massively relieved to go home with a trophy. Had they lost the final, would they have been lauded as heroes? Would the city have felt significantly better?

What we're left with is a sense of regret, of a city that cannot quite believe that a tragedy of this magnitude could have happened, a city that will do its best to minimize the trauma. It's also a city that needs to figure out ways to make sense of what happened. It's not as simple as blaming the players, because there are two sides to the story.

In the immediate aftermath of the attack, there was a feeling of anxiety and fear. The Manchester Evening News' front page read "MASSIVE DEATH RATE," but as the days and weeks passed, the reality of the toll of the attack became clearer. The city felt more and more unsafe, and the failure of the police to prevent it from happening only exacerbated the feeling that the city was being pushed further and further away from normalcy.

It was not for a lack of trying, of course. The city's emergency services and the government immediately made a series of announcements and announcements, including a timeline of the attack and the locations of parks and places that were off limits. It's a terrible thing to have to read, but it's clear that this was a situation that the city was facing in its own right—that it was not simply a problem of terrorism.

By the time the attacks in Paris happened, the city's response was complete. It had been a long time coming. The city had been under siege for an extended period, but it was finally able to come together, to let the pain of the attack seep into every aspect of its life.

It's not that the players don't need to be made to feel better about their achievement. It's more that, for the city, the celebration of that achievement has become a distraction from the deeper issues.

The fact that there is concern about the player contracts will be a big issue, even if the players themselves don't necessarily feel that they have been treated fairly. It's possible that the players will be seeking compensation for the amount of money they have lost, but the fact that there was such

 of outrage at the paucity of response. Only hours after the attack the Telegraph, The Guardian, BBC and Sky all ran stories about how "too little, too late" was the phrase most often used by victims' relatives.

This is not a failure of communications, but a failure of script. In a city which has gone through a similar sense of crisis after the 2005 bombings (and the police response was similarly inadequate), the overwhelming sense is that the response of the authorities has been woefully inadequate. That very same day, the BBC's Mark Urban wrote that the police had done "a very poor job of public relations in the immediate aftermath of the Manchester attack".

In addition, the BBC's popular "Manchester Live" programme was cancelled after the attack despite an outcry from viewers. Police and other officials only finally decided to re-launch the show yesterday afternoon after a meeting of the force's leadership and the Manchester mayor.

The same day, the Mail Online, which is itself a great example of post-attack coverage, published a long article headlined "Manchester bomb survivor: We were told it was an IRA bomb but were deceived". The article offers a helpful summary of the day's events:

"The Mail Online has learned that police were warned the bomb was a 'Taliban-style' device but were then told by counter-terrorism bosses that it was an IED – a homemade bomb – and again told that it was an IRA attack."

It also heaps praise on the police who supposedly prevented the attack:

"The police, who are justifiably proud of their bravery in the face of the atrocity, were rightly praised. The Mail understands the force was told by the Home Office's National Counter Terrorism Security Group that the device was a 'Taliban-style' bomb."

This is not just the product of some unaccountable man in the Mail's London office. It's a common theme in subsequent coverage from some of the most reputable media outlets in the country. The BBC, which is the most prominent outlet to report on the attack, published a definitive report yesterday morning. It failed to acknowledge that the Manchester Arena had been the scene of similar attacks before. It failed to disclose that the concertgoers had been stopped from leaving the building by armed police for up to 20 minutes. It failed to mention that the bomber had been killed just as he began his attack.

"Everything that could go wrong did, and it was all down to the NHS and police," said a woman who appeared in a news report that appeared on the BBC's website. We know this because she was the first person to be interviewed by the BBC that morning. And because the Mail Online also published a report about her story.

The BBC's "suicide bomber" story was followed by a series of reports claiming that the Manchester Arena had been evacuated because a suicide bomber had detonated an improvised explosive device.

In contrast, the BBC's Mark Urban reported that the bomb had not been a bomb and that the death toll was not yet known. The BBC did not mention the fact that it had been closed down, and that there had been no evacuation of the building.

How do we know that the BBC's coverage was inaccurate? Because it was. It was wrong. It was completely wrong.

But the story was not entirely wrong. The BBC did not mention the fact that the bomber had been killed just as he began his attack. It did not mention that the bomber had been stopped just as he began his attack. It did not mention that the bomber had been named by multiple sources as Salman Abedi. It did not mention that the bomber had been named as Salman Abedi by multiple sources as he was being hunted down by police

 of grief. The victims' families are desperate to tell their stories, but the reporters are determined to hear them and not try to discern their motives. Requests for comment have become an almost mandatory requirement – but what is a reporter to do when the families have already spoken to the press?

The logic of the story must therefore always be more or less the same. It must validate the tragedy for those who participated in it – victims, families, friends, the people of the city. The only possible deviation from the script is if there is any suggestion that the story is unfair or incomplete.

If the story leaves out any hint of sympathy for the victims or their families, or takes the place of empathy altogether, it is rejected out of hand. If the story leaves out any mention of the city's resilience or resilience in general, it is rejected out of hand.

It's just a tragedy

If you are a journalist, you are required by your profession to respect the feelings of the victims. This doesn't change the fact that they have been killed, and to blame the victims for their own deaths is to deny the reality of the situation. It is also to deny the fact that it is true that a vast number of people died this week, and that a great many of those people are people you're supposed to be writing about.

If, however, you are a journalist, you are required by your profession to work in a world of endless tragedy. The tragedy is inevitable, and it is the job of the media to report it to a captive audience. The tragedy is always real, and the only way to address it is to find what you can about it. The tragedy is always awful, and the only way for journalists to make it bearable is to stay focused on the things that make it bearable.

Somehow, in the rush to explain the attack, the media have lost sight of their role as storytellers. As a result, all of yesterday's coverage feels more like a soap opera than a dispassionate examination of the events of the day. It tries to convince us that the attack was not just terrible – it was "just a tragedy".

It's possible to write a story that acknowledges this, that acknowledges that the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino and Orlando and Istanbul are terrible and that everyone is affected by them – but the only way to do that is to acknowledge that the attacks are terrible and to stay on top of the story.

Instead, the media took the story of the city and its people, the story of all of the people who were, are or will be impacted by the attacks, and presented it to us in a farcical form. The story was told with the same desperate and unprofessional dispassion that we've seen from this city over the past week.

The narrative is "the city is grieving", and for the most part, that is true – but that's not the story. The story is "this is awful, and we need to be informed".

When the story of the city becomes the story of the victims, not the story of all of the victims, there's a problem.<|endoftext|>A County Probate Court judge has thrown out a marriage equality lawsuit filed by a lesbian couple, claiming that the couple's marriage violated the state's constitution.

 of sympathy. The irony is that all these grieving relatives could do to help the journalists out is to say the words "I'm devastated, I can't talk to you." It would be interesting to know which of these journalists felt a more pressing need to contact family members.

It's easy to understand why this feels so tedious and out of place, but it's great television. It's the same reason it's great television to read a newspaper's account of a tragedy, in which the people who are writing are driven by an urgent desire to tell their readers what they think, and not necessarily what they feel. The tragedy is the opportunity for those gathered to feel what they're writing about; the sadness is a byproduct of the interview.

I don't know if the United players were specifically discouraged from speaking to journalists in the aftermath of the attack, but I do know that the pressure on them to do so was, in the words of their manager, "somewhat overwhelming." It was difficult to tell if the players' nerves were heightened by the emotions of the moment; if so, then this isn't the most professional way to cope with the loss of a loved one.

Different world

I don't know if the United players were specifically discouraged from speaking to journalists in the aftermath of the attack, but I do know that the pressure on them to do so was, in the words of their manager, "somewhat overwhelming." It was difficult to tell if the players' nerves were heightened by the emotions of the moment; if so, then this isn't the most professional way to cope with the loss of a loved one.

The world is different to that of old, though. Those of us who grew up in the age of televised first-person-shooting video games were used to the idea that we could get away with almost anything. The shooter in Columbine would have been forgiven for getting bored with the game after a while, and moving on to the next one instead. This doesn't happen anymore, but that doesn't make the world any less complicated.

This is why some of my readers will not have particularly warm feelings about the role of the media in this story. It's not that they think that it was acceptable for the United players to speak to journalists in the aftermath of the attack, but that the press needs to be more professional about their coverage of the attackers to ensure that it's the people who have been affected by them, not merely the people who want to be.

That doesn't mean they're not trying. I'm sure that the player-of-the-week, who couldn't even remember the name of the school where he had been killed, was just being honest when he told reporters, "I don't really know what happened." But that doesn't mean that the media should be cowed into silence.

The human cost of the attack in Manchester last night continues to be felt around the world, and while the media needs to do their best to report on it, they also need to be aware of the fact that the people who most need to hear from them are the victims of this tragedy.

If the media wants to ensure that people are informed about the events in Manchester, they need to do so by showing empathy with the victims, not by allowing the grief of the families to be used as a pretext for exploiting journalists. The media can't continue to be the shock troops of the public relations industry, but they also need to remember that they're accountable to their readers, and that the public has a right to know how they're reporting on the tragedy.

ly speaking, achieving a balanced budget by 2026 would require roughly $7.8 trillion of deficit reduction over ten years; that figure would increase to nearly $20 trillion over a decade assuming the enactment of Mr. Trump's campaign proposals (based on our central cost estimate).5

To achieve this level of savings with spending reductions alone would require huge cuts. For example, cutting the entire budget across the board (other than the VA and immigration enforcement, which are increased in his plans) would require a reduction of 40 percent – a figure that is unlikely to be achieved.

Those cuts, however, include cutting Social Security benefits by up to half – when Mr. Trump has argued multiple times that Social Security benefits should be left alone. Exempting Social Security, spending cuts would need to total 56 percent. Also removing Medicare, which Mr. Trump has called for protecting as well (though he has also proposed some small potential savings in the Medicare space), cuts would need to total 75 percent. And if defense were also exempt, an area Mr. Trump has committed to strengthening, it becomes impossible to balance the budget with only spending cuts.

Simply paying for the initiatives on his website and keeping the debt on its current unsustainable course would also require large cuts –
==================== COMPLETION 165 ====================
 perhaps even enough to wipe out Mr. Trump's plan. That's because his tax and spending proposals are loaded with costly tax breaks and loopholes that would offset only a small portion of the cost of a balanced budget.

To balance the budget, for example, Mr. Trump would need to eliminate the tax breaks at the top of the income scale – the so-called "Trump loophole" – and zero out all other deductions and exclusions, which would cost $5.5 trillion. That is, he would need to pay for the tax cuts by eliminating tax expenditures that boost incomes for everyone. These are loopholes for state and local income and sales taxes on income and capital gains.

The Trump loophole would be phased out over ten years (with some exceptions) and then eliminated completely after ten years. Similarly, bracket creep – the increase in tax rates for higher-income earners that Mr. Trump has proposed – would be reversed over ten years.

When it comes to the mortgage interest deduction, which is used by nearly two-thirds of Americans, a rule change would need to be made to make the mortgage interest deduction more broadly available. And when it comes to the charitable deduction, which the vast majority of households claim, Mr. Trump would need to ban its use by those with incomes over $1 million – though, it should be noted, the largest percentage of taxpayers claiming the deduction already do so.

Finally, to balance the budget, Mr. Trump would need to eliminate the $2.4 trillion in carried interest, which is currently taxed at a lower rate than regular income. This is a huge loophole that has resulted in the wealthiest Americans paying tax rates as low as 15 percent on some of their income. Eliminating it would reduce the tax burden on the rest of us.

All told, Mr. Trump's plan would require an approximately $5.1 trillion reduction in government spending over ten years. And it gets worse.

Mr. Trump's plan also assumes that he can avoid raising any taxes on the wealthiest Americans. If the tax cuts he plans to enact are financed by lower tax rates and a simpler tax code, he stands to gain from a dramatically reduced tax burden.6

But if his tax plan is financed by higher taxes on the middle class, the American people will pay higher taxes as they have been for decades.

The Trump plan is a massive tax cut for wealthy individuals, corporations, and the billionaire class at large. But it is not a spending plan.

And that's why it's a catastrophe.

For example, in 2011, the Pentagon spent nearly $5 billion on contractors, but only reported $1.1 billion to Congress. That's because the Pentagon disclosed only a fraction of the money it spent on contractors.

Today, the defense industry is a huge business, with nearly 50,000 active companies. The Pentagon spends more than $700 billion a year on defense contractors, and the funds it spends on them are going to the military.

The government's accounting on contractors is so terrible that it's time to ask why the Pentagon is spending so much on contractors. Here are five common reasons for the military-industrial complex.

1. The Defense Department is a huge business that needs to grow

 the most significant being the nearly $2 trillion in annual reductions in defense spending. This high level of cuts would also necessitate the elimination of a number of tax expenditures (those that lower tax rates for the wealthy and corporations) and a significant reduction in other programs.

The matter of balancing the budget through spending cuts alone is further complicated by the fact that it would require a great deal of accounting sleight-of-hand. Although Mr. Trump has proposed very large spending reductions, he has consistently glossed over the fact that he would need to somehow offset these cuts with tax increases, and he has failed to provide any details as to how he would do this. This leaves the development of a credible plan to balance the budget with spending cuts as the only way to ensure that the Trump budget is sustainable, and that the debt ceiling is not used to force Mr. Trump to make sharp cuts in essential government services.

The numbers are not good. Spending cuts alone will not achieve the goals Mr. Trump laid out on the campaign trail. The cost of deficits has risen dramatically in the past three years, with federal spending growing by 12.2 percent of GDP between 2009 and 2015, and government debt has exploded to record levels.6 Add in the impact of rising health care costs and the cost of financing an expanded military and the amount of deficit reduction required is staggering.

The fact that the Trump campaign has failed to outline a credible plan to achieve deficit reduction through spending cuts alone makes it all the more important that Congress work with the administration to produce a plan. Congress should take the lead in crafting this plan, because the Trump administration has indicated it will not.

The Trump administration should deliver on its promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Democrats have waged a prolonged war on Obamacare, but it is not working, and it is time to move on.

Health care is a complex issue, but the basic premise is this: in a free society, everyone should be able to access affordable health care. But Obamacare has not provided access to affordable health care to the American people. The program has failed to deliver on its promise to lower the cost of health care, and it has also failed to deliver on its promise to expand insurance coverage.

There is no other way to replace Obamacare than by repealing the unpopular provisions, such as its individual mandate. Without the mandate, insurance markets will collapse, and premiums will skyrocket. Without insurance, the people who would be covered by Obamacare will be forced to purchase it on the open market.

Republicans should lead on repealing Obamacare. They should also lead on developing a replacement that works, and that delivers on the promises the American people made to us in the 2016 election.

The repeal of Obamacare must be accompanied by a replacement that preserves access to affordable, high-quality health care for all Americans. As a starting point, Republicans should consider the following:

Reform Medicaid and Medicare by means-testing eligibility and tying eligibility for traditional Medicare to a person's ability to pay.

Refinancing the federal debt by modifying the tax treatment of debt held by the federal government.

Tax the rich.

Reform the tax code by means-testing the tax deductions currently available to the wealthy and repealing the preferential tax treatment of capital gains and dividends.

Republicans must provide an alternative to Obamacare. The repeal of Obamacare must be accompanied by the development of a replacement that preserves access to affordable, high-quality health care for all Americans. As a starting point, Republicans should consider the following:

======================================== SAMPLE 167 ========================================
ly speaking, achieving a balanced budget by 2026 would require roughly $7.8 trillion of deficit reduction over ten years; that figure would increase to nearly $20 trillion over a decade assuming the enactment of Mr. Trump's campaign proposals (based on our central cost estimate).5

To achieve this level of savings with spending reductions alone would require huge cuts. For example, cutting the entire budget across the board (other than the VA and immigration enforcement, which are increased in his plans) would require a reduction of 40 percent – a figure that is unlikely to be achieved.

Those cuts, however, include cutting Social Security benefits by up to half – when Mr. Trump has argued multiple times that Social Security benefits should be left alone. Exempting Social Security, spending cuts would need to total 56 percent. Also removing Medicare, which Mr. Trump has called for protecting as well (though he has also proposed some small potential savings in the Medicare space), cuts would need to total 75 percent. And if defense were also exempt, an area Mr. Trump has committed to strengthening, it becomes impossible to balance the budget with only spending cuts.

Simply paying for the initiatives on his website and keeping the debt on its current unsustainable course would also require large cuts –
==================== COMPLETION 167 ====================
 from $9.7 trillion to $7.8 trillion. To pay for that, his proposals would require further reductions in tax expenditures – the deductions and credits that allow people to write off their own taxes – and the elimination of some progressive tax rates, including the Alternative Minimum Tax, the estate tax, and the corporate tax.

These are the taxes Mr. Trump wants to eliminate, but he is quick to say that he wants to keep them. This is not a coincidence – he is lying.

The U.S. tax code provides the largest loophole for the super wealthy, and Mr. Trump has been trying to fix that. Under previous presidents, the tax code was designed to be progressive, with rates for the rich and middle-class and small businesses. Trump wants to change that, and he wants to do it without raising taxes on anyone.

In his speech, Mr. Trump stated that the tax plan he is proposing would "eliminate the tax loophole that benefits so many special interest hedge fund managers."6 But that is simply false. The real tax loophole is in the tax code that benefits hedge fund and private equity managers, who are currently able to pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. 7

Mr. Trump is also trying to distract from the fact that he is proposing huge tax cuts for the rich. In a recent speech, he said that "the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations in our country are paying nearly nothing in taxes."8 The truth is that they are already paying about 40 percent of the nation's total taxes, and the Trump tax plan would reduce their tax rates substantially.

The Trump tax plan would also do significant damage to the federal deficit. He has claimed that his tax cuts would not increase the national debt, and that they would pay for themselves by reducing the federal deficit. This is not true.

The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated in December that under Mr. Trump's plan, the debt held by the public would rise from 41.8 percent in 2017 to 55.4 percent in 2027.9

The Trump tax plan would also actually increase the deficit by $10 trillion over the next decade.10 The Tax Policy Center was even more certain about this: it estimated that Mr. Trump's tax plan would increase the national debt by $9.8 trillion over the next decade.11

The Trump tax plan would also increase the national debt by over $7 trillion over the next ten years.12

This is not the first time that Mr. Trump has claimed that his tax plan would pay for itself. In a speech in August, he said:

I will give a major tax cut to the middle class. …They're getting absolutely nothing.13

Here again, it's a lie. The Trump tax plan would increase the national debt by over $9.8 trillion over ten years.14

This is what the Trump tax plan does: it reduces tax revenue, it increases the national debt, and it increases the deficit. It is a con.

Mr. Trump is trying to fool Americans into believing that his tax plan will pay for itself. It will not. And with the economy growing at its slowest pace since the Great Recession, he is right to be concerned.

This is not a political problem. It is a moral problem. The Trump tax plan is designed to increase inequality, to increase social inequality, and to increase the national debt. These are not economic problems, they are moral problems. They are not economic problems in the sense that they are not caused by a decline in demand for goods and services. They are moral problems because they threaten the quality of life for the majority of Americans.

The Trump tax plan is neither the best nor the only

Simply paying for the initiatives on his website and keeping the debt on its current unsustainable course would also require large cuts –
==================== COMPLETION 168 ====================
 perhaps totaling 70 percent, which is sufficient to bring the deficit below the mandated target.

If Mr. Trump's proposed cuts are implemented, the economic growth that would accompany the cuts would be negligible. The growth rate of the economy under Mr. Trump's policies would be a mere 1.5 percent, only marginally higher than the average growth rate under President Obama. Under Mr. Trump's plan, the economy would grow by 2.6 percent, not 3.3 percent, as projected under current law.6

In addition, Mr. Trump's policies would lead to a large increase in the debt, which would have a negative impact on the economy, as debt holds down the value of the dollar and makes imports more expensive. The debt increased by $603 billion under President Obama, and would have increased by $5.49 trillion under President Trump.7

Even if Mr. Trump's budgetary policies were enacted, the debt would still be on a path to exceeding 100 percent of GDP by 2026, dragging the economy down for years to come. During the first year, we estimate that the economy would lose $5.76 trillion due to the debt, which would be enough to reduce annual economic growth by nearly 1 percent. Under current law, the debt would reach this level by 2028.8

For financial markets, the most relevant side effect would be the prospect of large fiscal deficits, tremendously augmented by Mr. Trump's policies. The Federal Reserve would be forced to raise interest rates, which would significantly increase the cost of borrowing and likely lead to a recession.

The Committee's communication with markets will likely be limited to the normal "sound bite" style. The Federal Reserve is expected to provide more information about the new policies over the coming months. At this point, however, the market's first reaction will be to focus on the potential negative consequences of raising interest rates.

The federal government's debt will likely continue to increase as Mr. Trump's plans are implemented. As such, the federal government will continue to be a drag on economic growth and the dollar. In addition, the expansionary fiscal policy that Mr. Trump has proposed will not be able to eliminate the debt on a permanent basis.

Ultimately, the economic impact of Mr. Trump's plans and policies is not likely to be good or great. The net effect will be to leave the economy far worse off than under current law.<|endoftext|>A member of the conservative media has called for the prosecution of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, saying he should be charged with a crime for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"Apparently there is not a word of truth to what Trump says about Putin, and he should be charged with treason," conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said on his radio show Wednesday. "It's very clear he's more of an enabler and defender of Putin than he is an adversary. He just says anything to get elected."

"I wonder if he should be given a pardon by the president," Hewitt added.

Hewitt's comments come one day after the Republican nominee told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly that he had known Putin for a long time and was "very impressed" with the Russian president.

Trump has repeatedly called out President Obama for allegedly collaborating with the Russian government during the Democratic National Committee's 2016 presidential election campaign.

"I don't know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy – but some people know who really knocked the crap out of Hillary, including her husband," Trump said. "I don't know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy – but some people know who really knocked the crap out of Hillary, including her husband."

 and there. She had nearly half a bottle left when I first saw it and it was gone now in just a few drinks. I was impressed.

Silence again for a few more moments and then she started to say what I assumed she was wanting to say the entire time we shared that bench.

"I was a fairly successful saleswoman. My company was having a celebration in Orlando for some of the top sales people in the central Florida region that year. It was going to be a great weekend away and we were all looking forward to it. My husband and daughter were going to join me as soon as he got off work on that Thursday Night. He was a nurse in an emergency room. I'd been telling my husband to quit that damned job for years. It was too stressful for him and I was making enough money that he didn't have to work, but he loved it.

I was in Orlando to celebrate selling more pharmaceuticals than anybody else did that year for my company, at least in my region, when my phone rang. I ignored it because I didn't recognize the number. The same number then showed up almost immediately on my pager so I returned the call."

She looked ahead for a bit and made that

 face again.

"What was the number again?

"The number on my pager. It was a number I'd never called before and I recognized the caller. I knew who he was. I knew what was coming. I knew the answer to his question.

"I didn't know what he wanted.

"He said he was looking for a woman named Lisa. I told him how long it had been since I'd seen her. He said he was looking for someone who would sell him a lot of drugs. I told him I didn't have anyone who did that. He said he'd go to the local drugstore and find someone."

She paused for a moment, then continued.

"I told him I had a big house to sell drugs to and he said he'd get that. I told him I didn't have anyone to sell to him. He told me to call a friend of his and he'd pick up the drugs. He said he'd make sure they were all right. I said he'd be there in an hour. I didn't want to get his friend involved."

She looked out the window and said, "I remember the truck pulling up. He never showed up. I called the number and the woman answered. She told me he was waiting for me. I told her I didn't know who he was. She told me he was a doctor. I told her maybe he was a friend of a friend but I couldn't be sure. I said I'd get back to her. She never called back.

"I went to his office at the hospital. I asked him to show me his credentials. He didn't have them. I asked him where they were and he said, 'A doctor's office.' I went over to the office. It was empty. I walked inside and there was the man who had called me. He was standing in the doorway. I asked him where he was from. He told me he was from Canada. I told him I was from Florida and I asked him if he was a doctor. He said he worked in the hospital and he'd been called in to see a patient in the emergency room. He said he asked the patient's wife to come to the office and she showed up with a doctor.

"I asked him how much he was charging me and he said it was $500. I told him I didn't have that much and he told me to come back another day. I asked him again and he said he'd call me back. I decided not to go back to the office. I went home and called the woman from the drug store in Orlando. She said she knew who it was. She went over and he was there. It turned out he had a doctor's note. I went home that night and called him. He took my call. He said he'd be there for the next week."

The woman's voice was trembling a little as she spoke.

"He asked if I needed any help and I said no. He said he'd be there for the next week and that he would find someone else to do the deal. He told me he was not a big drug dealer, he couldn't handle that kind of volume, and if I was a big drug dealer I would have had someone to handle the volume.

"He was calling me for the first time to sell drugs. I told him I was not interested. He said he wanted to make sure I was not in pain. I told him I was not in pain. He said he would be there for the next week and he would get someone to do the deal. I told him I would get someone to do the deal but I

 statement. I then asked, "So you thought that was an overreaction?"

She nodded. "I definitely did. I thought it was a hoax. After all, I was going to be in the same city as the celebration and my husband was a nurse by trade. I thought maybe they were referring to a business dinner at some restaurant or something, and he didn't have to work. And I thought maybe there was some sort of problem, maybe he was sick, and I told him to cancel. But he didn't. And the next day I found out that he wasn't sick at all. The company called up and told me that they had hidden the wedding."

I had that feeling again. I was sorry to hear that. I wished she had been able to see it. I wished she had known about it.

"Orlando was a long ways from Tampa. I was in Florida, not central Florida. I was the only woman there. My husband was in the hospital. I couldn't fly back to Florida so I had no way to get home. I had to stay. My company was having a party at my apartment for the top sales people in the region, about three hundred people. They'd all been invited. And I was the only female in the party."

She trailed off. "My husband was a nurse and I was a salesperson. We had to fly back to Florida and get on the plane. We were both pretty excited about the fact that they put us on the plane together. We had no idea what was going to happen when we arrived."

I was beginning to feel sorry for her.

"But when we got there we were told to go directly to the reception. My husband took a cab and I took a cab. I couldn't take the cab because I was still a little shaken up from my phone conversation and I was having trouble with my memory. So we got to the party and went to the reception, and when we got there it was a surprise to us.

It was a surprise to everyone. They had us there. We were the only female there. I was sitting with the guys. My husband was sitting with the salespeople. I was sitting with the salespeople. I was the only woman there.

It was a surprise to everyone."

I was shocked.

"I was so angry. I was so embarrassed. I was so angry that I couldn't remember anything that I'd said. I've never had that happen to me before. I've been in sales for twenty-five years. I've never been the only woman at a party. I've never been the only woman at a party with my husband. So, I was just really embarrassed. I was really angry. I felt like they were taking advantage of me.

I couldn't remember who I'd spoken to on my pager. I couldn't remember anything that I'd said at all. I was so angry. And I wanted to go home. I wanted to get back home to my husband and my daughter. I wanted to get off that plane. I wanted to get home. I wanted to go back to Florida."

"I felt like I had to tell the story. I wanted to make sure that it wasn't my fault that he quit. I wanted to make sure it wasn't my fault that he was sick. I wanted the company to apologize. I wanted the company to tell us it was a mistake. But they didn't do that. They said that they did it to protect us.

The CEO of their company was there that night. He told us that people were saying that we were the cause of the mistake. He said that

 face like she was going to cry. I could tell she was a little upset.

"It was a dispatcher, asking me to drive to the hotel that Saturday night. It was a house party and I was gonna do a couple of cocktails at one of the bars and where I was staying. I was going to meet my husband and daughter and then we were going to party all night and then have a night of dinner.

I didn't have any alcohol on me when I got on the phone. I thought about what I was going to tell him. I couldn't tell him about the pager. I was going to tell him about all the people on it. I was going to tell him that I was having too much fun with my company all weekend and then that the company was going to celebrate by having drinks and dinner. I was going to tell him that I was going to leave work early, to avoid the traffic and then I was going to drive to the hotel. I was going to tell him about the party. I was going to tell him that I didn't have any more alcohol.

I told him that I was going to call him back, that I'd talk to him later. I hung up."

I then asked her if she felt guilty about what she had done.

"No. I don't feel guilty at all. I feel terrible about what I did. If I could go back in time, I would change it."

I asked her what her immediate plan was. She said that she was going to get up and leave. That she'd be leaving that weekend and that she was really going to have too much fun.

"I just want to go home. I just want to go home. I don't want to leave my family. I just want to go home. I want to just get out of here. I want to get home. I don't want to go back."

I asked her if she had any idea what she was getting into.

She said that she had been getting calls for months about the party and she had been afraid to do it and that she just didn't feel like she could handle it.

"I just wanted to go home. I just wanted to go home. I don't feel like I can handle this, this party. I don't feel like I can handle it."

She said that when she got home she was going to cry about what happened. She said that she had to go to work and that she couldn't just sit around. She said that she had to leave.

"I don't feel like I can handle the fact that I went out and I made a mistake. I really screwed up. I made a really bad mistake. I'm going to live with this for the rest of my life. It's going to be something I have to live with. I'm not going to be able to live my life the way I want to live my life unless I come back and apologize. You know, I'm not going to say that I'm sorry."

I asked her if she was going to get the same job next week.

"No, I'm not. I'm not going to work for that company. I'm going to find a different job. I'm not going to work for that company."

I asked her if she was going to tell her husband what had happened.

"No, I'm not going to tell him about that. I don't want to ruin my marriage. I don't want to keep it a secret anymore. I don't want to ruin my marriage."

 face again. "This is the second time in a week that I have been told to come back to the hospital. The first time, I was transferred to the burn unit. The second time, I was told it was for treatment of a chest infection. I was told that I could have the pneumonia. I've been feeling pretty miserable ever since. People keep trying to get me to go back to work. My boss has been telling me that I've been doing a great job, but it's so hard to get all of this attention from my patients when I'm in the hospital. I don't have the time to go out, to get out of the house, to go to the movies or even to go to the grocery store. When I'm sick, I'm sick. And I'm afraid to go back to work. I know I'm not doing a good enough job to keep it. I'm not even making any money."

She looked at me and I sat there for a moment and really listened until she started to tell me about her husband and daughter. I was startled by how emotional she was talking about it all. I was shocked by how she was holding herself and her daughter.

She then paused and I sat there a moment, trying to figure out how to tell her good news. I wish I had thought of that beforehand and not choked her on the truth of the situation.

She went on to tell me about how her husband and daughter both work. They both live in other states and she was doing the best she could for them. She said that her husband was laid off from his job because they weren't doing as well as they could be in the area. She said that his company had tried to lay him off several times in the past to no avail, but that it was a business and they just had to go with the flow. She said that she knew that they were doing their best and that they were worth more than the money they were making. She said that she didn't want to be the one to tell them it was time to go, but that she would have to.

I could tell by her expression that she had just been through a great deal, but she was trying to keep it together for me, so I didn't push too hard. She went on to tell me that she had told her husband that he needed to take her out of the hospital so that she could go home and spend time with her daughter. She said that he was getting a bit upset that she was going without. She knew how much he loved her and that he would do anything for her. She said that she knew he was going to be there for her eventually, but that she didn't want to lose him and her daughter too quickly.

I couldn't help but think that it was the nicest thing anyone could have ever said to her. I just kept telling her that she was doing a great job, that she was great at what she did, and that she was a great mother to her daughter. I told her that she was the best that I had ever known.

I sat there for a moment and then said that it was time for me to go.

She said that she wanted me to take her back to the hospital to remember her at least once. I told her that I would. I hugged her and told her that I loved her and that I would always be there to help her. She cried for a moment and then just smiled and said that it was okay, that she just needed to get home to her daughter.

Then I left.

I called the nursing home that was the target of the attack. They had no idea what had happened. I called the hospital as well

"It was a surprise to me and for the whole team too, I think. I'm sorry he's gone because we've lost a point of reference for the team and I just hope he's taken the right decision," Ferrari said diplomatically.

Cavendish's efforts to sign Petacchi as a lead-out man – and Petacchi revealed that he already made informal enquiries last season – are a clear sign that all is not flowing as smoothly in the Omega Pharma-QuickStep sprint train as the Manxman would like, even if his haul of seven wins so far this season has offset its significance.

"It's certainly harder for him to do sprints without a team and I think this is a weak point for him," Ferrari said. "So we'll try and take advantage of that too."

By contrast, Ferrari is left to his own devices in the sprints and outside of his five or so sprint opportunities, the Brescia native must spend his days sheltering team leader Michele Scarponi from the wind and piloting him through the peloton.

"I have to manage the sprints by myself but that's only right because we've got a team here to try and put Scarponi
==================== COMPLETION 173 ====================
 in the best position to win the race," Ferrari said. "If I start to care too much about the sprints it's not going to be a good day for me. I've got to look after the team and the team has got to look after me, so we're both on the same page."

While Ferrari's role as a team leader may make him more cautious than some, it also makes him more open to criticism, as the team's focus is on winning the race and his own Superprestige High5 team has had a poor start to the season.

"I can't be more open than I am," he said. "Everybody is free to do what they want. I'm not going to say that I'm the best sprinter in the world or that I'm not the best sprinter in the world, but I am the best sprinter in the team.

"So I feel like I have to be there to help everyone and I try to do that. But I'm not going to say I'm going to put pressure on myself or expect others to do the same.

"Like I said, I am fully in charge of the team. So I can't say that I'm the best sprinter in the world or the best sprinter in the team, and that's fine. I'm just going to do what I feel I need to do to help the team win races."

Ferrari was asked whether he felt he was the best sprinter in the world in the past and he replied: "I think I am."

"I think that I am the best sprinter in the World Cup," he said, before adding: "Did I train by myself for three years? Did I train by myself for three years? No, but I have the same team around me, and I give my all too."

Ferrari has also taken part in a number of sprints himself but it's his role as a lead-out man that makes him so important.

"It's a little bit like the car that you drive," Ferrari said. "You have to drive it carefully and you have to have the chance to take the wheel. It's a little bit like that.

"I feel like I've got to be there for Michele Scarponi and for Tiesj Benoot and for Vincenzo Nibali and for Alberto Contador and for other riders.

"But I'm not going to try to be the best and I'm not going to say that I'm going to be the best, so I have to be there to give my all and help the team win races. I'm not going to try to be the best, that's not my job.

"I'm just going to be there to do my job and be there to support the team and give my all. I have to do my job and I have to be there to support the team."

Ferrari was also asked if he felt he had the same quality as his teammate Nibali in his sprinting abilities.

"I think I have the same quality as Nibali in that I can carry the ball," he said. "I think I can be a little bit more aggressive than him because I can certainly do it.

"That's what I can do. I can carry the ball. I can move up and down the field and I can take advantage of that. I don't know how big the advantage is, but I can do it."

"It was a surprise to me and for the whole team too, I think. I'm sorry he's gone because we've lost a point of reference for the team and I just hope he's taken the right decision," Ferrari said diplomatically.

Cavendish's efforts to sign Petacchi as a lead-out man – and Petacchi revealed that he already made informal enquiries last season – are a clear sign that all is not flowing as smoothly in the Omega Pharma-QuickStep sprint train as the Manxman would like, even if his haul of seven wins so far this season has offset its significance.

"It's certainly harder for him to do sprints without a team and I think this is a weak point for him," Ferrari said. "So we'll try and take advantage of that too."

By contrast, Ferrari is left to his own devices in the sprints and outside of his five or so sprint opportunities, the Brescia native must spend his days sheltering team leader Michele Scarponi from the wind and piloting him through the peloton.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has accepted a 125-acre parcel in Mesquite for the new Mormon temple, President Russell Ballard said Wednesday.

The church spent $6 million renovating the former home of a polygamist sect in the 1990s.

The Deseret News reports (http://bit.ly/2jKGYLX ) that church leaders began meeting in early November to discuss the new temple site and began seeking land from other church members.

The site is about one-half mile from the Mormon temple in downtown Salt Lake City.

LDS spokeswoman Kristen Howey said the church will build the new temple at a site in the Navajo Nation.

Information from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com<|endoftext|>We told you yesterday that we'd be getting a new t-shirt from Mattel. It's from the "Hercules" movie, and it's made of a T-shirt that is, unsurprisingly, about Hercules. And it's awesome. Think of it as the next step in the evolution of t-shirts, and we're totally on board.

As you can see from the picture above, the shirt comes with a "Herc " logo on the front, and "The Rock" on the back. I don't know about you, but this is one of the coolest things I've seen in a while.

The "Rock" logo is made of the American flag, and it's a gold star with "South" written on it. The American flag, of course, is made of cotton.

The "Herc" logo, on the other hand, is made of a t-shirt. I know, I know, that doesn't make sense. But look at it this way: The American flag is made of cotton, but the "Herc" logo is made of a t-shirt. So, to me, this makes a little more sense.

So, give it a look. It's available now at Mattel.com for $22.99 (unisex size).

The GT40 was an all-out beast of a car, and had a 1,000 hp V8 engine, which was capable of accelerating to 60 mph in just 3.8 seconds. It had a mere 2,700 pounds to haul around, so it was pretty fast.

The GT40 was produced in three generations, the first of which was the GT40GTS, which was powered by a 1,000 hp V8 that was accompanied by a 5-speed manual transmission. The second generation GT40 was the GT40R, which had a more aggressive body style and was powered by a 2,525-pound, 5-speed manual transmission and automatic transmission. The third generation was the GT40GT, which featured a 355-horsepower, 4-cylinder engine and a 5-speed manual transmission.

The GT40 was a truly exotic car, and although it's been out of production for many years, the car is still a collector's item. If you're interested in getting your hands on one, this article is for you.

Are You Ready for the GT40?

Let's start with the performance numbers of the GT40. The GT40 was a very powerful car, and it was capable of reaching speeds of over 200 mph. The car was also incredibly light, weighing just 2,700 pounds.

The GT40 was capable of reaching 60 mph in just 3.8 seconds, which is a pretty good time for a car of that size. This made the GT40 extremely fast, and while it wasn't the fastest car in the world, it was certainly one of the fastest sports cars.

The GT40 was one of the first cars to have a flat-plane crank engine. Flat-plane cranks require less work to rotate, so they are much lighter and produce less friction. The GT40 also featured a six-speed manual transmission, which was great for making long trips, but it was not terribly fast.

Despite the fact that the GT40 was very fast, Toyota decided to give the GT40 a more conservative powertrain. The GT40R had a 2,525-pound, 5-speed manual transmission, but it was not as powerful as the 2,700-pound GT40GTS. The GT40GT, on the other hand, had a 355-horsepower, 4-cylinder engine with a 5-speed manual transmission.

Why is the GT40 so Special?

There are many reasons why the GT40 is so special. First of all, it was a car that was driven to be as fast as it possibly could be. The GT40 was a car that was driven as hard as it possibly could be, and it made a statement.

The second reason that the GT40 is so special is because of its styling. The GT40

I have been looking forward to this for a long time, and I'm so happy with the results! I took this picture on my cell phone, but I'm pretty sure that's not the best camera I have.

I chose a black and white version of the pattern so that it wouldn't look too busy in the picture. If you want to dye your yarn, you can dye it with any non-solvent dyeing agent you like.

I'm happy with the way it turned out, and I'm happy with the way it will look once I'm finished!

I used two balls of Queen Bee Fiber Arts Meep Horns in the base color. I used the worsted weight yarn to make the horn. I had an extra ball of the worsted weight yarn, so I used that instead. I used a #4 hook to complete this piece.

I'm so excited to share this pattern with you! I made this along with my friend, Emily, which you can read about here. I'm also excited to share the pattern with you because it's my first time working with a crochet hook, and I'm really happy with the results!

This article is part of a series on the impact of the war on terror on the world. You can read other articles in this series by clicking on the links below. To read the rest of this series, click here.

In my first article for TomDispatch, I explained how the war on terror, with its hollowed-out states, its militarized police forces, its drone assassination campaigns, and its agents of the state, has proved to be a losing game. But I also noted that the legacy of the "war on terror" was making a comeback. The United States was drawing new blood, and drawing it from a massive swath of the world.

That is a theme I will return to today. The U.S. military is now engaged in a second global war, with the world's most populous state, China, as its battleground. It is a "revisionist" war in which America's real enemies are not al-Qaeda and its global network, but China and its neighbors. Indeed, America's enemies are now not merely the various terrorist organizations that it has recently targeted, but China and its neighbors as well.

This has come as a surprise to many Americans, a surprise that is compounded by the fact that the "global war on terror" has largely been a failure in the eyes of most Americans. The New York Times recently noted that the "main enemy is not al Qaeda, but China." A recent Pew Research survey noted that only 33% of Americans view the war on terror as a success, the lowest percentage since the end of the Cold War, while a staggering 61% believe that the war on terror has been a failure. In the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, a majority in the U.S. agreed with the statement, "We've had a war on terror, but it's backfiring against us."

Please be aware that the vests MUST be carried in the 'passenger cell' of the vehicle, so they can be put on before you get out of the vehicle. Do NOT store them in the boot under all your holiday luggage!


Q: Do we need High-Viz vests for all countries in Europe?


A: Legislation is constantly changing in Europe with more and more countries adopting vests as a legal requirement. The countries that require you to have reflective vests are currently, France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Austria.


Q: Is it law to have a fire extinguisher?


A: Yes - In some countries. However, above all it is strongly recommended - as the European 'Good Samaritan' clause means that all motorists are obliged to stop and lend assistance in the event of an incident. Clearly, the carrying of a fire extinguisher to help in such situations is strongly advisable.


Q: Do you have to have a first aid kit?


A: The position for first aid kits is the same as fire extinguishers - please see above. [Top]

Magnetic Plates


Q: Do you have to fit a GB plate if you have a GB
==================== COMPLETION 177 ====================
 car?


A: The law in the UK is very clear - you must have an internationally compliant plate in order to comply with the requirements of the Road Traffic Act (RTA). Unfortunately the law is not the same in a number of other countries. In this particular instance, it is recommended that you always carry the same plate in all countries, as requirements can change at any time.


Q: Can I get a magnetic fob?


A: Yes, but to do this you will need a UK 'UK' fob. You can buy a UK 'UK' fob from the 'Wrap-Around' or 'Carry-On' section of any car hire company. [Top]

Checking the Vehicle


Q: Is the vehicle properly checked?


A: If the vehicle is a new car, the vehicle itself is checked thoroughly. If it is a used car, you will be asked to inspect it in person before a hire company will arrange for a mechanic to look at it.


Q: What is the registration number?


A: It is the vehicle's registration number. It is normally stamped on the back of the vehicle.


Q: Where can I find the registration number for my car?


A: The registration number can be found on the vehicle's V5C Notice of Registration. The V5C Notice of Registration is the vehicle's registration card, which is also known as a form two.


Q: Is the vehicle insured?


A: If the vehicle is registered in the UK, it is insured by the British Insurance Brokers' Association (BIBA) or the RAA. If the vehicle is not registered in the UK, you will need to get an independent quote for comprehensive car insurance before you hire it.

Q: What is a 'scratcher'?


A: A 'scratcher' is a tool which is used to remove any debris that has collected on the vehicle's bodywork. It is used to even out the spacing between wheels and to even out bodywork gaps. When used properly, it is a useful tool but a large amount of debris can be removed from a vehicle without the use of a scraper.


Q: What are the differences between a scraper and a scraper brush?


A: A scraper is a device that is used to remove any debris from the vehicle's bodywork. It is used to even out the spacing between wheels and to even out bodywork gaps. The problem with a scraper is that it is only effective in removing debris from the bodywork. For this reason, a scraper brush is used to remove debris from the bodywork, and is effective in removing debris from the vehicle.


Q: What are the different types of bodywork?


A: The bodywork on your car will be arranged in a specific way based on the type of vehicle. The following types of bodywork are used in each type of vehicle.

Cary, in a phone interview Saturday with The Washington Post, said he had gone to the rally because he wanted to hand-deliver a note to the Republican presidential nominee. He made his way to about 20 to 30 feet from the stage and was shouting "Donald!" while waving his note around to try to catch his attention.

"Everyone else is waving Trump signs and I'm waving this white letter," Cary, 63, said. He said that,
==================== COMPLETION 181 ====================
 when he yelled, "Donald Trump, listen to me!" onto the microphone, it was "like the film Groundhog Day."

Cary said he was wearing a Donald Trump T-shirt, and that he also had a Trump sign in the back pocket of his jacket.

"I have been with Trump for a long time, and I have never seen anything like this," Cary said of the incident. "This is something that I never imagined would happen in my lifetime."

Cary said he wasn't physically hurt by the incident, but that it left him "upset."

"I've never experienced anything like this," he said. "This is not the person I know. I've never seen him angry like this."

"I know he is a good man," Cary told the Post.

Cary did not file a complaint with authorities.

Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks declined to comment on the incident to The Post.

Cary said that Trump's campaign did not respond to his letter.

The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Cary said that his letter was not intended to be a presidential endorsement, and that he is neither of those things.

"I wanted to hand-deliver a note to him as a representative of people like me," Cary said. "I'm not a candidate for anything. I'm not a Republican or anything. I'm a regular guy, and I'm just a regular guy who's upset with what's going on in this country."

Cary said he was angry because he saw "a lot of things that are not right" in the presidential race, specifically with Trump's rhetoric.

"I'm a regular guy with a regular job," Cary said. "I'm just not happy with what's going on in the country right now. And I just want to express that. ... I'm not a politician. I'm not a politician's son. I'm a regular guy, and this is my way of expressing that."

Cary said the incident was "entirely consensual."<|endoftext|>The Inland Revenue Service (IRD) has made a decision to take action against an Australian bank, following a complaint from a man who claimed that he had been wrongly charged six times in one month for a credit card that he never used.

In December, the Manly-based Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) was fined $11.4 million for its failure to alert its customers to the risk of being charged for credit cards that they never used.

The IRD has now decided to pursue the bank to recover the money it has already paid out.

In a statement, the IRD said: "The IRD has been made aware of a complaint regarding the CBA Credit Card and has initiated an investigation into the matter.

"The IRD will be seeking to recover the amounts recovered within the timeframes set out in the court order and in accordance with the IRD's other actions in this matter. The IRD's compliance with its legal responsibilities is its highest priority."

The IRD said it was aware of a 65-year-old man in Sydney's south-west who made a complaint in May 2013.

It is alleged that he was charged more than $1800 for a credit card with a limit of $200.

The man said he was told he had been incorrectly charged twice when he first tried to use the card.

The bank then charged another $200.

The man is now seeking $70,000 in compensation for the money he has already spent fighting the bank.

CBA told the ABC it had received the complaint in

 as the rally was wrapping up, Trump came over and introduced himself.

"It was like a handshake," he said. "He said, 'I got your note. I'm going to read it to you. But you can read it to me right now if you want.'"

Cary said he was so taken aback by the encounter that he began shaking uncontrollably. He said he asked Trump about it, and that Trump told him the man had been ejected because he was a Trump supporter. Cary said he assumed that the man had been ejected because he was a Trump protester.

Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed that the man was ejected from the rally but declined to comment on Cary's account. Cary said he was still planning to attend the rally.

Cary said he had been traveling to the rally before it began, and he said he had been told by police that they would be keeping an eye on the crowd.

"I'm sure he'll be back in the crowd before I even start speaking," Cary said.

Cary said he did not hear Trump answer his note, and that he left the rally without it.

[US cable news anchors show no inclination to challenge Trump]

The man who was ejected from the rally, who had been holding a sign that read "Trump Tires Are for Fags," told Raleigh's WRAL that he was at the rally to support Trump's stance on immigration.

"I'm not a protester," he said.

He said he was not a Trump supporter, but felt the candidate's stance on immigration was right.

"I happen to believe that we need more immigration," he said.

"It's just a matter of what country you're from," he added.

Trump has also been criticized for inciting violence at his rallies.

After the violence at a rally in Chicago on Friday, Trump said in a statement on Saturday that "violence at my rallies is a big problem for this country."

"I condemn it," Trump said. "I condemn it."

In his remarks Saturday, Trump said "many people" were involved in the Chicago violence and that "the rally was totally safe."

"I have to tell you there were people that were rough," Trump said, referring to the protesters and Trump supporters. "They were rough, and they were nasty.

"But I will tell you this, there was tremendous love in the room. The room was packed, not packed but you could see it. There was love in the room," he said.

He added: "This is what we need in our country. This is what is going to happen if we don't get it done."

Cary, who was wearing a Trump sweatshirt, said he had known Trump for about 20 years and was familiar with his stances on immigration and public education. He said he also knew about the man who was ejected from the rally, although Cary said he did not know the man's name, only that he was ejected from the rally for being a Trump supporter.

Cary, who is from Rowan County, N.C., said he was a registered Democrat. But he said he had decided to vote for Trump because he did not think the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, was qualified to be president.

"I feel that the country's in a desperate situation right now," Cary said. "Hillary Clinton's policies are going to put us right back in that situation."

Cary said he had voted for Obama twice, but that he had always voted Republican.

As a consequence, Cary said he was hesitant to support Trump, and was not sure if he would continue to

 when he first saw Trump, "I was just like, 'Oh my God. It looks like he is going to win.' I was thinking he was going to win. I was like, 'Oh my God, this is great.' "

Cary said he was "surprised" when he saw the man Trump was speaking to. "I was like, 'Oh my God, he is walking right up to him,' " he said. "I was like, 'Oh my God, this is crazy.' "

"He wasn't asking for anything," Cary added. "He was just standing there waving his hand. He was not asking for anything. He was just standing there. I kept thinking to myself, 'F—, this is horrible.' "

Cary said he was walking away about five minutes before Trump bought a microphone.

"I didn't want to be there anymore," Cary said. "I just wanted to go home."

He said he'd like to give his note to Trump but that he doesn't have the time to do it Tuesday night.

Cary said he had never heard of Trump's wife, Melania, and didn't think she was at the rally because, he said, she was wearing a black jacket.

Cary said he believed Trump "could not be elected president" but that it could be possible that a "Trump supporter" could be elected, such as former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.

Cary said he has no reason to believe that Melania Trump was at the rally.

"I don't think she was wearing anything," he said. "I don't know the person she was talking to because I was not in the room. I just know that she was not wearing anything."

Cary said he has never heard about Trump's wife being vulgar or crude.

"I don't think that she was at all like that," he said. "It would have been very odd for her to be like that."

Cary said he had been "thrilled" by what he'd seen from Trump in his life.

"I was honestly excited," he said. "I really am excited about him. I've been a Trump supporter since I was a little kid. I have been thinking about him for the last 20 years. I have been a fan of his for a long time. I think he's going to be great for America."

Cary said he had been "flattered" by the attention the incident had received online.

"I've been doing this for 21 years," he said. "I've never seen anything like this in my life. I've never seen anything like this in my life."

Cary said he was surprised at the incident because he thought that there was "no way" Trump's security would allow a man to get close to the candidate. Cary said he had been "surprised" that Trump's campaign had let him through security.

"I was shocked," he said. "I was shocked. I was shocked. I was shocked."

Cary said he was also surprised by the media presence at the event.

"I was like, 'Oh, my God, this is insane,' " he said. "I was stunned. I was stunned. I was stunned. I was stunned."

Cary said that one of his friends had told him that "Trump supporters were very aggressive and were very vocal." Cary said that he had never seen an event like Tuesday's.

"It was a total surprise," he said. "I've never seen anything like this in my life."

 when he got within about 10 feet of the stage, Trump's security detail grabbed him by the arm and got him out of the building. Cary said it was "a little weird" that he was being ejected from the rally but that he wasn't trying to disrupt it — he was just trying to hand-deliver the note.

"I was just trying to make a political statement," Cary said. "I was trying to get him to look at the note."

He said he was escorted out of the building because his actions were a threat to the safety of the rally attendees.

"I was just trying to get a response," Cary said. "I wasn't trying to disrupt the rally or anything — I think they could have handled it better."

He added: "I'm a Republican, I'm a loyalist. I believe in Mr. Trump 100 percent. This is my home, this is my state, this is my country. If you are going to throw me out of my home, this is what you should do."

Cary said he had a copy of Trump's convention acceptance speech in his hand — which he said was the "best speech of the convention" — and had the note in front of him.

Hours after the incident, Cary posted about it on Facebook and wrote, "I'm not a villain, I'm not a criminal, I'm not a Bernie supporter, I'm a Trump supporter, I'm a patriot. I'm a true AMERICAN!"

Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to a request for comment.

Cary said he plans to attend the next rally in North Carolina.

Not everyone at the rally was offended by Cary's actions.

"Everyone has their own way of expressing their opinion," said Jennifer Korn, the host of a radio show and a Trump supporter. "I'm all for free speech."

Spencer Wagner, a Trump supporter who was at the rally, said Cary's actions were "absolutely pathetic."

"This is what happens when you let the left run the country," Wagner said. "Their allegiance is to the left, not to the people."

Cary, who was wearing a Trump shirt, said he was kicked out because he was "an asshole" and because he was being "a real jerk." He said he has been to several Trump rallies and that he has never been kicked out.

"I'm a loyal guy," he said. "I've got a family, I've got kids. I've got a mortgage. I'm not going to just go away. I am going to be here all week."

Cary said he plans to attend the next rally in North Carolina.

Tech companies including Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Microsoft have filed a federal lawsuit challenging the ban. Their statement follows shortly after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey said they would close their companies to employees from seven Muslim-majority countries.

"We are deeply troubled by the recent executive orders signed by President Trump," the companies said in a joint statement. "The recent executive orders have created uncertainty for our employees, customers, and partners around the world.

Mr Brown said that he believed the country could see a further 500,000 jobs being created over the next ten years if Britain stayed in Europe, in the digital economy and in renewable energy.

However, he also focused on far more than the economic case against Brexit.

And he insisted that the EU which had historically helped to introduce protection for workers was vital to continue to promote workers' rights in the future.

He claimed that a Britain within Europe ought to be fighting to tackle the problem of zero-hours contracts, which he said could not be done without international cooperation.

And he said that, without Europe, Conservative governments would have refused to offer workers the protections they currently enjoy.

"We have to take our own decisions as a sovereign nation and I think this is a good time for the British people to make a decision about their future in Europe," he said.

"A lot of people are saying in the past that Britain will be a better place if we leave Europe, but we have to understand that we are not leaving Europe," he said.

"I honestly believe that if we leave Europe we will be a better place in terms of jobs, a better place in terms of innovation, a better place in terms of our ability to protect our workers, our trade, our service industries."

Mr Brown said that he believed that some of the issues that people in campaign to leave the European Union were worried about - such as immigration - could not be solved within the EU.

"The EU is not the answer to immigration, it's not the answer to the problems of the eurozone and it's not the answer to the problems of the Single Market," he said.

"Anybody who thinks that the EU is the answer to all our problems is fooling themselves."

The former premier said that the EU was a "good institution" and he hoped that people would continue to work with it in the future.

"I am convinced that the EU is a good institution and that it can still be a good institution, but I am also convinced that the future of the European Union is in Europe," he said.

"I think that what is happening in Britain is a very, very healthy sign for Europe and I hope that the British people will continue to be part of that European Union and that we will continue to be part of the European Single Market."<|endoftext|>AIM:

The purpose of this study was to investigate the cardiac autonomic regulation in rats with chronic exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and to study the mechanisms of the increased heart rate.

METHODS:

MPTP-exposed rats were exposed to a single administration of the drug (1 mg/kg, s.c.) or a single administration of the drug (1 mg/kg, t.i.) followed by a 2-h recovery period. The rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Arterial blood flow was measured by hematocrit determinations and the ventricles were exposed to different intensities of isoflurane, and the electrical activity of the heart was monitored by recording the activity of the ventricular myosin light chain.

RESULTS:

MPTP-exposed rats exhibited a significant increase in heart rate (0.09 +/- 0.02 BPM) during the 2-h recovery period. In addition, the electrical activity of the heart was increased after the administration of MPTP and the cardiac myosin light chain during the 2-h recovery period.

CONCLUSION:

MPTP-induced cardiac autonomic regulation is associated with the increase of the electrical activity of the ventricular myosin light chain in rats with chronic exposure to MPTP.<|endoftext|>The FBI needs to be held accountable for its failure to protect America's most precious asset: our children.

He also argued that the UK was the "leading" country in the EU in terms of exports to the rest of the world and that this was a significant growth area for the UK.

Some health problems are associated with puppy mills:


-Egg and bone mites

-Euthanization (lethal injection)

-Sick puppy syndrome

-Puppies with malformed limbs

-Puppies that are not socialized or not allowed to play

The Galaxy S3 is the last version of the Galaxy S series, as Samsung is focused on releasing the Galaxy S5 next year. It will be a good time for other Galaxy users to pick up a Galaxy S3, as the Galaxy S4 is still available for purchase.

Samsung Galaxy S3 (SM-G900A)

The Samsung Galaxy S3 has been around for a couple of years, and it has been a great phone, even if it wasn't the best in the world. The S3 is a great phone for most people, but for a few people, it didn't deliver all the features they were looking for.

The Galaxy S3 is powered by a 2.3 GHz quad-core processor and it has supported microSD cards up to 64 GB. The Galaxy S3 comes with a 5-inch WVGA display and it is said to have a Quad HD resolution. The Samsung Galaxy S3 supports LTE and Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac. The Galaxy S3 also supports microUSB 2.0, so it is compatible with U.S. and European Power Banks.

The Samsung Galaxy S3 also has a 12 MP rear camera, and it supports 4K video recording. It also has a heart rate monitor, and Samsung has included the S Health app. The Galaxy S3 is made of metal and it has a removable battery. It also has a microSD card slot, so users can expand its storage using a microSD card.

All the Galaxy S 3 variants will be discontinued, and Samsung will no longer make Galaxy S 3 devices. The Galaxy S5 is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2014.<|endoftext|>In this review, we

The former Labour leader said he wanted to set out a "positive" case for staying
==================== COMPLETION 187 ====================
 in Europe, but warned that he and the party would not be able to deliver that if Britain voted to leave.

He said: "But I think it's worth making a positive case for staying in Europe, because it is in our interests to stay in Europe.

"The European Union has been a force for good, not just for Britain, but for Europe and not just for the people who live and work in Europe, but for the people who live and work in the countries that are the heart of Europe, which are Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden.

"And if we leave Europe, if Europe leaves Europe, I fear that we will see less of those positive, worthwhile, progressive impulses across Europe, and we will see a more ugly, negative, negative outlook."

Mr Brown told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: "I think that the idea of leaving Europe would, in the next 10 years, mean that the whole of Europe would be in the same boat as us."

He said that he believed there could be "a further 500,000 jobs" being created in the digital economy and in renewable energy over the next 10 years, and that otherwise Britain would face significant job losses, especially in certain sectors.

But Mr Brown said that the government had to be "very cautious" about the impact of the decision, because it would have the effect of "hollowing out" parts of the economy.

He also said that the businesses that would be hit the most by the decision were small companies, and said that the UK's greatest strength was its "freedom of markets".

He said: "It's a great strength of ours that we are free to run our own economy, to run our own trade and business policies, and to run our own tax system, and in a sense that is our single market."

But he said that Europe had recently been "hit by the worst recession since the 1930s", and that the EU had had to "dance to the tune of the rest of the world".

He said: "We have to look at the issue of the single market and the free movement of people, because those two things are inextricably linked.

"If you start to go down the road of forcing the free movement of people, you will not only hit the European economy in terms of jobs, but you will hit the British economy as well."

He also warned that if the UK voted to leave the EU, it would be "more difficult to solve the problems we have in this country, particularly in terms of immigration".

Mr Brown said that he had written to Theresa May before the 2015 general election to explain his views on Brexit, and that she had accepted his advice.

He said: "And I think that in the last two months, there has been a massive change in the political debate.

"People have started to talk about how to deal with immigration, people have started to talk about the European Union being more important than the UK in terms of trade and jobs, and in a sense that is very worrying.

"I don't think that's what most people want to hear, but that is what they have heard from the Prime Minister.

"I don't think the Prime Minister understands that most people do want to have a country which is open, which is outward looking, which is confident in its own identity, and that is what we need to retain."

Mr Brown said he believed that there was a role for immigration in the UK economy, especially in areas of low unemployment, but that it must be controlled and managed by the government.

"I think we have to be very careful about what

 in the EU, arguing that the Conservatives had nothing to fear from Brexit and that the country would be free to forge its own economic future.

He said: "The argument for staying in is that if we leave the EU, we will leave the EU and the world will move on.

"It is a positive argument because if it were to work, we would be able to take our own decisions about the way we do things and we would be building a more effective, more socially just and more prosperous Britain for ourselves and for our children.

"If that is the case, we should stay in."

But Mr Brown said that the country would have to move away from the neoliberal model of the past decade if it was to thrive in the future.

He said: "It's a mistake to say that Britain is better off as a low-tax, low-regulation, low-immigration, low-welfare, high-investment country.

"That's not how we work.

"Britain is a low-tax, low-regulation, low-welfare country that is better off in a changing world.

It is a tale of two men.

One is a man who was caught trying to smuggle a deadly poison into Canada.

The other is a man who is currently free after being caught trying to smuggle a deadly poison into Canada.

The story begins in the summer of 2001 when Canadian customs officers stopped a man at Pearson International Airport in Ontario.

The man - a Kuwaiti-born Canadian citizen - was carrying a container containing a drug called sarin gas.

The man was intercepted while attempting to enter Canada at Pearson International Airport in Ontario

The man was taken to the Canadian Border Services Agency.

After a lengthy investigation into the man's activities, police arrested him for the attempted smuggling of sarin gas.

The man, who has not been named, was not charged.

Instead, authorities put him on a plane to Kuwait and deported him.

But in October 2002 he was trying to smuggle sarin gas into Canada - and was arrested at Toronto's Pearson Airport.

The man was jailed for five years.

Then in November 2004, he was found to have a mobile phone in his possession.

It contained information that was being used to supply sarin gas to terrorist cells in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The man was sentenced to 17 years in jail.

He was released in 2003 and now lives in Kuwait

But in January 2005, the man was again trying to get in to Canada - but this time with a deadly and deadly poison.

This time the man was caught attempting to bring 2.5 grammes of cyanide into Canada by mail.

At the time, the man was given a seven year prison sentence.

But in April 2005, a judge in Toronto ordered that he be freed and allowed to return to Kuwait.

The man was released in April 2005 and now live in Kuwait

It was not clear whether the man had been arrested again.

However, last night, a Canadian court heard that the man had been arrested again.

The man was arrested in the United Arab Emirates in March 2007 and was facing additional charges.

He was released in September 2007 and has not been arrested again.

The study, done by researchers at the Alcohol Research Group at Columbia University, found that 6.8 percent of young people between the ages of 13 and 17 had tried marijuana at least once. Of those, 41 percent said they believed they had a high tolerance to the drug, and 25 percent said they thought the drug made them feel "high."

The findings come as a growing number of states have legalized pot and the drug has become increasingly popular among youths. In March, the Drug Enforcement Administration said it would no longer classify marijuana as a Schedule I drug, the designation reserved for the most dangerous drugs — with a high potential for abuse and no medical value.

The study also found that of the young people who had tried marijuana in the past year, 60 percent had used it at least once in the preceding year.

"We're finding that this is a very common thing to have happen," said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. "The high tolerance is a sign of high tolerance to marijuana, which is a sign of high tolerance to marijuana."

The study was based on interviews with 1,262 students who participated in a national longitudinal survey of drug use that began in 1997. The researchers used a statistical model to determine the likelihood of high tolerance in the young people.

Dr. Volkow said it was important to note that the findings were based on a very small number of young people, and that more research is needed to determine whether marijuana use is linked to a high tolerance to other drugs.

"It may be that other drugs, like cocaine, lead to high tolerance to marijuana," she said.

% respectively . However, with this rise in rents, the vacancy rate has also climbed consistently over the same period. From its 20 11 low (of 0.96%) it has almost doubled (to 1.84%) as of the end of 2016. The fact is our local economy has not created high-paying jobs at a level that can fill these pricey Manhattan apartments.

Adding V alue

Coinciding with the climbing vacancy rate, was a rise in landlord concessions. Climbing steadily since 2013, by year-end 2016, they were found in 22% of new leases signed with our firm. At their peak in 2009, incentives were found in a full 52% of leases, but by 2013, only 7% included one. While their efficacy can be debated, building owners would much rather pay brokerage fees or offer a month - or more - of free rent to new tenants than lower their asking rent. These short-term inducements help building owners achieve long-term goals.

In addition, apartment seekers had more and more rental product to choose from as the ten-year period progressed. In 2007 , 2,355 newly-constructed rental units were brought to market in Manhattan below 96th Street. In comparison,
==================== COMPLETION 193 ====================
 by year-end 2016, that number had surged to 3,721 units at the lower end of the market.

The price of rent also soared. In 2007, the average rent for a three-bedroom apartment in Manhattan was $1,605 . By year-end 2016, that number had increased to $2,566 .

The Effect of Brokers

Brokers still play an important role in the rental market. While their numbers are declining (due to the economic downturn), approximately 70% of new Manhattan rental projects are being marketed to the broker market. New York City's rental market is still fueled by the broker-assisted construction boom.

Following the financial crisis, there was a massive correction in the apartment market, resulting in the loss of tens of thousands of existing apartments. Brokers were among those impacted. The number of brokers employed fell by 20% between 2007 and 2013, and the number of brokers and agents had decreased by another 20% by the end of 2015.

The vacancy rate reached an all-time high in 2014, reaching 1.72%. However, since then, it has declined to 1.64% as of the end of 2016.

Renters are now faced with a choice: either pay more and hope for something better in the future, or move to another area and take a risk, which may not pay off or even result in losing their current apartment.

No Longer Do They Know The Truth

With the increasing numbers of brokers in the building industry, we have been asked by our clients to educate them on the impact brokers have on the housing market. While it is true that brokers do play a role in the rental market, we have seen the impact that broker fees have on the overall market.

Brokers/agents are a part of the larger market. As such, whenever a vacancy arises, the brokers pay a premium to land it. For a building that has been on the market for a while, this premium can exceed 15% of the asking rent. In many cases, this premium is considered the "last kick" to get a unit up and running before the lease expires.

When this happens, building owners are left holding the bag. As a result, they have to raise rents to compensate for their broker's fee. This can mean that your rent goes up or down, depending on what the broker does. Depending on the market, there can be periods where the broker's fee is so high that the rent goes down.

In reality, we are seeing the most hyper-pricing in the Manhattan market. This is because the brokers are charging a premium to get their units on the market, which results in an oversupply of rental units.

Don't Worry, It's Not Your Fault

When you are looking for a new apartment, I suggest you focus on the actual apartment itself. The fact is that if you are looking to find a place to live, you are not going to be able to find it without looking around. If you are looking to avoid the broker fee, then you should have some idea of what you are looking for and where you can find it.

In closing, it's important to note that we are not blaming brokers for the rising rent. They are just doing what they have always been doing since the beginning of time.

Ultimately, we believe that building owners should not be able to exploit tenants. This is why we've been advocating for a Rent Guidelines Board, which would have the power to regulate the rent increase market, and would have the power to stop brokers from putting a premium on the rental market.

Bale-scale and Power-scale

Assuming a few more years of occupancy, the vacancy rate will have increased to 1.38%, almost double the current rate. The most common rent increase is the close-in rent, with the average increasing by about 6.7% from the lowest rent to the highest. The greatest increases are found in the $1,250,000 / mo. range, where the average rent jumped by over 18%.

The Landlords

There is a common misconception that, as apartments become more expensive, everyone must move out. In reality, the opposite is true. As rents rise, so do the rent payments of our existing tenants. In fact, as the vacancy rate rises, so does the rent payment per month of our existing tenants. However, the fact remains: as the vacancy rate rises, so does the rent paid by our existing tenants.

The New York City real estate market is one of the most unique in the world. Real estate agents often use a "golden ratio" to gauge the real estate market. The golden ratio measures the difference between the current price and the approximate average cost of comparable properties. In other words, a house of equal size and quality should be priced about 3 times more expensive than a comparable property. In Manhattan, the golden ratio is currently around 2x. This means that the median price of a home in Manhattan is about $1.1 million, but the median rent for a one bedroom apartment is about $2,400. This disparity is in part due to the increasing number of new units being added to the market.

The occupancy rate of NYC apartment buildings has been steadily increasing over the last decade. In 2007, the ratio was around 66% with a total of 993,000 units. In 2016, the occupancy rate was 83% with a total of 1,874,000 units. This is in line with the decreasing number of vacant buildings and the rising number of renter occupied units.

However, the construction boom driven by new construction moving into the market has been a catalyst for the increase in vacancies. From 2006 to 2015, the construction market saw a steady increase in the number of units coming to market, as well as the total number of units brought to market. By 2015, it was found that the number of units coming to market decreased by 1.7%. The result: an increase in the number of vacant buildings and an increase in renter occupied units.

The New York City Building Boom

As the vacancy rate continues to rise, building owners will likely continue to seek ways to increase their revenues. By increasing the number of units they bring into the market, they can keep existing tenants happy, while flipping more units at a profit. New for 2016, building owners will be allowed to lease up to 4 units per building. This allows them to offer longer leases (and therefore, higher rents) to their tenants.

This is not the only change coming to the rental market in 2016. One of the most significant changes in the near term is the introduction of rent control. The Rent Stabilization Act of 1999 allowed building owners to reduce rents for a limited time. In 2016, this will change, with new rent control laws being introduced. Rent control will have a limited and fixed duration, and will only be available to buildings that are at least 20 years old.

A recent study by Riley Properties found that Manhattan's rental vacancy rate has been rising steadily since the end of 2013. The study's authors found that the vacancy rate increased from 0.96% in 2013 to 1.84% in 2016. This increase in vacancy is in accordance with a rising supply of apartments on the market.

In addition, v alue fell from 3.19% in 2013 to 2.93% in 2016, leading Riley to conclude that "increases in new building supply have led to increases in vacancy." A 2016 study by Zillow found that the average Manhattan rental price increased by about 10% between 2013 and 2015, reaching $4,400 in 2015.<|endoftext|>Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, said in a telephone interview that he does not want to pressure the members of Congress to raise the debt limit.

"I don't think there's any leverage for me," he said in an interview with The Washington Post. "If they want to give me credit for something, I guess that's fine."

Echoing comments he made during a campaign rally in Iowa last month, Trump said that raising the debt limit is an option that he would consider but is not a top priority.

"I'm not a big fan of debt ceiling increases," he said. "I think it diminishes the United States a little bit. I don't like it."

When asked if he would support a debt ceiling increase that raised spending caps or other reforms, Trump responded: "I would look at it. I'm not looking to do credit to myself. I don't like that."

But when pressed on what he would do, Trump indicated he would not force a government shutdown to force a debt-ceiling increase. "You can't use that as an excuse," he said.

The interview took place after Trump held an event in Iowa with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who has been threatening his Republican rivals with a protracted fight over limiting spending to try and win the nomination. Trump initially refused to endorse Cruz, but the two men have since teamed up to try to stop Trump from winning the nomination.

The White House is also bracing for a lengthy budget fight during the lame-duck session of Congress, which ends at the end of the year.

On Thursday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), one of the Republicans in the Senate who have called for a clean government funding bill to avoid a shutdown, said in an interview that the deficit is "out of control" and that there is a risk of default.

"I'm not going to wait for the crisis to happen," McCain said. "I'm not going to let it happen. And I don't think the country's going to let it happen."

He said he was not sure how long a shutdown could last, saying: "I'm not a math guy, but I just don't see how long it can possibly last."

Tony Fratto, a former deputy press secretary to President George W. Bush, said in an interview that although he is "not a fan of the government shutdown," he is not sure Trump would be prepared to risk a government shutdown over a debt-limit hike.

"It's a problem for him and for the Republicans," Fratto said. "He's going to have to figure out how to handle it if he wants

% respectively . However, with this rise in rents, the vacancy rate has also climbed consistently over the same period. From its 20 11 low (of 0.96%) it has almost doubled (to 1.84%) as of the end of 2016. The fact is our local economy has not created high-paying jobs at a level that can fill these pricey Manhattan apartments.

Adding V alue

Coinciding with the climbing vacancy rate, was a rise in landlord concessions. Climbing steadily since 2013, by year-end 2016, they were found in 22% of new leases signed with our firm. At their peak in 2009, incentives were found in a full 52% of leases, but by 2013, only 7% included one. While their efficacy can be debated, building owners would much rather pay brokerage fees or offer a month - or more - of free rent to new tenants than lower their asking rent. These short-term inducements help building owners achieve long-term goals.

Building Boom

In addition, apartment seekers had more and more rental product to choose from as the ten-year period progressed. In 2007 , 2,355 newly-constructed rental units were brought to market in Manhattan below 96th Street. In comparison,
==================== COMPLETION 196 ====================
 by the end of 2016, the number of new units under construction had grown by 619 to 3,880, an increase of 2,986 units. One of the most dramatic increases was with the construction of new projects in Lower Manhattan. Between 2007 and 2016, the average number of units under construction in Lower Manhattan rose by 23.8%, indicating an increase of 230 units per year.

Capping The Boom

But while the building boom was here, it was not too long before we hit a ceiling. In 2007, 23% of the units under construction in Manhattan were below 96th Street. By 2016, it was only 7%. Since 2007, up to a cumulative total of 51,710 units have been completed in Manhattan, and only 11% of these below 96th Street. In comparison, the average number of units under construction in Lower Manhattan in 2017 was 4,606, an increase of 4,726 units over the past five years.

And so the question remained: can New York City continue to sustain its rejuvenated economy?

It's a Question We Succinctly Asked

Our answer to that question was no. While we still do not have a completely clear answer, the key question we posed is this: if the building boom continues to continue, what will the city look like in another five years?

Our answer to that question was "not very desirable" by a margin of 20%. In other words, if the boom continues, we believe the city's quality of life will decline.

The Upshot

The building boom is indeed the defining characteristic of New York City right now. And it's not a temporary phenomenon. It's not going to go away. In fact, we think we're witnessing the beginning of the end of this particular building boom.

It's not going to last forever. It's going to end. It's going to end. It's going to end. It's going to end. It's going to end.

It will continue to be the case that the building boom is the defining characteristic of New York City. It will be part of the nature of our city for decades to come. But it will not last forever. And as the building boom ends, so does our city.

What can we do to ensure that we don't see our city's quality of life decline?

One thing we can do is to look at the housing stock that New York City has available to us and ask ourselves: if we were to build that housing, what would it cost? What would it cost to build in the current economic environment?

New York City has far more housing stock than we can ever hope to build. But we have an opportunity to build more housing than we do today if we can make the case that it's the right thing to do.

We can do better.<|endoftext|>The abandoned and crumbling town of Millwood, Virginia, is experiencing a renaissance in the form of a new convenience store and a new website.

Millwood Town Center, which sits on a desolate stretch of Route 28 just off Interstate 64, was recently purchased by an investment group. The new owners plan to redevelop the site, which is currently home to a K-Mart and several gas stations, into a shopping center with two new grocery stores.

The convenience store, called Millwood Grocery, was listed for sale on Craigslist for $2.5 million. But the store's owner, Mohammad Zaki, told WTVR that the asking price is actually $2.8 million.

Zaki said that the price is "only" because the store is still being remodeled, and "the new owner would like to have a bigger store."

, of calamities, of foreign invasions, and of calamities of our own making. I am told, that the origin of the Arian heresy is to be traced to the society of the Peripatetics; that the doctrine of the soul, and of the person, were absurdities; that the world and the body were incorporeal, and that the soul's immortality was a fiction. I know that the dogmas of the Peripatetics were not necessarily connected with the doctrines of the Stoics and Epicureans; that they were, in their turn, the effect and the consequence of the new system of the Pythagoreans; that these two systems had its origin in the old philosophy of the schools; that the elements of philosophy had always been alive in the forgotten explanation of the Pythagoreans; that those elements had had their return and their reproduction in the new system; that the doctrine of the soul and of the person was a theory of the Pythagorean philosophy, or that the doctrine of the soul and of the person was a doctrine of the new philosophy. I know also, that the doctrine of the soul and of the person was put forward as the immediate or natural consequence of the doctrines of the Peripatetics, the consequence of the doctrine of the elements, the consequence of the doctrine of the four humours, and the consequence of the doctrine of the four elements; that the Peripatetic philosophy was a theory of the elements, a theory of the four humours, a theory of the four elements, and a theory of the elements and the four humours; that the doctrine of the soul and of the person was a doctrine of the elements, a doctrine of the four humours, a doctrine of the four elements, and a doctrine of the elements and the four humours; that the doctrine of the soul and of the person was a theory of the elements, a theory of the four humours, a doctrine of the four elements, and a theory of the elements and the four humours; that the doctrine of the soul and of the person was a doctrine of the elements, a theory of the four humours, a theory of the four elements, and a theory of the four elements and the four humours; that the doctrine of the soul and of the person was a doctrine of the elements, a theory of the four humours, a theory of the four elements, and a theory of the elements and the four humours. I know also that the doctrine of the soul and of the person was the last and most important of the doctrines of the Peripatetics, and that the doctrine of the soul and of the person was the last and most essential doctrine of the Peripatetics. My knowledge of the general history of the Peripatetics, their general principles and their general doctrines, is limited, and I shall not be able to trace their history, either from the times of their founding, or from the times of their decline and fall. The doctrine of the soul and of the person, the doctrine of the elements, the doctrine of the four humours, the doctrine of the four elements, and the doctrine of the four elements and the four humours, is the last and most essential doctrine of the Peripatetics. The doctrine of the soul and of the person, the doctrine of the elements, the doctrine of the four humours, the doctrine of the four elements, and the doctrine of the four elements and the four humours, is the first and most essential doctrine of the Peripatetics.

 and misfortunes; the first, in the vital condition of the empire; the second, in the weakness of the capital, which the Romans had adopted as their city of refuge and refuge in the East and the West. The historian, however, who would pursue my system with the same diligence and industry, would exhibit to the readers of his work, not only the vicissitudes of the Roman empire, but the vicissitudes of the frontier republics, and the vicissitudes of every other country of the West; and would succeed in furnishing a more striking and more instructive contrast to the successive events of the Eastern empire, than he could have done, if he had inserted in this work the narrative of the Republic, of the Carthaginian empire, or of the Roman empire, the last of which, under the same name of the Roman world, he would have entirely abandoned to the oblivion of the ages. It is scarcely possible, that the reader, who should prefer the history of the empire to the history of the republics or the provinces, or Edition: current; Page: [216] the history of the city to the history of the country, could wish to hear the story of the Romans maintained in their vigour and independence; and that, on the contrary, the reader, who would prefer the history of the republics to that of the country, could not but be astonished, and would be more disposed to regret, that such a history should be so frequently interrupted by the revolutions of the republics. The political and geographical history of the Roman empire has thus been performed, in the manner above described, in a very imperfect state. The successive epochs of the Roman empire are, with an obvious propriety, divided into two periods, of which the first is the period of the emperors of the fourth century, the second the period of the emperors of the first and second centuries. In the first period of the emperors of the fourth century, the empire was strongly guarded by the Goths and the Saracens; and it was not till the third year of the reign of Honorius, the son of Hadrian, that the Eastern barbarians were vanquished and subdued. The Turkish princes, who extended their conquests from the confines of the Roman empire, had been very far advanced in their development and perfection of art and science. They had been long accustomed to the art of war; and they acquired this art at a very early period of their history. This arts and sciences were, with some little modifications, carried into Europe; and the arts of the East, especially of the sciences, were cultivated by the Germans and the Greeks, who had received their education from the East. In the second period of the emperors of the first and second centuries, the empire was weakened and divided by the internal Edition: current; Page: [217] discord of the Gauls; the Roman power was, with some degree of success, restored to the provinces, and the Goths were driven from the Rhine and the Danube. The barbarians had been long accustomed to the habits of peace and tranquillity; and the Romans had been long accustomed to their wars and intrigues. The Roman empire, however, was not exposed to the same dangers as that of the Gauls, and its internal tranquillity was not disturbed by the disorders of the barbarians. This state of things may be compared with the state of the provinces in the time of the first and second emperors. The Gauls, who had been long accustomed to war, and the Romans, who had been long accustomed to peace and tranquillity, were now at length expelled from the country. The Goths, who had wished to invade the Roman empire, had been driven from the Rh

, calamity, and misery. They must still unfold the pernicious regulations of the Turkish government, and the mischievous policy of the court of Rome. The throne of Constantinople is the scene of the most striking and memorable events of the history of the East. It was its first seat; it was its last conquest; it was its capital at the time of the conquest, and at the period of the fall. I shall apply myself to those events, and to the character of the people, who were so fortunate as to preside over the empire during the most brilliant and prosperous period of its existence. I shall inquire what they were in the prime of existence; what they were in the prime of decay; what they were in the prime of decay in the decline of the empire; what they were in the prime of decay in the decline of the empire in the time of its fall; what they were in the prime of decay in the fall of the empire; what they were in the prime of decay in the fall of the empire in the time of the fall of the last Turkish emperor. I shall examine, in the first place, the character and fortune of the emperors, who, from the first to the last, had a share in the government of the empire. I shall observe the general trends of the reigns, the progress of the empire, the development, or rather the receding of the state of the empire. I shall trace the progress of the reformation, the progress of the civil wars, the progress of the barbarians, the progress of the arts, the progress of the science, and the progress of the fanaticism, of the emperors.

Five centuries of the decline and fall of the empire have already elapsed; but a period of more than eight hundred years still separates me from the term of my labours, the taking of Constantinople by the Turks. Should I persevere in the same course, should I observe the same measure, a prolix and slender thread would be spun through many a volume, nor would the patient reader find an adequate reward of instruction or amusement. At every step, as we sink deeper in the decline and fall of the Eastern empire, the annals of each succeeding reign would impose a more ungrateful and melancholy task. These annals must continue to repeat a tedious and uniform tale of weakness

 and decay, of ruin and desolation, of eternal desolation, of great and glorious successes, of great and terrible disasters. Their constant aim and purpose is to render the mind drowsy, and to render the imagination passive and inactive. A master of history will not be deceived by the declamation of the historian; he will perceive that, as he has extracted the observations, or rather, the whole history of each era, from the most attractive source, so he has been led to an evident and undeniable conclusion, Edition: current; Page: [216] that the history of the last two centuries has been the most miserable of all ages. As it has been the most lamented, we may easily understand that it has been the most poetical and most spirited. The life of man, and the virtues of his conduct, have been sacrificed in the most forcible manner, to the passions of the age. The powerful monarchs have been the first victims of the civil war; but the families of the emperors, and the minds of the people, have been the next; and the most distinguished and virtuous of the whole race of emperors have been the last, and the most unworthy of the glory and merit they so ungratefully obtained. The last of the Roman emperors, the most worthy of that name, and the last, I say, of all the emperors, had not the temerity to assert his right to the empire, or to take a public part in the war with the Barbarian. The zeal of his family, and the despotism of his adherents, had exalted him to the throne, and the impunity of his usurpation had silenced the voice of reason and justice. The time for a contest was now come; the arms of the Latins were extended; and with the arms of the princes of the house of Græci, the dominion of the Roman empire was extinguished. The artful historians, who have endeavored to elevate the titles, the fame, and the character of the first, and even of the most eminent princes of the house of Græci, have uniformly fallen into the common error of attributing to these emperors, to a greater degree than they were possessed with, the right of ruling the empire. Their authors have laid their hands on the crown, and adorned the throne with silver and gold; they have usurped the sceptre, and have adorned the purple with the sceptre of tyranny. The usurpation of the Latins at Constantinople was not a new transaction; the senate and people of that city, before the conquest of the empire, had been the most obedient subjects of the Latin sovereignty. Their obedience was so long and so universally acquiesced in, that the Latins considered it as a matter of indifference, whether they were themselves the owners of the throne or not. Such was the steady obedience of the Latins, that they could not be persuad by the most eloquent arguments, that they ought to be masters of the empire, or that the English were the rightful owners of it. The Latins, in a short time, were in the full possession of the capital of the empire, their own foundations were laid, and their walls were erected. The Latins, by their own acts, had usurped the throne, and the Greek emperors, by their own acts, had usurped the power. The Roman empire was destroyed, and the Roman people were exterminated. The Greeks were once more masters of the whole world. But they had now in their possession, not the empire, but the ruins of it. It was impossible for the Greeks, who had been long in possession of the whole world, to restore it to the Roman people. The only way they could restore it, was by another conquest, and

Leonard Rosen, the marketing dynamo from Baltimore who invented Cape Coral, was a visionary and a rogue. He and his brother Jack got rich selling an anti-baldness tonic made from lanolin, a wool grease secreted by sheep; they promoted it with some of America's first infomercials, featuring the immortal tagline: "Have you ever seen a bald sheep?" Leonard's daughter, Linda Sterling, remembers him as a self-educated genius and warmhearted philanthropist, but also a relentless snake-oil salesman and incorrigible rulebreaker. He drove the wrong way on one-way streets. He wore tennis clothes to meetings with his Wall Street bankers. He sang "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown" around the house: … Baddest man in the whole damn town …

"He loved being the bad boy," Sterling told me. "He was impervious to rules."

The Rosen brothers realized they could sell Florida as another miracle elixir, "a rich man's paradise, within the financial reach of everyone." They started with some rugged mangrove swamp and palmetto scrub known as Redfish Point, which they rebranded as Cape Coral. Their dredges and draglines dug drainage ditches through

 the mangroves, and their bulldozers broke through the thick undergrowth along the banks of the bay to cut down swaths of mangrove. The Rosen's leased the land to the city and built a "town center" around the dredged-up bay. The city sold the land to wealthy investors, who built mansions and villas on the reclaimed land. The Rosen brothers also acquired a large tract of land to the north, which they renamed Alligator Point.

The Rosen brothers also acquired a large tract of land to the north, which they renamed Alligator Point. The Rosen brothers, who had already begun to make money, had to make more. They bought an old oyster farm in Alligator Point, built a dredge, and began to dredge an even larger tract of land. They dredged a channel from Alligator Point to Cape Canaveral, and they built a massive new coast guard station there. They dredged the bay, and they built new roads and a jetty. They built a commercial fishing pier and a hotel. They built a dolphinarium and a sailing club, and they built a boatbuilding school. They built a golf course. They spent $500,000 to build a waterfront boathouse, and they built a football field, a baseball field, and a soccer field. They had no idea what they'd have for their new city, but they hoped it would be an economic haven, a place where people could come to escape the high cost of living in Miami. They called it Cape Canaveral.

"It was a vision of a better way to do business," says a former Bay employee who worked at the time. "They were the first to see how big the bay could be."

The Rosen brothers' visionary plan for Cape Canaveral was to carve out a corridor of space-age infrastructure that would allow them to exploit a unique advantage: the Atlantic Ocean. The Rosen brothers were essentially building a second city off the coast of Miami. They envisioned Cape Canaveral as a gateway to the Atlantic, a place where people could escape the high cost of living in Miami. They called it Cape Canaveral.

 the swamps, saving some of the swampland for cattle ranching. The riggers were swamped with sand up to their necks. But the land was rich in coral and mangroves, and they soon had a thriving resort town of 2,000 people.

The Rosen brothers had a secret weapon: a longtime army of beachfront workers, many of them ex-convicts. The Rosen brothers were Southern Baptists, and their beachfront community was a stronghold for the denomination. But unlike the upper-crust New Apostolic Church, which was organized as a private club, the Rosen front group was an official church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the religion of millions. When the Rosen brothers turned Cape Coral into a holiday resort, they recruited ex-convicts for their landscaping crew. In return, they provided them with cash wages and free housing. Today, many of the workers are still on the Rosen payroll, and their children grow up in Cape Coral.

And then there's the Palm Beach crime lord.

On a bright day in July, I dropped by the town of Lake Worth, where I was staying. I had been sent to Lake Worth to investigate the murder of a young woman named Kelly Haines. The police had arrested the man they believed was the killer. He had been living under a fake name in Lake Worth, moping around a motel, wearing a wire, and had revealed that he had killed Haines and planned to kill more victims. He told police he did it because he hated cops. He said he was a drug dealer, but of course.

I made the rounds of local law enforcement agencies, questioning people on the record about the case. I interviewed the police, the prosecutors, the judge, the defense attorney—all of them agreed that a murder would have been impossible without a murder weapon. I spoke to a local preacher. I spoke to a local news anchor. I talked to one of the men who had shot Haines, and he said he was a crackhead, but he didn't know who was killing others. I talked to a family member of the victim, who said she was convinced that the man in the video was her son. I talked to a lifelong resident of Lake Worth. She said she barely recognized her town—it had changed so much. She said she had never seen so much destruction. When I asked her who killed her son, she looked at me like I had asked her who killed JFK.

"Who did it?" I replied.

"I don't know."

"It's my son," she said.

"Are you sure?"

"No."

"I'm just asking. You have to be sure."

"I don't know who did it."

"Who's the man?"

"I don't know."

"I want to know."

"I'm not sure."

"It's my son."

"It's too early to tell."

I left Lake Worth and made my way to Palm Beach County. I spent the next few days driving down the famous roadway, passing through small towns you've never heard of but are home to many of the cliqueiest residents in America. I pulled into a motel room in Xochimilco, an impoverished town of about 12,000. The room was small and dark, with a low ceiling and a chipped, cracked plaster floor. I twisted my way to the window, which was covered with a sheet. I could see a split-level room, with a bed, a chair, a TV, and a chair in the corner. I could see a motel key on

Leonard Rosen, the marketing dynamo from Baltimore who invented Cape Coral, was a visionary and a rogue. He and his brother Jack got rich selling an anti-baldness tonic made from lanolin, a wool grease secreted by sheep; they promoted it with some of America's first infomercials, featuring the immortal tagline: "Have you ever seen a bald sheep?" Leonard's daughter, Linda Sterling, remembers him as a self-educated genius and warmhearted philanthropist, but also a relentless snake-oil salesman and incorrigible rulebreaker. He drove the wrong way on one-way streets. He wore tennis clothes to meetings with his Wall Street bankers. He sang "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown" around the house: … Baddest man in the whole damn town …

"He loved being the bad boy," Sterling told me. "He was impervious to rules."

The Rosen brothers realized they could sell Florida as another miracle elixir, "a rich man's paradise, within the financial reach of everyone." They started with some rugged mangrove swamp and palmetto scrub known as Redfish Point, which they rebranded as Cape Coral. Their dredges and draglines dug drainage ditches through

 rocky reefs and marshland, and the islands were built on top of them. The island was a tourist magnet, and in the years before the Depression, Cape Coral became a self-sustaining community.

"We can be as cruel as we want to be," Rosen told a reporter for The New York Times in 1931, "and the people will still appreciate it."

But the economic downturn of the 1930s and the Depression accelerated Cape Coral's decline. In 1937, Rosen was arrested on allegations of fraud — he had inflated construction costs on a beachfront apartment complex. He was convicted, convicted again, convicted again, convicted again. Over the next decade, he was ordered to pay $3 million in fines and restitution, and he finally died in prison in 1950.

The Rosen brothers' story is a classic illustration of the way greed, hubris, and a blind faith in free markets can result in the destruction of small communities. But it's also a cautionary tale about how these same forces, which threaten to destroy our own country, can swiftly crush small towns — even in the best of times.

"Cape Coral is not a city like New York or Chicago," said Don Harkins, who grew up on the island and now runs the Cape Coral Historical Society. "There's no shopping. There's no shopping. There's no real entertainment. There's no real entertainment. You can't do anything. There's no place to go. And we've got to keep it that way."

As Harkins and I drove along the beach, a tropical wind whipped up tiny clouds of sand and sandflies. We were passing some of the few structures left on Cape Coral — the three-story former blacksmith shop, the church, and the dock where the town's ferries pick up passengers.

It's a foregone conclusion that Cape Coral will soon be removed from the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The town's destruction is a direct result of a spirit of free markets, but it's also a result of a spirit of greed, misplaced priorities, and the failure of our political leaders to take on the hard realities of how our economy works.

Cape Coral's demise is not because of the value of the islands' natural resources — they're worth at least $1 million. It's because the Rosen brothers, and the corporations they founded, got carried away with their own visions of what they thought the future of the American economy should look like. And that vision was centered on a two-fer: They believed that government should have no role in protecting us from the market forces that caused their community to fail.

"They were wrong," said Harkins. "The government ought to be a powerful protector."

They were wrong about everything.

A brief history of the American economy

Market forces have been destroying places like Cape Coral for decades.

The first generation of post-World War II Americans had a very different view of America's economy than the generations that came after them. They believed that the nation's economic destiny was tied up with the country's role as the global leader in technology and creativity. They believed that the country's economic strength would be assured by the nation's military might, and they believed that the country was best protected from the forces of international trade by maintaining a strong dollar.

The so-called New Deal was the first attempt to impose economic discipline on the American economy — a system that focused on government spending, regulation, and the nationalization of vital industries, like the steel industry. It was a slow path to recovery.

After the crisis of the 1930s, many Americans looked to government to save them from the ghost of the

 the forest, and the company leased a highway right through the heart of the city.

That's how Leonard and Jack Rosen made their first million. In the mid-1980s, they pulled in a bit more money, thanks to a short-lived venture to build a casino in Cape Coral, which was ultimately abandoned. But in the late 1980s, the Rosen brothers started selling Cape Coral, and the company grew. By 1991, it was the country's fifth-largest maker of light bulbs, and its sales were rising. By the early 2000s, Cape Coral had become a global powerhouse. Its sales had risen to $1.8 billion, and it was valued at $2.5 billion.

Cape Coral's growth was stunning at first, and it attracted a lot of attention. Leonard and Jack Rosen attended, along with a few of their relatives, the 2000 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. They were invited to a party hosted by a Swiss bank, which rolled out a table full of petrochemicals and "commodity forest" products. It was the beginning of what would be an astonishing career of questionable ethics and questionable business practices.

In the early 2000s, the Rosen brothers were making a lot of money. They had acquired a few oil leases in the Everglades, and they were making money selling palm oil, a hot commodity in the developing world. In the process, they were doing the bidding of a few powerful men in the region:

• In the early 2000s, the Rosen brothers bought more than 1,000 acres of land in the Everglades in a partnership with the government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. They sold the land to the government at a nominal price and pocketed the profits.

• In 2002, the company hired a former senior U.S. Army officer, who had led the U.S. military's effort to clear land and mine oil in the region, to work for the company as a consultant on how to develop new palm oil plantations.

• In 2003, the company purchased a $1.6 million, three-bedroom mansion in Cape Coral, which was listed for sale by Leonard Rosen on the company's website. The listing boasted of the mansion's location, proximity to the beach, and proximity to "instantaneous access to the world's only large-scale, continuous, large-scale, and fully automated land-based OTC (on-trade) palm oil plantation." The listing also said that the house was "exactly as pictured and described."

Leonard Rosen's self-described "boomtown" is laid out on a map of Cape Coral.

The house was built by a company called US Properties Group, which was founded by Leonard Rosen's brother, Jack.

US Properties Group is an offshore investment company, registered in the British Virgin Islands with an address in the British Virgin Islands. The company was founded in the late 1980s by Leonard Rosen's brother, Jack. Jack Rosen has not been accused of any wrongdoing, and he has said the company was set up to manage the family's investments in the Caribbean.

US Properties Group has had other contracts with the government of the Marshall Islands — including with the government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, where the company has also done business.

The company is registered in the British Virgin Islands, but it also has offices in the Netherlands and Ireland. The company's website describes its business as "international investment management services."

"We are an independent, offshore investment management company operating in the mature, high-growth markets of the Asia Pacific, North America, South America and Europe," the website states.

The FBI's role in the investigation has been critical in securing the arrest of the alleged perpetrator, and we are grateful for their work in this regard. We are also pleased that the potential impact on our JCCs has been minimized," Krakow said.The JCCs are the single largest source of funding for Israeli settlement activities in the occupied West Bank, and many of the groups have been targets of hateful harassment, including bomb threats, of late.In the past two years, JCCs in the U.S. have received roughly 100 bomb threats.In 2015, a school in Washington D.C. evacuated after receiving a threat of a "gun and bomb" on its campus.Last month, a Jewish school in Los Angeles was evacuated after a bomb threat was made to the building.The threats have increased in frequency since the beginning of the year, with some JCCs receiving dozens of threats within a matter of days.JCCs have also received numerous threats of violence. In January, for instance, a Jewish school in St. Louis received a bomb threat and was forced to close for a day.After the threatening phone call, the school's principal said he was assured by the FBI that the threat was not credible.The FBI's New York office has also tracked several incidents of "anti-Semitism" on social media.The ADL has identified various trends among the perpetrators of these threats in recent years.In one case, the ADL found that the most common perpetrator was a male in his mid-20s who made the bomb threat to the JCC in Bloomington, Indiana, in February.In another case, the ADL found that the most common perpetrator was a male in his late 20s or early 30s who made the bomb threat to a JCC in New Jersey in February.In one case, the ADL found that the third most common perpetrator was a male in his late 20s or early 30s who made the bomb threat to the JCC in New York in March.The ADL has also identified patterns of anti-Semitic posts and comments on social media.In one case, the ADL found that the most common perpetrator was a male in his mid-20s who made a post on Facebook in January that read, in part, "Looks like the Jew Boycotter has finally gotten the joke."The ADL also found that the most common perpetrator of anti-Semitic comments on social media was a male in his mid-20s who made a post on Facebook in February that said, "So, let's get this straight. There is a war on for the future of Israel. It's being led by those damn Jews who won't put the safety of their people first."The ADL has recorded a significant increase in hate crimes targeting Jewish communities in the U.S. over the last few years, which it attributes in part to the election of Donald Trump and his equivocal statements about Israel. The ADL has also found a significant increase in online harassment targeting Jewish institutions since the start of the year.The administration's decision to move forward with the initial charges comes as Attorney General Jeff Sessions is under fire for this past week's visit to a Jewish group that was criticized for promoting his agenda, and for his past statements on the Klan.On Wednesday, Sessions made a speech to the Anti-Defamation League in which he criticized a speech given by the group's president, Jonathan Greenblatt, on Tuesday in which he encouraged members to "fight back" against the "attacks on our people," which were "anti-Semitic and xenophobic."Greenblatt was widely criticized for the speech, which was interspersed with anti-Israel and pro-Palestine comments.

The play was a tribute to the late, great actor, Ronald Reagan. Before the game, the Rams' owner, Stan Kroenke, said the play would be a tribute to Reagan, who was a Rams fan.

"I think it's a great tribute to Ronald Reagan," Kroenke said after the game. "We had a couple of plays we wanted to make sure we got to the end of the game, and that was one of them. I think it's a great tribute to him. I think it's a great tribute to Ronald Reagan."

It wasn't the only tribute the Rams paid to Reagan. The Rams even had a tribute video during their pregame show after the game.

Kroenke said he was "really honored" to be able to pay tribute to Reagan, and he had no problem with the gesture being made by his team.

"I think it's really a great thing," he said. "We're a big Ronald Reagan fan, but we're not a big Ronald Reagan guy. We're a football team. We do things on the field that are pretty cool. I'm glad they've gotten the message across."<|endoftext|>2017/03/04 15:55

WASHINGTON, March 4 (Yonhap) -- The United States on Thursday warned North Korea against making any further provocations, as tensions mounted on the Korean Peninsula over its nuclear test.

"We see North Korea's provocative actions as an effort to isolate the current government in Pyongyang from the international community," State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.

"Any further provocative actions by North Korea will be met with a strong and united response."


The statement came as the U.S. on Thursday urged North Korea to refrain from making further provocations and be prepared to respond to any attacks.

"The United States is working closely with our South Korean and Japanese allies and partners to maintain pressure on North Korea," Kirby said. "We are also taking steps to respond to North Korea's latest provocations."


Kirby made the statement during a regular news briefing, the first official briefing by the U.S. State Department on the North's latest nuclear test.

The 44-year-old Kim Jong-un is pushing ahead with his country's development of nuclear weapons.

The United States and South Korea are planning to deploy a missile defense system called Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, in South Korea as early as next year.

Television footage showed the North's leader signing documents with a military aide in Pyongyang, a move that could be a sign of his support for the planned deployment.

The North's nuclear test Tuesday was its sixth in the past six months and its third since Kim Jong-un assumed power.

The study, which used 2010 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, found that the total cost to the US economy of Americans in poor health is $460 billion, or $1,000 per person, a number that has increased by about $30 billion since 2000.

SPONSORED

The health of Americans in poor health is also a factor in the nation's lack of productivity, the study found. In 2009, workers in the lowest income quintile had a productivity score of less than 10, which is lower than comparable workers in other countries.

"The fact that productivity has deteriorated for both low-income workers and those of higher income is quite striking, and it's something that should be very troubling for all Americans," said study co-author Robert Moffitt of the University of California, Berkeley.

The study also found that the cost of poor health negatively impacted the nation's overall economic growth, with the health of Americans in poor health contributing about 2 percent of the country's gross domestic product.

The study also found that the cost of poor health was responsible for more than 500,000 lost jobs across the US economy.

"One of the main messages in the paper is that the productivity of the economy is going down for the average American not just because of the aging of the population but also because of the poor health of the average American," Moffitt said.

The study was published in the American Journal of Public Health.

AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to a new piece by the New York Times reporter, Jayson Blair. His piece "After the Sandy Hook Massacre, the Gun Industry's Arctic Exodus" is headlined "Scores of the industry's leading players have moved their headquarters out of America, and many more are likely to follow."

JAYSON BLAIR: The gun industry's top executives and lobbyists have fled to Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries amid soaring legislative and regulatory proposals that could, if enacted, make it harder for them to sell their weapons. The American gun industry is increasingly fleeing the United States.

Across the country, some of the country's most prominent gun makers have relocated their headquarters or closed their doors, fearful of a new wave of restrictions in states that are considering new guns laws. They have left behind well-funded lobbying operations and huge financial reserves, leaving the gun industry with little chance of surviving a wave of new laws.

The gun industry is expected to lose between $3 and $6 billion this year, according to industry experts.

The industry has been the target of intense lobbying and barely a whisper from the White House. President Obama has made a point of ignoring the gun lobby and the gun violence that plagues urban and rural America.

This week, the White House hosted a conference of the nation's leading gun manufacturers and retailers. The summit was hosted by Mark Glaze, president of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the largest gun lobby group in Washington and a former adviser to Michael Bloomberg. Glaze has urged the president to take on the gun lobby and pass stronger gun laws. He told the president in the meeting he should not make the industry's job any harder with his inaction.

When should I use this instead of the mouse? Edit

The key to using the mouse is learning to use the interface. When you are learning a new interface, it is useful to use it as often as possible to get a feel for it. If you are learning a new interface from scratch, you should use this as your desktop interface. In fact, if you don't use the mouse in this interface, you are doing it wrong. However, there are some cases where the mouse is useful. For example, if you are building a new interface and you have a printout of your interface, you can zoom in and out by using the mouse as the scroll wheel.

When should I use this instead of the keyboard? Edit

The keys on the keyboard are very limited. For example, you cannot enter text from the keyboard, and you can't type in the menus. Because of this, the keyboard is a better choice if you can't remember the shortcuts.

There are a number of important features. The first is the word list. You can use the word list to look up words you have entered in a command. You can also use the word list to look up words in a list of words. The second important feature is the search. You can use the search to find a word or a word to the left of a word. The third is the search function. By pressing the up arrow, you can search through your word list by typing a search term. The fourth feature is the highlighting of the text.

Don't take photos of yourself in places where you'd expect to be photographed, like the mall or a public place.

If you're in a public place where you have to pass through a camera to get to your car, take the same precautions you would for any other camera.

Don't carry your wallet or purse with you when you go through a camera, because facial recognition software will know where you're going and where you're going to be.

So what are you waiting for? Get your driver's license renewed before it expires, and then put it on your phone or computer before you go through a camera.

The tweet, which was shared by Ron Holmes, a pastor from the church Holmes attends in California, was in response to the death of Philando Castile, who was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop for a broken taillight. Castile was traveling with his girlfriend and her four children at the time of the shooting.

The tweet, which was shared over 1,700 times in less than 24 hours, claimed that the Black Lives Matter movement's answer to Philando Castile's death was to "take away the guns."

The tweet has since been deleted, but it was screencapped by the Outsports.com website and published.

The church pastor's tweet immediately drew the ire of many who identified with his comments.

"After the police killed Philando Castile, a father of four, I thought of the families of Philando Castile and Walter Scott," Holmes wrote in the tweet. "I thought of the many African-American men who are killed by police every year. I thought of the fathers who are raised by single mothers and who can't afford to send their sons to college. I thought of my own children. I thought of the countless other families whose sons, daughters and nephews have been killed by police. I thought of those who don't have a voice or who don't have a platform to speak for themselves. I thought about the many BLM members who want to take away the guns. I thought about the many members of BLM who will never be heard because they are afraid of being called a racist. In my mind, I thought about all these people and I thought about Philando Castile and his family. I am very sorry that I took this path. I am also very sorry that I did not think of the thousands of other African-American men who are killed by police every year."

The tweet has since been deleted, but it was screencapped by the Outsports.com website and published.

"This is a technology that can be abused by government officials, but it's worse than that," said Deputy Director of the ACLU of Southern California, Jay Stanley. "It will become the standard way to identify people in every state, and it's already being used to track people."

Stanley believes that the database should be kept private instead of being used by law enforcement and the courts to track down criminals.

"Facial recognition is a real threat to your privacy," Stanley said. "It's also an invasive technology that can be used to identify people without their knowledge."

Although the age-specific incidence of serogroup C meningitis is declining, rates of serogroup B meningitis are rising. We present the case of a man with invasive meningococcal disease diagnosed before age 50 years, who developed meningitis associated with meningococcal serogroup C after a decade of antibiotic treatment. The clinical course was traumatic, with hematemesis, fever, and anorexia, and he was admitted to the ICU for a long period. The clinical course was also traumatic, with complications that included pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis requiring prolonged hospitalization. Serologic testing revealed serogroup C infection. The diagnosis was confirmed by serologic tests using the serogroup B antigen.

The clinical course of meningococcal disease is complex. It can be closely associated with the onset of signs and symptoms of other diseases, and it can be caused by a variety of pathogens. In this case, the patient had bacterial meningitis with bacterial serogroup C infection that was associated with meningitis caused by serogroup B.

The current serogroup C serogroup B seroprevalence in the United States is approximately 9.7% (1). The serogroup B serogroup has been associated with invasive disease in the United States and has been implicated in an increasing number of deaths in the

, it's this man, who has been at this business for more than thirty years. His name is Ray, and he's one of the men who make up Children's Fairyland, a company that specializes in using puppets to make children's stories come to life.

He tells me that he started working at Children's Fairyland when he was a teenager. Hirschfield tells me that he started working for Children's Fairyland as a teenager as well. Ray is a member of the organization's board of directors, and he tells me that he's been with the company for the past thirty years, giving the same message he's been giving to people all along: that puppets can be a fun, interactive way to interact with children.

It sounds like a convincing argument. In fact, it's one that has been made by puppeteers, theater-makers, and storytellers for decades. But puppets don't really have a place within the modern educational paradigm. Instead, the puppeteers who help make Children's Fairyland's shows are considered educators, not entertainers – and the rest of the world is baffled by the fact that a company that has been so successful at meeting the needs of children's parents has profited from puppets for nearly two-hundred years.

"They made it into a money-making machine," says Hirschfield. "And that's not how it's supposed to work. I can't believe that people are still doing it."

Ray, who works full time at Children's Fairyland, started his career as a puppeteer in the late 1960s. He migrated to New York City from a small town in New England, where his dad owned a daycare center and a toy store. He took his first job at age seven, when he came home to help with the store's weekend sales. By the time he was ten, Ray was working on his own show, and the following year he had his own show at the Walter Reade Theater.

"I never had any money to spend on me," he says. "I thought it'd just be fun for me to be in a show."

He never forgot how the experience of making a puppet – of making something that could be an interactive experience for children – had made him feel. In fact, he decided to make his own show after working on a puppet show one night that turned into a musical and was a hit. He was hooked.

"I was in love with puppetry as a child," he says. "I was just so inspired by it, and I just wanted to do it again."

Ray moved to New York City in the late 1970s, where he worked on the production of sets for shows. By the time he was forty, Ray had turned Child's Fairyland into a full-time enterprise, putting on shows for all ages of children in all of New York City's theaters. He founded Children's Fairyland, which came to be known as a "puppetry school," in 1981.

Ray says that he never intended to become an educator. When he was a kid, he was more interested in the physical act of puppetry than he was in the creative process. He wasn't interested in how the puppets were made; he was more interested in the process of making them.

"I remember when I was a kid, I wouldn't have wanted to be a teacher. I would have wanted to be an actor. I would have wanted to be a playwright. I wouldn't have wanted to be a teacher. I would have wanted to be in the theater. I would have wanted to play music," he says.

The hospital is located in the backyard of a four-story brick building at the end of a dirt road in the southwest corner of the city. It's not far from the home of the Hirschfields, who have lived here for nearly 40 years. And it's not far from the home of the Puppet Museum, which has been in operation since 1941.

The Puppet Museum's original home was in a warehouse with no windows, next to an abandoned church. When the Hirschfields bought the building in the early 1980s, they couldn't imagine that they would one day be hosting three separate art museums on the same property. But the couple's passion for puppetry and their belief that the stories they were telling were so powerful that they could be passed along to future generations convinced them that they would finally be able to make Puppetland a reality.

The two museums are also connected. Each is housed in a separate building, but they share the same enclosed courtyard. They both host live performances and puppet shows. And each has a separate entrance, a separate entranceway, and a single entrance to the grounds.

The two museums are not just connected by a common building. Together they encompass everything in the city of San Francisco that is puppets, from the puppets themselves to the puppets' puppeteers, to the puppets' owners, to the puppets' owners' puppeteers, to everything in between.

They are one.

Puppetland is as much a part of San Francisco now as it was back in the 1930s.

From the outside, it looks like an ordinary neighborhood with a modestly sized two-story brick building, a street, and a small park on the way to the nearest grocery store. Still, there is something special about the place, something that makes it feel like a part of the city. It's not that it feels like a part of the city, really, but that it seems to have been conceived in the same way that the city itself is conceived. It's the same kind of place that, in a way, the city is itself.

Inside, it's a bit more complicated.

It's not just that Puppetland is a place where puppets can be seen and played, it's that Puppetland is a place where puppets can be seen and played not just as entertainment but as educational tools.

It's not that Puppetland is a place where puppets can be seen and played, but that Puppetland is a place where puppets can be seen and played not just as entertainment but as educational tools.

"There's a lot of different ways to touch puppets," Hirschfield explains, "but there's one way that everyone can do it: play with puppets."

Puppetland is the city's oldest and most comprehensive puppetry education center.

The Puppets at Work

The puppets at Puppetland come from a wide range of backgrounds. The puppets come from all over the city, but they come primarily from the Bay Area. Most come from puppetry schools, and most come from schools that are part of the California Academy of Fine Arts, the San Francisco Ballet Company, or the San Francisco Symphony.

==================== COMPLETION 223 ====================
, it is Hirschfield. She has been a puppeteer for 20 years and has a special rapport with these actors. "We can fix anything. We figure out what's wrong with them and fix it," she says.

Hirschfield and her team of five – and there are five of them, all of them talented and experienced – are the show's primary fixers. The other members of Children's Fairyland's support team, who include a nurse and three therapists, are there to help the puppets when they need it most – when they are injured or when they need a break. Hirschfield's entire team works as a team and collaborates with one another – coming up with a creative solution to a puppet's problem. "When it comes to puppets," she says, "we're all in the room on the same wavelength."

The children who attend Children's Fairyland's shows are not the kind most often associated with puppets. They are as different from the children who visit Kewpie the Clown as the ponies who perform at the park's so-called 'magic' or the puppets themselves. Whereas the Kewpie the Clown puppets are easy to spot, the Children's Fairyland puppets are more subtle. They are more akin to a piece of literature than a plastic toy, and they tend to be a bit older. "We tend to have the kids from kindergarten up," says Hirschfield.

Children's Fairyland aims to introduce children to puppetry and provide them with an opportunity to interact with puppets for the first time. The park's designers – a group of puppeteers led by Hirschfield – are innovative in the way the park operates, and in how they have created a venue where puppetry is paramount. Children play puppets in the park for free, and the park's puppeteers, who receive no compensation for their time, are not necessarily the most talented. But they are the ones who show the most passion for puppetry and who have the most time on their hands.

Children's Fairyland is like a miniature version of the larger Children's Museum in Manhattan. But it is not a museum. "We want to show the kids that puppetry is not just for scary movies," says Hirschfield. "Puppetry can be for kids of all ages."

The park's Puppets at Work shows run on a weekly schedule from 1:30pm to 4:30pm, and the puppets come to life in the park's many spaces, including the puppet hospital, where puppets are patched up and treated for illnesses, wounds and injuries and given a restorative treatment.

The puppets are given elaborate make-up, hairpieces and prosthetics to make them appear more realistic and emotive, and the puppeteers then create believable and dynamic scenes by using the puppets' facial expressions, gestures and movements.

The puppets have been hand-painted and made to look as lifelike as possible, and the puppeteers are proud of the quality of their work.

"We try to create this illusion of life and movement," says Hirschfield, "so that the kids can walk around and feel like they are part of the story."

Children's Fairyland also offers puppet workshops and performances for children as young as six. Children can join the park's puppet showing on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays and watch puppets being made and repaired. Puppets are also available to watch on Saturdays and Sundays.

For children who want to learn more about puppetry, Children's Fairyland offers a variety of programs for the young and old. They can play on the puppets in the puppetry hospital

It's not the first time Hirschfield's hobby has caught the eye of the authorities. In 2003, she was arrested while working on a puppet show in "the pink block" of the park. The show featured a puppet of a girl talking to a doctor behind a curtain, and a man in a lab coat was standing behind it. He was also working on a puppet of a woman talking to a doctor behind a curtain. A few months later, she was charged with violating the city's licensing requirements for puppets.

The puppet show case hinged on a legal technicality. "When I was working in the park, I had my face covered so I couldn't be seen," Hirschfield says, explaining that she could not be charged under the city's human rights ordinance because, as a woman, she was not performing in a public place. Hirschfield was convicted of violating the ordinance and sentenced to pay $1,250 in court costs; the puppets were forbidden from entering the park. Hirschfield appealed, and the city's Division of Licensing agreed with her, arguing that the puppets were not actually performing in a public place and therefore not subject to the ordinance.

Hirschfield's appeal was rejected, and she was ordered to pay $1,250 in court costs.

She appealed again, and this time the city's Division of Licensing agreed with her. The puppets were also forbidden from entering the park. This time Hirschfield was sentenced to pay $3,500 in court costs.

Although she was not convicted of performing in a public place, Hirschfield still faced a $1,250 fine for each offense, which meant she was forced to pay $60,000 in fines and court costs.

"I had to pay for the puppets, too," she says. The puppets were dismantled and shipped to her family's home in Southern California.

In 2004, Hirschfield was asked to appear in court for a second time. She was convicted of violating the city's licensing requirements and was sentenced to pay $3,500 in court costs and fees.

The puppets were dismantled and shipped to her family's home in Southern California.

Hirschfield, who has a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Pittsburgh, says the puppets are a hobby she does with her young daughter. "I just think it's fun," she says.

Hirschfield's story is not unique.

"I've heard of people who have spent a lot of time and money on puppets," says David Taylor, a professor of political science at California State University, Fullerton.

"I've also heard that there are people who are really into it. I've heard of people who are really into it but who are not aware of the rules," he says.

The California State Legislature has taken up a bill that would prohibit the sale of puppets and other unique children's toys and accessories in California, which already has its own law in place prohibiting the sale of toys "that are obscene, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate for a minor." If passed, the bill would prohibit the illegal sale of "any live animal, live bird, live reptile, or live fish" and would also prohibit the sale of "any toy or other article that is designed to resemble a live animal, a live bird, a live reptile, or a live fish."

Proponents of the bill say puppets are not obscene, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate for children because they, like the media, are not "objectively" harmful to children, they are not obscene because they are not aimed at

 as gay. Up to that point, much about her California childhood was typical. The youngest of six children in a staunch Mormon family, she had gotten into some trouble with her parents, but until she identified herself as a lesbian, they allowed her to continue living at home.

Not after that. "They flipped out," she says now, six years and many tears later. "I mean, I expected them to flip out, but my dad couldn't look at me, and my mom couldn't even talk to me. I just felt I was such a huge disappointment. They cried a lot."

Then they kicked her out of the house with no money and no plan.

That was, as she explains in her new memoir Saving Alex, releasing tomorrow from HarperOne, when her real nightmare began.

Alex's parents stayed in contact through another family in the ward, and communicated that they were going to pick her up and take her to visit her grandparents in St. George, Utah, for a while until things calmed down. Fair enough, she thought. She went along with this and was surprised to find that when they arrived in St. George, they pulled up at another house entirely and her parents announced that this was where Alex was going
==================== COMPLETION 225 ====================
.

"I don't remember why I was surprised," she writes. "I just was. I'd never been away from my family so long. I had no idea where I was going."

"I didn't know where I was going to sleep," she says, "but I knew that I had no place to go."

In the new book, Alex says she was so fearful that she almost didn't make it back to her grandparents' house after her mother drove her to the main road, ending up at the side of the road.

"I was so scared," Alex says, "that if I didn't wake up soon, I was going to be dead by the time they got back. I was going to be in the street by myself, and I didn't know if I would make it."

A few days later, Alex's parents got back in touch, telling her to pack a bag and wait for them in St. George. She was so relieved to hear from them, but when they got there, she says, they couldn't find her.

"They called and asked if I was going to be okay," she says. "I thought that I was going to be fine, but I was afraid. I didn't know where I was. I didn't know what was going on. I was just trying to get into my clothes and get ready to leave."

She describes sobbing as they searched for her, and when they finally found her, they had no news.

"I just felt like I was in this endless nightmare," she says. "I felt like I was in a living nightmare. I didn't know if I was dead or alive."

They took her to the hospital, where doctors discovered that she had cancer. Her parents were told she had cancer, but Alex says she didn't believe them, in part because she just had a bad case of strep throat during her time in school.

"I didn't know what cancer was," she says. "I didn't know about chemotherapy. I just thought that I had a bad case of strep throat. I didn't know anything about cancer."

She underwent surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, and her mother drove her to an in-patient program in Salt Lake City.

"I didn't really believe it at first," she says. "I was scared. I was just trying to be strong and stay strong."

Eventually, she went through with the treatment, and within two months, she was cancer-free.

"It was a miracle," Alex says. "I was so grateful for that."

And so, her book tells the story of how she survived cancer, how she started dating her current partner, and how, with the help of her parents' support, she lived her life as a lesbian.

"I've been so blessed, and they've been so supportive and loving," she says.

Alex's parents are divorced. She writes that her mother, who is now in her 60s, still struggles with her sexuality.

"I stopped looking at her in the same way," Alex says. "I'm not like I was when I was a child. I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin. I'm happy. I have a lot of friends. I feel like I'm really living."<|endoftext|>Publication date 1987

Not after that. "They flipped out," she says now, six years and many tears later. "I mean, I expected them to flip out, but my dad couldn't look at me, and my mom couldn't even talk to me. I just felt I was such a huge disappointment. They cried a lot."

That was, as she explains in her new memoir Saving Alex, releasing tomorrow from HarperOne, when her real nightmare began.

Alex's parents stayed in contact through another family in the ward, and communicated that they were going to pick her up and take her to visit her grandparents in St. George, Utah, for a while until things calmed down.

 to live.

This was weird. Alex hadn't really known her grandparents in St. George, let alone any of the other relatives who were all over the place.

"Why are you doing this?" she asked her parents. "You didn't ask me."

"Why not?" her dad demanded. "You're not going to move in."

"No, I am not," she said. "I don't want to move in with you."

Her parents were stunned. "I am very upset with you," her dad told her. "We have a plan for you."

Alex sighed and said, "Fine. I'll go with you."

She couldn't believe it. This was her family. This was what her parents wanted. But, again, there was no plan. Her parents didn't even have a name for the person she would be living with.

"Alex. I'm sorry," her dad said. "I know it's hard for you."

"You don't know me."

"I think you do."

Alex didn't like what she saw. She began to feel like a prisoner in her own home, held hostage. Her parents were angry with her for not meeting the expectations they had for her and that they themselves had set for her. They were angry with her for not just being what they wanted her to be.

"I want to be like them," she thought. "I want to be a Mormon and a good, obedient child." Of course, her parents didn't know what it was like to be their daughter, so they could never really know.

But they knew what it was like to be a gay kid in the church. They had been their own parents, so they understood. And they also knew what it was like to be the church's governing bodies. They understood what was required of them.

So Alex's parents did the only thing they could do: They told her to pack her bags and leave.

She packed, and all the while, she thought about her parents. They were always there to support her, but when she needed them the most, they were nowhere to be found. She had grown up in a strong family, but she was still a kid. She wanted to be able to look up to them like they did to her. So she packed a bag and hoped that she could find peace in one of the cities she had always wanted to visit.

She had to get out, and she had to find a way to get out.

Alex still remembers the day she packed her bags and left. It was Sunday, and she was walking to school. On the corner, she saw a man standing outside a strip mall. He had a sign out front that read, "Notorious T-Shirts," and he had a large poster on his wall that read, "I'm not a Mormon. I'm a gay Mormon."

He was a Mormon too, Alex knew, and he had been taking pictures of other gay Mormons. And he had thrown one of those gay Mormon posters at her.

"I was angry," she says. "I was upset. I was frustrated. I wanted to get out of there."

So she left, still upset from seeing the posters and angry from seeing the man take pictures of her. She didn't know what to do next. She didn't know how to find an apartment or how to find a job. She didn't know how to tell her parents, who she had trusted for so long. And she didn't know how to tell herself that she was going to move forward.

She just wanted to get out,

 as gay. Up to that point, much about her California childhood was typical. The youngest of six children in a staunch Mormon family, she had gotten into some trouble with her parents, but until she identified herself as a lesbian, they allowed her to continue living at home.

Fair enough, she thought. She went along with this and was surprised to find that when they arrived in St. George, they pulled up at another house entirely and her parents announced that this was where Alex was going
==================== COMPLETION 227 ====================
 to live for the rest of her life.

"So, I'm like, 'OK, I guess that's the house I'm going to live in,'" Alex says. "I was like, 'I don't know, I don't know, you're not really sure?'"

But her parents didn't care. "They just told me I was going to be living with them until I was 18 years old," she recalls. "That was it. I don't know why I didn't think this through. I mean, God forbid my parents find out I'm a lesbian, I'd probably be in some kind of trouble, you know? It was just so cruel. I would have never thought of that."

Before long, Alex was not just making friends at school, but getting some of them to date her as well. And when she was 16, she attended a youth group with a group of young men who were open about their homosexuality. As she recalls it, the only word she heard them say during the youth group was, "What are we doing today?"

"I was really surprised," Alex recalls, "because they were completely open with us. Like, they were like, 'We care about you, we're glad you're here, we don't judge you, and we'd never hurt you or make you feel bad.' And I was like, 'Wow.'"

She was also seeing her first love – an older, straight male couple – and their relationship was getting close enough that she was aware that Alex's parents had been concerned about it. So she went to them and said, "I'm actually gay, and I'm in a relationship. I'm not sure whether I want to come home with you guys or not."

"I was so surprised," she says, "because they were like, 'We know you're going to be with us to the end. We're going to be there for you.' And I was like, 'OK, I understand how you feel.' They were so accepting of me."

But then, at 18, she left home again and moved in with her boyfriend. "I don't know why I did it," she says. "I don't know, I just did."

The next year, she was working on a Mormon mission in South Korea when she met a man, Lee, who was also on a mission. They were married in the Salt Lake Temple, and shortly after that, they moved to Utah.

Lee and Alex were shepherded to Utah by their bishop, and they went through a lot of red tape and procedures to get Alex approved for a temple recommend. They had to go through the motions of having a baptismal interview and a probationary period, and later, they had to go through a formal repentance and baptism [for] their first and second marriage, respectively. It took a long time, but by the time they were done, Alex had been approved for a temple recommend and had been able to attend the temple for the first time in her life.

Lee and Alex were both active members of the local branch of the LDS Church, which meant they could go to church together and hold each other accountable for their faith. "It kind of became part of our family," Alex says. "It became like a family."

She and Lee were both active, regular members of the LDS Church. They had a close relationship with their wives, and they had a close relationship with the bishop. They loved being active members of the church, and they loved their bishop.

"He's just a wonderful person," Alex says. "He's just so sweet, and so kind."

 too.

She was immediately told to pack up and leave. Her dad even showed her pictures of her friends and neighbors who'd accepted her.

"I thought, 'Well, this is the place that lets me be gay?' " she says. "I thought, 'Are they going to let me be gay? If I go there, I'm going to be the only gay in the church there.' "

She ran, and her only contact with her parents for the next three years was through letters and phone calls from her grandparents. By this point, she had moved from state to state, and her parents had accumulated about 50 children, so they were able to arrange for her to stay the night once a week.

"I hadn't experienced anything like that," she says.

She spent her nights with her grandparents. Her "gay" friends didn't exist. It was lonely for her, but her grandparents gradually learned to accept her, even though it was difficult.

"They were just really loving," she says. "They were really kind to me. They didn't ask me questions or challenge me or anything. I remember all the times I was crying, because I was so scared to leave them, but they were so understanding."

Then one night, Alex was sitting on the floor with her grandmother when her mother came home from church with her boyfriend. As Alex and her grandmother watched in horror, her mother told her to run. She went to get her boyfriend, who was waiting for her in the hallway.

"She just ran out of the house," Alex says. "She's so strong and I couldn't believe she just left me. I ran after her. I ran after her."

She ran into the street. After a minute, she looked back and saw her mother's boyfriend standing there with a gun.

"I was just scared," Alex says. "I was scared of him. I was scared he was going to kill me."

Alex's grandmother began screaming. Her mother and boyfriend ran away, but the gun was still pointed at them. Alex heard her grandmother screaming for her mother to get out of the house.

"I tried to run after them and I started running, but a cop pulled up and he said, 'Get back in the house,' " Alex says. "I was like, 'Wait, I'm a victim of domestic violence.' I was like, 'I'm a lesbian, and I'm being attacked.' "

She did not understand what she was being told. She was so scared.

"I remember thinking, 'Am I going to be killed?' " she says. "I started to cry. I thought, 'I'm going to die.' "

She tried to go back inside. She tried to go back inside and say, 'I'm a lesbian.' But the cop said, 'I'm a cop, and if you try to go back in, you're going to be arrested.' "

A cop, who was married, showed up and told Alex that her grandmother had suffered a stroke.

"And I was like, 'That's not true. I'm a lesbian. I'm not a victim of domestic violence,' " Alex says. "And he was like, 'I'm going to arrest you. I'm going to arrest your mother.' "

Alex was taken in by a friend in St. George, and then again by a friend in Las Vegas. She called her parents, who were devastated. They moved in with her grandparents in Salt Lake City, and her mother was later able to work part time at a local college.

He had belief in me, as did Claudio Ranieri and without that move, without him putting his money on the table and doing that... I had another offer, to go to Leeds and no disrespect to Leeds, but things might have gone slightly differently.

Claudio was the man, the manager, who made the decision. I met him when I first went to Chelsea and he showed great belief in me, he improved my game no end in the three years I played under him.

For this year I have to thank Roman Abramovich. I know what you're thinking: thanks very much for that five-year deal I signed last year and I'll be back knocking on the door in a couple of years.

You have to understand this man and it's not easy when you see it from the outside. What the man does is he comes in the changing room, win or lose, and shows the emotion that every fan shows and he really means it - and to the
==================== COMPLETION 229 ====================
 other players too.

To have that faith and belief, a manager can see that you have what it takes. He's not just looking out for his own benefit. He's looking out for the benefit of the group.

In that room you know you will be treated with respect and someone will be watching you.

When Claudio arrived, he was a manager who had won in the Premier League. After very little time he won the league.

He was the man that everyone wanted; he had experienced that winning and he was the man who won. He's a man who really knew how to win.

I was impressed by him. I'd seen him win the league in a different league and then he won in the Premier League. He was a different type of manager.

He had experience in the Premier League but he was a young manager and he had the confidence and the belief to believe in me.

I played under him in the Champions League and the same goes for Claudio at Chelsea. It's a different footballing philosophy, but we've got a great team and we're a lot closer than we were at the time I left.

I'm very grateful to Claudio. I think he is a fantastic manager and I'm extremely proud to be able to say I played under him at Chelsea.

I'm not in the same position as some of the others. I'm nowhere near as well known as some of the players.

Chelsea fans will think 'if he was here, he would have been a hero'. They will remember me as a player, but I played a lot of games and I wasn't a big name, so it's a bit difficult to get the recognition you'd like, but I'm thankful for that.

I'm still going to watch and I'll be watching as much as I can and I'll be watching as much as I can get my hands on.<|endoftext|>The last time I was in Germany, I had a farm & rented a large house. My German and English were terrible but I was able to communicate with farm owners and locals. We did a lot of shopping together and I was able to buy most of the things I needed. I now live in New Zealand and have travelled very little in Europe. I don't really have a lot of friends that I can talk to about my experiences in Germany. That's why I decided to share some of what I've learned about learning German for travel.

1. You are going to be asked a lot of questions.

You are going to be asked a lot of questions and you will have to give an answer. It's going to be in the form of a question or an opinion. You are going to have to look at the person who is asking the question and try to figure out what they are trying to get at. They may not even know the answer and you are going to have to explain it to them. They may not understand it either.

2. People will be trying to speak to you.

You will be having a conversation with friends and strangers. You will be having a conversation with local farmers and farmers will ask you questions about what you are doing and why you are there. People will be trying to talk to you. If they don't understand you they will just walk away or ask another question.

3. It's not real language.

When you speak German to someone in the UK you are speaking to them in a different language. However, you are still able to understand each other. This is one of the things that I think is most frustrating about learning German.

4. It's hard to communicate.

It's very hard to communicate with

==================== COMPLETION 230 ====================
 fans who were very loyal to Chelsea and still are, that's appreciated.

I have to say that I've never done anything to disappoint Roman. I don't know what you've seen of me, but I've always been the same guy, the same player, the same person.

I've never been a player who has wanted to mess about. I've always tried to help the team as best I could, and that's how I've got to be around here.

I've had a good season in terms of trophies, but that's not the main thing. The main thing is getting the best out of myself and playing as well as I can.

I'm in a great position right now, from what I've seen of others this season. It's not about them, it's not about me. It's about the team.

I'm here because I think I can help the team win. I'm not the guy who's going to score the goals, that's not in my nature.

I'm going to be a good player for the team. I'm not going to be a great player, I'm not going to be a great player of course, but I'm going to be a good player. I know what I can do for the team.

If I see a chance, I'll take it. If I see a better opportunity, I'll take it.

I've been lucky. I've had the opportunity to play with some great players and I've been able to learn from them.

I have to thank some players for their advice, like Frank Lampard, John Terry, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, Michael Essien and Didier Drogba, and Lassana Diarra.

I've had the chance to learn from them and those guys have helped me a lot.

I've also had a lot of fantastic coaches, like Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane. They've helped me a lot.

I've spoken to Zidane about how to play more like him and he said something that really stuck in my head, that he's not the best player in the world. He's got a lot of talent.

He's really a genius. He's a genius, he's a genius.

I think I can go on and on, but I think it's more important to just say thank you to the fans.

Thank you all very much for the support you've given me. I have to say thank you to the people of Chelsea.

I've had the chance to play here, I've had the opportunity to play in the Champions League and I've had the chance to play for England.

I've had a lot of different things and I've had a lot of good experiences, but I just want to thank the fans, the supporters, for the support that they've given me.

Thank you very much for that.<|endoftext|>Jan 12, 2013 - 1 post - ‎1 author

The NFL has taken to doing this year's season schedule release in advance of the Super Bowl, and this year they were so confident in the popularity of the Baltimore Ravens they listed the team as the most popular team in the NFL with NBC's ratings.

The ratings were announced this morning, as well as the top 10 most popular teams in the league. Baltimore and New England dominated the top-10 and tied for third place.

The Ravens were followed by the Pittsburgh Steelers, Indianapolis Colts, Denver Broncos, New Orleans Saints, San Francisco 49ers, Tennessee Titans, Chicago Bears, and Green Bay Packers, taking up the top five spots.

The ratings were reported by the NFL via Twitter. This is the first time in the history of the ratings that the NFL has announced them in advance.

The Ravens were listed as the top team in the league, beating out the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The ratings were a surprise to many, as was the ranking of the Broncos in the top-10. The Broncos were also the least watched team in the league, with the highest viewership for the Chiefs, Saints, and Seahawks.

The NFL has been trying to move away from television ratings as a measurement, but it seems the ratings are still important to the league. The ratings are the only way the league can gauge the popularity of its teams.

The top 10 most popular teams in the league with NBC ratings were the San Francisco 49ers, New Orleans Saints, Indianapolis Colts, Chicago Bears, Pittsburgh Steelers and Denver Broncos.

Now, David's job description is pretty standard for a manager in the software industry. He's the boss, and he's responsible for all the things that the employees can't do. He's responsible for recruiting, training, managing the company's projects, managing the operations of the company, and more.

David didn't have a lot of meetings or phone calls to attend. He didn't have to worry about a big budget. He didn't have a lot of responsibilities as a manager. And yet, he was pretty unhappy.

"I don't feel like I have any control over anything." David said. "My team is good. I have a great project to work on, but I don't have control over the projects."

David's problem was that his company was adopting a new technology. The team had been using the old technology for several years, and it was working just fine. David wanted to make the transition to the new technology as smooth and painless as possible.

But when he tried to figure out how to make the transition, he quickly realized that he didn't have a good handle on what was going on.

"Everyone is just doing the same thing. How do I make this transition smooth and painless?" he asked.

I ran into David in the parking lot a few days later. He was talking to a friend about how he was having trouble dealing with the new technology.

"I'm not sure I know how to make the transition smooth and painless." David said. "I need more time to figure out everything."

"That sounds like you're having some trouble dealing with the new technology," I said.

"Yeah," David said. "I can't find the answers."

The challenge I see in David's problem was that he wasn't using the right tool for the job.

Based on my experience as a manager and a founder of Boomerang, I'd like to share with you some of the most common mistakes I see new founders make when dealing with this issue:

Mistake #1: Thinking You Have More Control than You Really Do

When a startup is just starting out, it's easy to think you have more control than you really do. You're building something new, and you've done a lot of research into how other companies have done things before you.

You're thinking, "If we just do this, this will work".

You're thinking that you can make a decision for something that isn't based on anything you've actually done. You're thinking that you can't fail.

There are two big problems with that idea:

You don't have enough experience. You don't have the right tools.

The first problem comes from the fact that we're just starting out. We're building something new. We're building something that's different than anything we've ever built before.

The second problem comes from the fact that we're building a product that's not an operating system. It's not a web application. It's not a product. It's just something.

That's a huge sum that would allow the U.S. to go nuclear to deal with the Islamic State and other threats. It would also pay for everything from the National Defense Authorization Act to the Obama administration's plan to give the president more power over the Pentagon.

By contrast, the U.S. spends $1.1 trillion annually on Medicare. It's not even close.

This is the second time in a year that a new report has been released on the Pentagon's black budget. And the CRS report is even more damning than the first one. The first was released in November 2015 and was titled "America's Military Bases: A Threat to Global Security?" The new report says, "The United States is spending more on defense than it does on all other government agencies combined."

The CRS report places the cost of the U.S. military budget in perspective by comparing it with the $5.7 trillion spent on all other government agencies, and then adding in the $1.2 trillion that the Pentagon spends annually. Combined with the $500 billion that is sent to the Pentagon in "black" money, the U.S. spends $600 billion a year on defense.

The CRS report says that the U.S. spends more on defense than on all other government agencies combined, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education, and interest on the national debt. The report is titled "America's Military Bases: A Threat to Global Security?"

The history of the United States dollar begins in 1782 with the adoption of the Continental Dollar. This denomination was created by the Continental Congress to replace the Continental Dollar and its gold content. The new currency was backed by the gold of the thirteen American colonies. In 1816, Congress passed the first system of currency notes, the Greenbacks. They were made of a silver-plated paper backed by greenbacks receivable in the states. The Greenbacks were replaced in 1836 by the Federal Reserve System, which was created under the law of the country. The Federal Reserve System is the central bank in the United States.


The United States is now a well-established nation with a large economy. It is a safe haven for investors seeking quality investment products. The United States government has been a strong supporter of the environment and has been known to provide assistance for those looking to leave their country of origin. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and therefore, there are many ethnic groups that have contributed to the nation. The value of the dollar is derived from the value of the gold and silver that it contains.


The design of this coin was approved by the Continental Congress in 1782. The design became official in 1792 with the adoption of the United States Constitution.<|endoftext|>Wednesday, September 27, 2018

 pioneer and explorer, John Wesley Powell, visited in 1859. He found it extended over a distance of only 330 yards, with a depth of only about 100 feet.

Powell's notes show it to be a large, shallow lake, so large, perhaps, that it was not difficult to guess that the water was very salty. At the time of Powell's visit it was dry as a bone, having an altitude of only 40 to 75 feet above the surrounding level. The surface is divided into three distinct sections, the lower one being so muddy as to be dangerous for treading, and the upper two are so muddy that it would be a bad idea to walk or drive over them. Powell's account, however, is not complete. He describes several bays, but he does not give any information concerning their depth. He says that "the distance from the western boundary of this lake to the southern extremity of the flat, which is the true southern boundary of the lake, is about 8 miles." That is not quite correct, for the lake is separated from the surrounding country by the N. slope of a mountain range, and there is no reason to suppose that it is not equally distant from all other points on the Colorado.

The historical value of Powell's observations is well understood. He mentions that the lake is surrounded by the desert, but he gives no other information at this time. It is not difficult to guess that the lake is at this time dry, because the next year it was dry as a bone. The first person to discover the lake was, however, a person who heard the story from the Indians, and that person was Captain Bridger, who was the first white man to cross the lake without the aid of a boat.

The northern limits of the lake are still unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be somewhat less than 1,000 miles long. It is not uncommon for cross-country skiers to be blown down a mountain by the pressure of the snow. It is not, however, uncommon for them to cut their rope and fall into the lake. It was a most active river in the early years of the century, with great rapids and shoals, and the great majority of attempts to cross the lake have been made on the southern side, the camp being placed on the shore of the lake.

The lake is not very shallow, the water being about 130 feet deep. It is, however, mainly a salt water, and the water is continuously brackish, and the lake has no artificial plant life.

A section of the river, the Snake River, is still much deeper than the Great Salt Lake. The Snake runs parallel with the Platte, about 140 miles above the lake. The Snake River is a tributary of the Platte, flowing north-northeastward, arriving at its junction with the Colorado about 30 miles above the lake. The Snake runs in a southerly direction, and it is seldom very deep. The inlet is about 20 miles long, and the outlet is about 30 miles long. The Snake River is one of the most productive of the Colorado rivers, and it is a great tributary of the river of the same name. The Snake is navigable until the water rises to the depth of about 50 feet, at which time the rapids become very dangerous. It is now the most famous stream in the Rocky Mountains.

The Culpeper River, which rises in the mountains about 25 miles above the Great Salt Lake, is a tributary of the Platte. It is navigable to about 50 feet, and it has a rather shallow outlet.

The lake has a large and beautiful harbor with a well-beaten stone pier

 arrival of the first Europeans. The Indian tribes from which the lake was supposed to have been obtained, were of the Nez Perce, Mescalero, and Apache, who lived within a few miles of the lake. The Indians, however, did not know of the geography of the country beyond the lake; "they had no knowledge even of the mountains of the Pacific," so they were not able to make a general map of the region. The only maps which have been made of the region are those of the Swedish explorer, Åkesson, who spent a year in California, and of Captain Carl Akeley, who made a journey to the Pacific coast in 1874. The maps of these two explorers are excellent, and show, for example, the course of the San Francisco Bay and the interior of the state.

The mountain tribes of the valley of the San Francisco Bay, as well as the desert tribes, were in the habit of gathering in the mountains near the lake, and of travelling in the snow from the lake to the mountains. While the mountain tribes were gathering, the river valleys were filled with fish and game; the valley of the San Francisco Bay was entirely flooded with water and was covered with fish. The Indians were not very fond of the water; they preferred to live with the snow and ice in the mountains, with their animals in the valleys, and in the snow, or ice, with their game. The plains were covered with grass and game, and people could live without the sun and without the water. There was plenty of game on the plains, and the cattle lived in the mountains, and the Indians were expert hunters. The country was rich in game, and the country was infested with wild beasts and insects.

The mountain tribes occupied the valleys of the San Francisco Bay and the mountains west of the lake. The valleys were peopled with the same condition of animals and people as the mountain regions. The plains were inhabited by the same condition of animals, and the people were the same as the mountain people. The mountains were inhabited by the same condition of animals and people as the plains; but the climate was generally milder and the people were accustomed to live with the lakes, rather than with the plains. The mountains were covered with snow, and the grazing animals were able to live without the sun, or without water. The river valleys were always covered with water and marsh. The Indians were able to live without the sun and without water, but they were not accustomed to live without the mountains. The plains were peopled with the same animals and people as the mountains, but the climate was more temperate. The plains were not covered with water, but they were covered with grass and game, and the people were expert hunters. The plains were inhabited by the same animals as the mountains, but the climate was milder and the people were accustomed to live with the lakes, rather than with the plains.

The Indian tribes whom we have just mentioned occupied the valleys of the San Francisco Bay and the mountains west of the lake, and the river valleys were peopled by the same animals and people as those of the mountains.

 discovery of the Grand Canyon, and of the great Salt Lake.

Abandoned by the first settlers in 1829, the lake's waters were soon crossed by the railway, which has been on the right bank of the lake since 1885. The railroad cuts the line into two, one to the right, the other to the left. The first bridge over the lake was made in 1877 by the construction of a trestle, and the train stopped at Ogden in 1883 for repairs. The last bridge was completed in 1888.

The lake is divided into three parts, the western, eastern, and southern, and is about 75 m. long by 15 m. wide. The western part, which is more uninhabited than the other two, is largely grass; the eastern is more wooded, and the southern is fringed with sand and gravel. The lake's central divide is clearly marked by the natural sand dune, which is about 250 m. high, and has an area of nearly 100,000 acres.

The population of Great Salt Lake is about 30,000, and the lake is said to contain about 1,500,000,000 gallons of water. The total area of the lake is 54,400 acres. The lake has an average depth of 4 ft. and a maximum of 12 ft. The original surface is mostly sand and gravel, and the water is probably salt. The lake is a place of much religious interest, and the monastic order of the Franciscans has a summer residence in the Lake.

The lake has a number of springs, the most important of which are the Sac and Fox, the Muddy and Mud Springs, and the Waterloo and Ganges Springs. The lakeshore is strongly timbered, and there are several trees growing on the banks of the lake. The lake has a great many fine lakeshore trails, and is a favourite place for cross-country skiing, but the lake is not suited for the transportation of freight.

The lake is also a place where the waters of the North and South Fork of the Great Salt Lake join. The waters of the South Fork are regarded by some as the lesser of the two, and are said to be of a lower quality. The waters of the North Fork, however, are considered to be the finest, and are known as the "Salt Lake of the North Fork." These waters are not all of the same quality, but are generally considered to be of good quality. The water of the North Fork is navigable for small boats, and the water of the South Fork is not so navigable.

The town of Great Salt Lake, located on the west side of the lake, was established in 1873, and is a post office, post office, post office, post office, post office, post office, post office. It has a city hall, a post office, a post office, a post office, a post office, a post office, a post office, a post office, a post office, a post office, a post office, a post office, a post office.

The water of the lake is used for irrigation, and it is a popular swimming place.

The lake has a number of excellent trout streams and large trout lakes. There are also trout lakes and salmon streams on the west side of the lake, on the eastern shore of the lake, and in the northern part of the lake. The western shore of the lake is rich in fish. The Salt Lake is known as the "Salt-Lake" of Utah, and is the largest lake in the state.

 advent of the railroad.

The first discovery of salt in Great Salt Lake was made by the San Francisco line of the Southern Pacific, in 1881. Salt, the material of which was obtained from a mine 20 m. below the lake, was shipped to the home depot of the railroad engineers and lavatories for use in its moving machinery. In 1884 the Salt Lake Elevated Railway Company opened a salt works on its tracks, which opened in 1887, and was subsequently used for the moving of coal and salt to the various pumping stations of the railroad. A salt works was opened on the railroad in 1892, and in 1894 the Great Salt Lake Elevated Railroad Company constructed a salt works and the Salt Lake Railroad Company, a connection still in use.

Salt was first discovered in the lake in 1836, when a mine was opened at Ogden. The mine was discovered by Mr. William H. Ogden, who after a trial of several months discovered the existence of salt in the lake in 1837. The mine was commenced in 1838 by an American party, and worked by the San Francisco and Ogden train in 1839. The following year Mr. Alfred D. Curtis opened a mine in Ogden. A mine of the San Francisco and Ogden line, of the Colorado and Utah line, of the Utah Central and Eastern lines, and of the Southern Pacific, continued to be operated. A mine of the Southern Pacific was opened in Ogden in 1867.

Salt was found in the lake in 1879 by the Colorado and Utah line, and in 1882 by the Utah line. The mine was opened in 1883 by the Southern Pacific, and in 1884 the Salt Lake and Southern Pacific line each began operating a mine. The Utah and Colorado lines also began operating their mines in 1884.

The mine was operated by the Southern Pacific and Southern Pacific lines until 1887, when the Colorado and Utah lines resumed operations. The mine was operated by the Colorado and Utah line in 1887, with the stocking of the mine for the use of the chemicals and the pump house, and by the Southern Pacific in 1891, with the stocking of the mine for the use of the chemicals and the pump house.

There is also a stone, but it is a salt-stone that makes people live for a long time; so that they can live for centuries. And the city of the hollow earth is ten thousand miles away, and the people there are very much hurt, and they are very much frightened.

I was only nineteen years old when I left home, and I had no father but what I had left, and you know, I was small and weak, and I didn't know how to work. I had to make my own clothes, and I did not have the money to buy any. I had a rag-net to tie my clothes around, and I had to use it, and I had to sew it, and I had to sew my own clothes, and I had to do it all by hand, and I worked so hard, and I was so poor. I was a young man; I was a very young man, and I had no such advantage as I have now. Now I have a great privilege. I have a father and a mother, but I don't know what to say to them, because I do not know how to do any of them." 11 The Explorer of the Hollow Earth "I have been up near the hollow earth, and I have seen the city of the hollow earth, which is very beautiful, and I have seen the people in it, and I have seen the salt-stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the city of the hollow earth, and I have seen the people in it, and I have seen the salt-stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the city of the hollow earth, and I have seen the people in it, and I have seen the salt-stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the city of the hollow earth, and I have seen the people in it, and I have seen the salt-stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the city of the hollow earth, and I have seen the people in it, and I have seen the salt-stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the city of the hollow earth, and I have seen the people in it, and I have seen the salt-stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the city of the hollow earth, and I have seen the people in it, and I have seen the salt-stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the stone that makes them live for a long time, and I have seen the city of the hollow earth, and I

 but the Indian say that it is round. The Spanish say that it is round, but the French say that it is hollow. The English say that it is hollow, but the Indians say that it is round. Such is the diversity of opinions and the diversity of experience among most people in many lands. Now, I have heard something of a hollow earth. I think that I heard it from the mouth of a rude Indian in the forests of Oregon. I heard it from the mouth of a savage in the mountains of West Virginia. I heard it from the mouth of a braggart, who came to my cabin on a spree. I heard it from the mouth of an Indian in the woods of New York, who was so sure of his own wisdom that he wanted to believe that he could speak on this subject to an audience of uninitiated persons. I heard it from the mouth of a hermit, who was a full-grown man, and who had built a lodge in the woods for the purpose of dreaming. I heard it from the mouth of a hermit who lived in the mountains of Georgia, and who had spent his days at a good distance from the civilization of his country, and who had gone to sleep in his habitation at night, and who had not dreamed since the day before yesterday. I heard it from the mouth of a woman who had lived on the prairies of Kansas, and who had been driven from her home when her two young children had been taken from her. I heard it from the mouth of a woman who had lived on the prairies of Missouri, and who had been driven from her home when her husband had been killed in an Indian war. I heard it from the mouth of a woman who had lived on the prairies of Illinois, and who had been driven from her home when her father had been killed in an Indian war. I heard it from the mouth of a woman who had lived on the prairies of Iowa, and who had been driven from her home when her husband had been killed in an Indian war.

But a little further west, in the mountains of Oregon, a hermit lives with his wife and two daughters in a little lodge built in the woods. The weather is always cold, the food cold, and the people cold. On the other side of the mountains, on the banks of the river of the great Columbia, a people who have taken the name of the "Hollow Earth" live with their wives and children on the surface of the earth. The weather is always hot, the food hot, and the people warm. The people who live in the hollow earth have no mouths, but they have ears, and they hear everything that is said and done on the surface of the earth.

But the universe is complex, and the creatures are simple, and it is folly to try to understand a complex by dealing with a simple. And it is equally folly to try to understand a complex by dealing with a simple. The reason why we are misled by the universe is because we cannot conceive of it as a system; we do not believe it to be material, or that it has structure. Our idea of the universe is a vague and confused mass, like a dream, all in confusion and disorder, because we can not conceive of it as a system." ( 242 ) "The universe is a mystical substance, which is not intelligible to us even in its existence. But it is intelligible to ourselves, and we can understand our own existence as a means of understanding the universe, and of transcending it. We can understand that the universe is a system, that it is a series of continuous events, that each of them is a chain of causes and conditions, and that the universe is nothing but a series of these causes and conditions, which are the various combinations of matter in various forms, and which are connected by that series of causes and conditions which we call the causal chain."

But it is intelligible to ourselves, and we can understand our own existence as a means of understanding the universe, and of transcending it. We can understand that the universe is a system,

By now, you may have heard that the GOP-backed Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives is calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood. The panel's members are Reps. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Trent Franks (R-AZ), and their investigation is being led by Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-FL). Reps. Diane Black (R-TN) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) are also members.

The panel's members are using the investigation to try to amend the procedure of the House of Representatives to make it harder for abortion providers to perform abortions. Because the committee is investigating Planned Parenthood rather than, say, the abortion giant HMOs, it is important to know just what the panel is up to.

The Senate's Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, however, is not taking any chances. Nor is the House's Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, which is chaired by Rep. Diane Black (R-TN).

The court's decision to hear a case on California's Proposition 8 was a blow to supporters of same-sex marriage in the United States, who had hoped to convince the high court to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between one man and one woman.

But it is likely to lead to further bans in other states where same-sex marriage has been legal, according to lawyers representing same-sex couples who say they are being denied the right to marry.

"It seems to me that it's only a matter of time until the majority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges is seen as the beginning and the end of the matter for all these state-level marriage laws," said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.

"They are simply too weak to withstand the sustained assault of logic, reason and law."

The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that same-sex couples are entitled to the same federal benefits as married couples under the Constitution.

The case, Hollingsworth v. Perry, was brought by two same-sex couples who wanted to be married in California, but were denied the right to marry there.

The high court issued an emergency stay on Proposition 8, stopping its implementation.

When the Supreme Court hears cases this term, it hears from the opposing parties, meaning that the court will hear arguments on such controversial issues as same-sex marriage.

What does the ruling mean?

The Supreme Court's opinion in Hollingsworth v. Perry was unanimous in its opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, said that the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional.

"Marriage is a fundamental right," Kennedy wrote.

"No union is more profound. No union is ideal."

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion for a five-justice majority, in which he said that the court will not rule on the constitutionality of Proposition 8 for the time being.

Roberts wrote that he would "hold our hands up and say we didn't do enough to defend Prop 8" and that the case is "just now, if ever, ripe to be considered by the court."

The chief justice said the majority opinion would likely be appealed to the

 and their illegal identity: In fact, schools will no longer be able to take any student who cannot prove they are here legally.

You'd impound all payments to Mexico: This will have a two-fold effect. Illegal immigrants will no longer be able to send ill gotten gains to Mexico, and the Mexican government will be forced to take a more active role in preventing immigrants from going into the United States. You'd end of sanctuary cities: Cities will no longer have the power to defy federal law. And you'd end birthright citizenship. If you are born to two illegal immigrants, you will not be given U.S. citizenship. If you are born to people here temporarily, you will not be given U.S. citizenship. To borrow Mitt Romney's term of "self-deportation," I think these policies would encourage many illegals to decide it's not worth to stay it if their kids cannot get an education and they cannot get work. In terms of rounding up those who do remain, you can give local police additional resources in terms of money and manpower. If they're already overwhelmed, then they could use the new officers even after the immigration problem is finished or at least reduced. I do see the need to prevent the rise of an
==================== COMPLETION 261 ====================
 underground economy by cracking down on all forms of illegal immigration. If you're willing to do that, there is no need to enact draconian measures that would make people less likely to come to the United States.

If you have not read the article, I recommend it. It's short and clean and gets right to the point. And you would have to be an idiot not to read it as you consider the following:

One thing that has been missing from the debate over immigration is the distinction between "legal" and "illegal" immigrants. American citizens can enter the U.S. legally, and illegal immigrants can enter the U.S. illegally. But they are not the same thing. The U.S. needs both legal and illegal immigrants. The U.S. economy is based on people coming to the U.S. to work. If the U.S. were to cut off legal immigration, it would also cut off the economic engines of the U.S., because there are jobs to be found.

The bottom line: There is no need to increase the number of deportations. If you have a law enforcement goal that you need to achieve, then go after people who are breaking the law. But if you want to encourage people to come to the U.S. legally, then you need to deal with illegal immigration.

The article also addresses the idea of a path to citizenship that would include amnesty, which is a bad idea. His summary:

In the end, the debate over immigration must focus on the number of people who come to this country legally, not the motivations of those who have come here illegally. The number of illegal immigrants has declined dramatically. So what's the problem? It is that employers have no incentive to recruit people if they know the Border Patrol is going to round them up and deport them. If the U.S. were to adopt a strategy of amnesty for illegal immigrants, the U.S. economy would collapse. People would stop coming to the U.S. for work. Those who do come for work would find it harder to find jobs. It is not the government's job to fill jobs that are not already available.

This is a good summary of the argument I had in my recent column. But I'd add a couple of points. First, I think the economic argument is correct for the following reasons:

The U.S. needs both legal and illegal immigrants. The U.S. economy is based on people coming to the U.S. to work. If the U.S. were to cut off legal immigration, it would also cut off the economic engines of the U.S., because there are jobs to be found. The main reasons people do not come here legally are not the costs of coming here, but the costs of staying here.

Second, the timing of this debate is wrong. It's not wrong to address the issue of illegal immigration in the context of the economy. But it is wrong to ignore the economic needs of illegal immigrants. They need jobs. They need education. They need housing. They need health care. They need food. They need transportation. They need culture. They need a sense of community.

I'm not sure whether this is the best idea, but it's a good one.

 illegal illegal class of citizens. You'd end the Dream Act: This would end the sole type of type of illegal immigrant program that has been in existence since the 1970s and allow these children to be brought into the U.S. legally. On the other hand, ending this program would be a disaster for the Democrats. They would force them to take a hard stand against illegal immigration and they would have to take a stand against the left's dream.

You'd end birthright citizenship: The Democratic Party's weak position on illegal immigration would be fortified. This would force them to take a stand against the left's dream. You'd end illegal immigration by force: This would force the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to seriously enforce our borders. It would force them to create a department that would focus on the enforcement of immigration law. And it would force them to criminalize illegal immigration.

You'd end sanctuary cities: Cities would no longer have the power to defy federal law. The federal government would have to get involved in enforcing the law. This would stop the predictable rise of the sanctuary movement.

To put it simply, this would be a disaster for Democrats. The Dream Act would be end to the dream in an instant and the Sanctuary Cities would be destroyed. There would be all kinds of new problems for Democrats, and the Republican Party would have to take a stand against illegal immigration.

We could end the Dream Act too, but that's a whole other topic.<|endoftext|>A couple of weeks ago I had a chat with a friend, who asked me what my opinion was of our local community. I replied that I thought it was pretty good – I think the local people are generally quite friendly.

Well, apparently they weren't as friendly as they thought.

The local government has been advised by the Welsh Government to use the new devolution settlement to impose a ban on advertising for payday loans, savers' credit unions and personal loans.

The new government has stated that it is considering imposing a ban on the advertising of payday loans, savers' credit unions and personal loans which "might be exploitative or misleading".

A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: "We are considering how to ensure that local authorities have the powers they need to protect consumers and make sure that local authorities have the tools to enforce their advertising codes. That is why the Welsh Government has received detailed advice from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment on how to implement the new powers in law."

However, the Welsh Government has also stated that it is "committed to supporting the development of new lending and finance options for consumers and that powerful new powers will be forthcoming later this year to protect consumers from unfair payday and other lending practices."

I think we can all agree that payday loans and credit unions are pretty exploitative – so it would make sense that the Government would be looking to ban them from being advertised.

But what about savers' credit unions?

Well, they are also pretty exploitative.

They are basically a bank run on savers.

They charge an annual fee of £150 for a credit union account, and £150 a year for a savings account.

The cash you are saving in your savings account is often used to pay off your credit union's annual fee, or to pay for loans which they are offering people.

Credit unions have been shown to be an outlet for people who have been unable to save for retirement.

These people generally are the most vulnerable in the community – there are very few jobs with decent pensions and savings, and people earning low wages are often forced to rely on credit unions to get a foothold in the workforce.

Further, credit unions are often

 "illegals only" culture, but that requires enforcement of the law.

But what about schools?

I think you'll find that the biggest impact of this policy will be on the education of our children.

As you know, school choice does not work in the United States. There are over 300,000 public schools in the United States. If you take a random sample, you would find that only about 3 percent of these schools are privately run. The vast majority of the schools are public schools and you would find that the vast majority of the students in those public schools are students of color. If we were to remove the illegals from U.S. schools, the racial achievement gap would likely immediately fall.

So, what happens to our public schools?

I think we have to open them up to the children of illegals, in order to make up for the loss of federal funds and the loss of access to the education of children from these schools, and I think that we should do it through a combination of incentives and sanctions.

For example, we could use the funds that the federal government gives to states to provide scholarships to students from public schools. There are over 900,000 students from the public schools who are recipients of these scholarships. If you took these students out of the public schools and sent them to a private school, you would see a dramatic reduction in the achievement gap.

Restricting undocumented parents to one child will also have a positive impact on the achievement of our children. I think the best way to do this is to use the resources we give to parents to put forth the kind of efforts that I mentioned earlier, incentivizing parents to maintain two children and, in so doing, educating them and building their future.

It is true that the majority of unauthorized immigrants are children of parents who have come here illegally, but I think there are still many small children out there who live with their parents who will receive an education if they are allowed to stay. This is a good way to make up for lost federal funds.

Now, I'm not suggesting any of these policies will happen right away. The precise details will depend on what the President wants to do and what Congress does. But these are some of the ideas that I have been working on. I suggest that you talk to your local members of Congress about these ideas and see what they think.

More than anything, I think we should fight this fight now. Our kids are counting on us.<|endoftext|>The United States Supreme Court has ruled that in the future, the U.S. government will not be able to exempt itself from laws that protect the privacy of U.S. citizens. The opinion that was handed down on Monday is the latest in a series of important decisions that have been handed down regarding surveillance and privacy rights.

The case that is causing such a stir is the case of U.S. v. Jones. It involves a U.S. citizen named Jones who was arrested in 2006 and charged with possession of child pornography. The evidence that was found on his computer was used to charge him with a federal felony. But his data was later destroyed, which meant that he was unable to be brought to trial.

The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the government could have exempted itself from the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The court voted unanimously to uphold the law that required the government to obtain a warrant before searching the defendant's computer. The majority opinion stated that it is "important to recognize that the Fourth Amendment protects an individual's right to be secure in his physical possession and in his effects. . . . The right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures is a fundamental right."

 "American Taliban," but given the current political climate, I think this will be easier said than done.

Cronyism: The immigration bill includes a provision that says that if you have a child who is American citizen, they will become a U.S. citizen. If you have a child who is not, then you will not be able to take the child to the United States. That, in turn, would create a "burden" on the government because the child would not become a citizen. Trump seems to think that a child who is born in the United States to illegal immigrants, regardless of his/her parents' status, is permanently a citizen. That's the agenda of the Liberal Party, which has not been shy about promoting its agenda through its "citizenship" program. We should not be looking to the government to help any American citizen gain citizenship. All we should need is a prosecutor to get all illegal immigrants off the street and a judge to determine whether a child is a citizen.

I think this is the best way to accomplish the goals of stopping illegal immigration and ending birthright citizenship. I'm not suggesting the bill be passed today or at the end of this year. I'm suggesting it's a good idea to look at it now and then take a look at it again in a few years and make a few changes. It's an important topic to debate, and it's one that will continue to pop up as the election approaches.

I realize that the Republican Party has a better chance of winning in November then of getting a bill passed. But I think it's important to debate this issue, because it is a real problem and it's one that we will continue to face as long as the Democrats control the White House and Congress.

In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday, host Megyn Kelly asked the Republican presidential candidate if he supported a constitutional ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which is currently the law in several states.

"I'm pro-life. I'm going to be pro-life until I find out, you know, with the health issues, with the heart issues, with all of the problems that you're talking about," Trump responded.

"With the woman?" Kelly asked.

"Yeah," Trump responded.

He went on to explain his stance on abortion in general, but also during the sixth month of pregnancy.

"When you look at the problem with the 10th month, you look at the problem with the 11th month, I mean, where you can't even see the baby. It's like an arm. And if you go to see it and you're going to have an abortion, you're going to end up having to have an operation. And you have to see the baby. And you can't do that. And the baby's gone," he explained. "And you can't do that."

The truth is, though, that Americans overwhelmingly support a federal ban on abortion after 20 weeks, and Trump's comments seem to indicate that he's more comfortable pushing back against the science of fetal development than in acknowledging the humanity of the unborn.

Trump has made a name for himself by making outrageous statements about abortion, and his campaign website includes a section called "The Best Way to

REBOL is unique in many ways. Its principles emerged over 30 years of language research and development. REBOL takes a different approach; it has different objectives. Most programmers don't get it right away. Some never get it, but those that do gain a new insight into the power a language can provide. They discover a new elegance of expression and computation.

I should also be clear that nothing in the design of REBOL is arbitrary or "done just to be different". There's a reason for everything. You will get a better understanding below.

If you're a computer scientist or professor, here's a summary of the REBOL Design Objectives for Computer Scientists. If you understand what REBOL is really about, I urge you to consider teaching it to your students or others.

Fundamentals

In the domain of computer languages, REBOL is unique in its expressive flexibility and power. It is built on these fundamental concepts:

CONCEPT DESCRIPTION Values, words, blocks The basic elements of the language source form are: values
==================== COMPLETION 265 ====================


words

blocks (also called variables) Constructs are objects of the language, but can be modified and reintroduced at will. Constructs are indeed objects of the language: they have properties, and have methods. However, they are not objects of the language because they are not associated with any data. They are, rather, objects of the REBOL language. In contrast, a variable is an object of the language, because the language keeps track of its value. A word is an object of the language. It has a name, and can be assigned to a value, and has a pronunciation and pronunciation rules. Blocks are a special type of construct of the language, which are objects of the language. They have properties, and can be used as input or output. A block is associated with a value, and can be used as input or output. Block values are of different types. Some are associated with words, some with words, and some with blocks. Blocks can be processed by functions. Functions are objects of the language, and can be used to create new values from existing values and to process values. Functions are associated with blocks. Functions are used to create new words, or to process words and blocks. The REBOL language variables are objects of the language, and are manipulated by functions and blocks. Functions can also be used to manipulate variables. The REBOL language has a variant of the abstract data type, the data type, which is used for storing and manipulating values (and for any other purpose that is appropriate for a type). In general, REBOL programmers use the data type for storing and manipulating values.

REBOL's language model allows you to do almost anything you can do in other languages. This is its unique strength.

An important aspect of the REBOL language is that the blocks are immutable. The language uses the term "block" to refer to an expression, and to refer to a value that contains an expression. A block does not change after it has been assigned a value. A value cannot be created from an expression.

A block's value can be assigned to a variable. If a block is assigned to a variable, then the block's value is associated with the variable. A block's value is safe to take from or give to a different block, and it cannot be assigned to a different variable.

There is no way in the language to create a different block with a different value, and there is no way to reassign an existing block's value.

You cannot assign a value to a block that you do not own. This feature is called assignment.

There is no concept of a stack. A stack is an arbitrary segment of memory used by the language to store values. It is not used for storing blocks.

Blocks and Numbers

REBOL's block type is an object of type "word". The word is an object of type "word" with the property "variable". Intuitively, a word is a number, and a word is an integer. A word can be assigned to a variable. It can also be assigned to a value.

A word has two properties. First, it has a length. Second, it is a variable. These properties are used to control the way I'll use words in this section.

The word "1" is a word and is an integer, and is a word with length 8. It can be assigned to a variable. It can also be assigned to a value.

The word "3" is a word and is a word with length 2. It can be assigned to a variable. It can also be assigned to a value.

It's easy to see that the word

CONCEPT DESCRIPTION Values, words, blocks The basic elements of the language source form are: values
==================== COMPLETION 266 ====================
: numeric, string, boolean, number, boolean or string, or a combination thereof. A value can be any of the following: a numeric value (integer), a string (text), a number (floating point), a boolean (true/false), or a floating point number (real). A value can also be a function call. A value can also contain a list of values (a collection). Blocks are shorthand for a collection of values. Blocks can be nested. Values are emitted in a specific order and depending on the value type. A value can be emitted as a string, a number, a Boolean, a true/false, a floating point number, a function call or an array of values (list). Values can contain whitespace or any other characters. All values and words can be enclosed in braces. A word can be enclosed in parentheses (and in DO-blocks to hold single statements). A block can contain a single statement. A statement can be an expression or a DO-block. Expressions can be nested. Expressions can be chained together. All expressions are evaluated at once by the REBOL compiler. All expressions are evaluated at the same time. The value of an expression is the resultant value. All evaluation is done at compile time. All evaluation is done in constant time. All evaluation is done in constant space. All evaluation is done on the heap. All evaluation is done in constant memory. All evaluation is done in constant time. All evaluation is done in constant space.

REBOL's core value is the ability to express ideas clearly and concisely.

REBOL is not just a language, it is a philosophy. It is a set of principles for how to write, think and communicate.

The REBOL philosophy is that programs should be written to be readable and easy to understand. It is the reason why REBOL is so flexible.

The REBOL philosophy is also why REBOL is a language that allows for syntactic and semantic experimentation.

The REBOL philosophy is also why REBOL is organized into modules.

The REBOL philosophy is also the reason why REBOL programs can be developed in various ways.

REBOL is named after the British mathematician and engineer John McCarthy. The name REBOL was suggested by John's wife, Elizabeth.

==================== COMPLETION 267 ====================


words

blocks of code

Ruby, Python, and JavaScript follow this pattern. REBOL has about as many words and blocks as, or more than, any other language. However, REBOL has a unique structure for each combination of value and block. Values and words are laid out in a structure of blocks, each block containing a collection of values. A basic block of code, a CODE block, contains one or more values and one or more blocks.

REBOL's word/value structure is similar to that of Ruby, Python, and JavaScript. REBOL's keywords are similar to REBOL's blocks. REBOL's block syntax is similar to that of Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.

REBOL blocks can contain a single value or multiple values. REBOL's zero value can also be a symbol.

Block syntax

A REBOL block is a group of words, enclosed by curly braces.

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

A REBOL block can contain any combination of values and blocks. A REBOL block can be a single value or multiple values. REBOL blocks can contain zero or more symbols.

$REBOL_OPTIONAL_BLOCKS = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', ];

For example, the following REBOL blocks are equivalent:

a = 0 b = 0 c = 0 d = 0 e = [] f = [] g = [] h = [] i = [0] j = [] k = [] l = [0,1] m = [] n = [] o = [] p = [] q = [] r = [] s = [] t = [] u = '()' v = [] w = [] x = [] y = {} z = []

Reversed REBOL blocks are syntactically equivalent to REBOL's single value/single block:

a = 0 b = 0 c = 0 d = 0 e = [] f = [] g = [] h = [] i = [] j = [] k = [] l = [0,1] m = [] n = [] o = [] p = [] q = [] r = [] s = [] t = [] u = '()' v = [] w = [] x = [] y = {} z = []

REBOL blocks can have default values. REBOL blocks can have no default values, but they can be enclosed in braces if they should be. For example:

$REBOL_OPTIONAL_BLOCKS = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', ];

You can also enclose a REBOL block in parentheses if you don't want a default:

CONCEPT DESCRIPTION Values, words, blocks The basic elements of the language source form are: values
==================== COMPLETION 268 ====================

They are the units of structure. Modules. Modules are the collections of blocks in REBOL. Functions. Functions are the commands that a programmer uses to manipulate values. Code. Code is the instructions that the programmer uses to manipulate values.

REBOL's design is so fundamental and powerful that I suspect no other language is "designed" to have all these features.

Variables, Subroutines, and Functions

REBOL variables are the smallest type of object in REBOL. They are called constants. They are immutable. They can't be changed. Nothing in REBOL can change them. That's why, in REBOL, variables are used for storing values.

REBOL variables are called subroutines. They can be invoked by user code and are treated as ordinary objects.

REBOL functions are called procedures. They are executed by the programmer and because they're procedures, they can be passed as parameters to other procedures. They can be accessed by user code at any time.

REBOL functions are first class citizens in REBOL. They can be defined, called, called again, and passed in and out of other functions. They can receive input from other functions and can return output to other functions.

REBOL functions also have the structure of a procedure. They can return a value, take a parameter, and return a value. They can also be invoked as subroutines by other procedures.

REBOL functions are the building blocks of REBOL. They are how a programmer manipulates values.

What are the basic values in REBOL? They are constants. The most basic constants in REBOL are:

DOCUMENTATION (DOCSTRING) The text content of a program.

(DOCSTRING) The text content of a program. ERR The error message associated with a program.

The error message associated with a program. HELP The help menu associated with a program.

The help menu associated with a program. HIDE The hide menu associated with a program.

The hide menu associated with a program. PRINT The print menu associated with a program.

The print menu associated with a program. SETUP The setup menu associated with a program.

REBOL variables have a few special characteristics. They are immutable. They can't be changed. Nothing in REBOL can change them. That's why, in REBOL, variables are used for storing values.

REBOL variables are also named. They can have names up to 14 characters long. These are special characters. They are called user-defined characters.

REBOL variables can also have function names. This allows the programmer to create functions with names that are unique to the program.

REBOL variables can be assigned to other variables.

REBOL variables do not support user-defined operators.

REBOL variables can be assigned to other variables and functions.

REBOL variables can have a variable name.

REBOL strings can have extended characters.

REBOL strings can be mutable.

REBOL strings can contain functions.

 health care workforce has been implicated as a contributor to disparities in health care access and health outcomes. The Institute of Medicine concluded that producing a diverse and adequate physician supply, particularly for geographic areas with many poor, racial/ethnic minority, and uninsured residents, is one of several solutions for eliminating health disparities. 1 , 2 In medically underserved areas, both an adequate supply of primary care physicians and greater physician racial-ethnic diversity is associated with decreased disparities in access to care. 3

Using multiple logistic regression models, we determined the odds of working in a HPSA or MUA for physicians in different racial/ethnic groups relative to their white counterparts. Physician age, gender, patient care hours, place of medical school graduation (US or international medical graduate, physician specialty), and board certification were included in the models as covariates. We used studies in the literature to guide our inclusion of these covariates in regression models. 6 – 11 In a second set of regressions models, we performed a regression on each outcome (practice in a HPSA or MUA) after stratifying the sample into 2 separate specialty groupings, a primary care group and a non–primary care group, to explore possible interaction among race, ethnicity, and specialty groups broadly defined.
==================== COMPLETION 269 ====================
 We included race/ethnicity as a continuous variable in the regression models.

The data were used in secondary analyses to determine whether disparities in health care among physicians were similar in the 2 specialty groups. In these analyses, we first compared the average 12-month readmission rates of physicians in primary care specialty groups (primary care physicians and those with a specialty in non-primary care fields) to the average 12-month readmission rates of physicians in non-primary care specialty groups. We then compared the rates of physician age, gender, and specialty among primary care and non-primary care physicians in each specialty group. Finally, we compared the 12-month readmission rates of primary care and non-primary care physicians in the same specialty group. We included diagnostic codes in the secondary analysis for causes of adverse events and death for each primary care group physician to evaluate the association between specialty and readmission rates.

To evaluate the association between specialty and readmission rates, we used a nested case-control study design in which all 2,854 physicians who completed the study were included in the analysis ( ). The nested case-control study design is a design with multiple nested cases. In the case of a primary care group physician, the case is the physician who is the subject of the study and the nested case is the physician who is not the subject of the study. Because this design does not allow for a control for an entire population, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which all 2,854 physicians who completed the study were included in the analysis. We used the same analytic approach as above.

Eligible physicians were aged 50 or older and had completed residency training within the previous 5 years. During the 6 months prior to the study, the physicians completed a physician questionnaire that included demographic information and data on the number of hours they had worked in each specialty. They also completed a 24-hour recording of their work and three-hour resting periods to record their sleep and day of the week (weeks 1, 2, and 3) for each of the years they had studied. Eligible physicians were also considered to have completed a residency if they had completed a residency in the usual year of study attendance.

The study sample included all 2,854 physicians who completed the study (including the 1,838 who were ineligible because of incomplete data). The study sample included patients from all US states and the District of Columbia. The study sample was diverse across racial/ethnic groups. Approximately half of the study sample was white, third- or fourth-generation US-born, and in primary care, and the remainder was non-white, non-US-born, and in non-primary care fields ( ). The sample was also diverse in age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The majority of physicians (86%) were male and more than half (55%) were US born. The sample was also diverse in specialty, with approximately one-third of the sample in primary care and the remainder in non-primary care.

Discussion

In this study, we found that physicians working in primary care specialty groups were more likely to experience readmissions compared to physicians working in non-primary care group practices in the same specialty group. This is consistent with the literature on the association between specialty and readmission rates, which has shown that these groups face similar readmission rates to their non-specialty counterparts.2–5 However, this study also found that physicians in primary care group practices were less likely to experience an adverse event than physicians in non-primary care specialty groups. This is consistent with the literature on the association between specialty and adverse event rates, which has shown that non-specialty physicians with a specialty in non-primary care fields are more likely to experience adverse events

 health care workforce has been implicated as a contributor to disparities in health care access and health outcomes. The Institute of Medicine concluded that producing a diverse and adequate physician supply, particularly for geographic areas with many poor, racial/ethnic minority, and uninsured residents, is one of several solutions for eliminating health disparities. 1 , 2 In medically underserved areas, both an adequate supply of primary care physicians and greater physician racial-ethnic diversity is associated with decreased disparities in access to care. 3

Using multiple logistic regression models, we determined the odds of working in a HPSA or MUA for physicians in different racial/ethnic groups relative to their white counterparts. Physician age, gender, patient care hours, place of medical school graduation (US or international medical graduate, physician specialty), and board certification were included in the models as covariates. We used studies in the literature to guide our inclusion of these covariates in regression models. 6 – 11 In a second set of regressions models, we performed a regression on each outcome (practice in a HPSA or MUA) after stratifying the sample into 2 separate specialty groupings, a primary care group and a non–primary care group, to explore possible interaction among race, ethnicity, and specialty groups broadly defined.
==================== COMPLETION 270 ====================
 The outcome variable for each specialty was the cumulative probability of working in a HPSA or MUA. The primary care group was defined as 1) practicing in a HPSA or MUA, 2) practicing in a non–primary care environment, and 3) practicing in both HPSA and MUA. We conducted a separate regression for each specialty group separately.

We contacted prospective members and current members of HPSA/MUAs seeking information about their practices. We also reached out to members of HPSA/MUAs with questions regarding community-based, professional, and patient care activities. The goal of the outreach was to learn more about the communities in which physicians practice. As part of this outreach, we asked members about their experience with community-based care services, including medicine, nursing, substance abuse treatment, and mental health services. We also asked members about their experience with medical school and residency recruitment, medical school admissions, and residency training. We obtained data by direct interview, telephone, e-mail, or letter. We used a structured questionnaire to collect demographic information, including race/ethnicity, practice location, and practice specialty. We asked members whether they were currently working in a HPSA or MUA, if they expected to work in a HPSA or MUA, and if they were currently in a HPSA or MUA.

We conducted a survey of 775 current members and 679 prospective members of HPSA/MAs, based in the United States and Canada, who are either practicing physicians or who are enrolled in medical school or residency programs. We obtained data from the 1973 National Health Interview Survey to identify physicians currently practicing in HPSA/MAs, and from the 2007–2008 National Health Interview Survey to identify physicians currently enrolled in medical school or residency programs in these areas. The surveys include questions about the type of practice (physician, group practice, or solo practice), specialty, and community or professional activities. We excluded physicians who were not practicing in a HPSA or MUA, because we were interested in the effects of these geographic areas on HPSA/MUAs.

In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed data on physician practice area size, HPSA/MUA practice characteristics, and demographic characteristics of HPSA/MUAs. We analyzed data on HPSA/MUAs' characteristics from the 1973 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to identify the characteristics of HPSA/MUAs and how they varied across HPSA/MUAs. 3 , 12 – 16 We also examined these characteristics from the 2007–2008 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS-R) because these surveys have greater validity over time. The NHIS-R samples are nationally representative of the US population. 17 The NHIS-R covers the period from 2007 to 2011. Data from the NHIS-R are collected from households with an individual in the household and include information on the frequency and type of health insurance coverage, work status, and demographic characteristics. 18 , 19

We examined disparities in physician practice size in the US and Canada by race/ethnicity, practice region, and specialty (primary care, non–primary care, and both primary care and non–primary care). We also examined disparities in physician practice size by specialty and practice region. To examine the effects of HPSA/MUAs on the representation of specific physician subspecialties, we stratified our analyses by specialty and examined the differences among HPSA/MUAs with respect to the representation of each specialty. We focused on minority physicians because minority physicians constitute a disproportionate share of patients in the US. 1 – 3 Minority physicians were defined as those who were members of a racial/ethnic minority. 3

 The final model included 3 variables; patient care hours, practice in an HPSA or MUA, and specialty group. We used both the final model and the regression models to examine whether physician race/ethnicity was a significant predictor of practice in a HPSA or MUA; we also conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to determine if the relationship was moderated by specialty group.

The American Medical Association has adopted a Code of Ethics 7 and a Code of Ethics for Physicians 7 that include provisions on physician race/ethnicity. 4 , 5 In 2011, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) adopted a Code of Ethics for Physicians in Osteopathic Schools that also incorporates provisions for physician race/ethnicity. 6 The AACOM Code of Ethics for Osteopathic Physicians is available online at: www.aacom.org/professional-code-of-ethics-for-physicians.

To determine whether the relationship between physician race/ethnicity and practice in a HPSA or MUA was moderated by specialty group, we created a series of regression models for each specialty group.

Using multiple logistic regression models, we determined the odds of working in a HPSA or MUA for physicians in different racial/ethnic groups relative to their white counterparts. Physician age, gender, patient care hours, place of medical school graduation (US or international medical graduate, physician specialty), and board certification were included in the models as covariates. We used studies in the literature to guide our inclusion of these covariates in regression models. 6 – 11 In a second set of regressions models, we performed a regression on each outcome (practice in a HPSA or MUA) after stratifying the sample into 2 separate specialty groupings, a primary care group and a non–primary care group, to explore possible interaction among race, ethnicity, and specialty groups broadly defined.
==================== COMPLETION 272 ====================
 The ethnicity variable was coded as 1 if the patient was a white person; 0 if the patient was a black person; or a mixture of white and black. The specialty groupings were coded as 1 if the patient was an international medical graduate (IMG) or a US resident; 0 if the patient was a physician in a primary care specialty; and 0 if the patient was a physician in a non–primary care specialty.

A specific set of questions was used to identify physicians who provided care to black patients, who were in minority groups, or who did not identify themselves as black. These questions were developed by using a transtheoretical approach to the data and were developed with an intent to identify racial/ethnic disparities. 12 We also asked physicians about their work hours and practice location within their HPSA or MUA. Physicians who responded that they provided care to black patients and who were located in an HPSA or MUA (n = 75) were defined as black physicians. Physicians who reported hours worked within their HPSA or MUA (n = 71) were defined as minority physicians. Physicians who reported work hours outside of their HPSA or MUA as their practice location (n = 73) were defined as non–minority physicians. Because of the complexity of the analysis, we excluded 2 physicians who provided care to both black patients and non–black patients (one in the primary care group and the other in the non–primary care group) because we had insufficient data for an analysis of racial/ethnic disparities.

Respondents were asked to report their geographic location as a practice location within a HPSA or MUA. Physicians residing within a HPSA or MUA were defined as practicing in a HPSA or MUA, respectively. Within a HPSA or MUA, a physician's practice location was categorized as a primary care practice, a subspecialty practice, an outpatient clinic, or a hospital.

To include all physicians who provided care to either black or white patients within their HPSA or MUA, we used data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to identify physicians. MEPS is a continuous survey of U.S. physicians conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The survey collects information on specific types of services delivered by HPSA or MUA physicians, including physician specialty, physician age, specialty location, and patient care hours. 2 The medical costs of patients treated by each physician were included in the survey, and the average amount of a particular service provided by each physician was calculated. MEPS data were used to identify physicians who provided care to either black or white patients in their HPSA or MUA.

Our analysis was restricted to physicians who were full-time and resident physicians who were practicing in an HPSA or MUA in 2007. We defined a physician as full-time if they had at least 30 hours of work per week during the interview period. Resident physicians were defined as practicing full time if they had at least 30 hours of work per week during the interview period.

This study was conducted as a retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a representative sample of all hospital-based U.S. inpatient patients (excluding emergency department patients and adolescents in group homes). The NIS includes information on patient characteristics and care delivered by HPSA and MUA physicians. The NIS is conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and includes a two-stage, clustered design. 12 The first stage surveys a list of all hospitals in the United States. The second stage interviews every inpatient in those hospitals, and the data are then used to compute a detailed profile of inpatient

Now, thanks to a new study conducted by the Institute for Strategic Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences, it is possible to explore the world of Russian intelligence's "new" agents.

The study was conducted by the Institute's Research Department, headed by Igor Sutyagin, a former Russian intelligence officer who has written two books on "new" agents, including one on the country's intelligence services' use of prostitutes.

The study was based on a survey of experts at the Russian Academy's Institute of Public Diplomacy and Communications, conducted in 2015 and 2016. Among them were representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the FSB, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).

We previously reported that DES significantly decreases the numbers of cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus of pregnant rats. We have now analyzed the effects of DES on the prenatally and postnatally acquired DG in mice, and we have found that DES treatment significantly decreases the number of cells in the DG of the offspring and of the mother.

DES exposure leads to structural and functional abnormalities in the hippocampus

Although DES exposure has been shown to cause numerous adverse effects on the reproductive system, including decreased fertility, increased risk for miscarriage and birth defects, it has not been clear whether DES alters the normal development of the brain. This question can be addressed by the evaluation of the effects of DES exposure in the prenatally and postnatally acquired hippocampal structure in mice. We have previously shown that DES exposure during pregnancy leads to structural and functional abnormalities in the hippocampus. In this study we analyzed the effects of DES exposure during pregnancy and the postnatal period on the DG of the offspring and the mother.

We have previously reported that DES treatment during pregnancy leads to a significant decrease in the numbers of hippocampal DG granule cells, which can be corrected by local administration of recombinant human DG-derived neurotrophic factor (rGDNF). However, we have also found that the number of granule cells in the DG is not restored after the adult period, and that the granule cell number is significantly reduced in the DG of the offspring and of the mother after DES exposure during pregnancy. The reduced number of DG granule cells was accompanied by increased cell death of DG granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) and by a reduction in the number of synapses in the granule cell layer of the DG. These results suggest that the postnatal hippocampal developmental programming is affected by DES exposure.

Furthermore, we have investigated the effects of DES on the offspring and the mother's behavior by using the object recognition task which is a well-established behavioral test of learning and memory. In this experiment we exposed dams to DES during gestation and we found that both dams and their fetuses had impaired object recognition memory following DES exposure in utero. After DES exposure in the postnatal period, both dams and their fetuses had normal object recognition memory. These results suggest that the effects of DES exposure in utero and postnatally on the hippocampal development and function are due to the effects of DES on the postnatal DG.

In animals exposed to DES during pregnancy, the newborn had signs of deficits in the object recognition task. These deficits were completely reversed upon postnatal exposure to DES and were completely absent in the offspring. Therefore, the effects of DES exposure on the normal development of the hippocampus and behavior of the offspring in utero and in the postnatal period suggest that DES has a serious impact on the normal development of the brain and that DES exposure during pregnancy and the postnatal period has a profound effect on the hippocampal development and function.

Above: full tilt range shown. Click for larger versions The tilt function of the screen is good as you can see from the above images. At the full 100mm height the screen provides a very good range of angles from a comfortable horizontal position. The sides are a little stiff though and it could be a little better. The bottom of the screen is curved and is a little weaker due to the curvature. Side to side swivel is also available on this model.

Above: full height tilt range shown. Click for larger versions The tilt function is very good overall. You can tilt the screen up to 120º from the center of the screen which is a little more than what you can do when using a monitor with a 100mm height. This is still not as much as some other larger screens but still good. The bottom of the screen is curved to a greater degree than the sides so it is a little stiffer than some other screens we've tested.

Above: full full tilt range shown. Click for larger versions The swivel function is also available, as shown above, but it is a little slower than the tilt function and doesn't provide quite as many adjustments.


Above: side to side swivel adjustment shown. Click for larger versions The tilt function and swivel function are good and are easy to use. The screen is very stiff as you can see from the images above, and it is a little stiffer than a lot of other WQHD screens. It's not so bad that you'll struggle to use it, but it is very stiff. The stand does rotate backwards on the back of the screen which is a nice touch. There is a nice cable tidy clip on the back of the stand as well.

Scarborough, who was not on the show, asked Trump if he would support U.S. airstrikes against the group, a direct defense of remarks he made in a speech on Tuesday. Trump said the United States should take the fight to the militants, and repeated his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.

"I think we should go in and take care of ISIS," Trump said. "ISIS is evil and bad and should be eradicated."

Trump has also called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States and for surveillance of mosques.

Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

The man was charged with inducing panic and making terroristic threats.

A witness told a local newspaper that Betts had a drinking problem.

The suspect's parents told Fox 2 that he was upset over Black Friday sales at a local Walmart.

"I don't want to see no police," Betts said. "They have to go. I'm gonna kill 'em all."

"They already know what's gonna happen," his father said. "They don't need to make this worse."

The newspaper said Betts posted a photo of himself in a black hat on Facebook, along with the caption "I've got a gun and I'm gonna shoot."

THE world's largest biological database is home to up to 1.2 million species – and that number is growing. The database, known as the Berkeley Genome Database, is being built by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The project is building on the database that the Human Genome Project created in 2003.

The Berkeley team is starting with a much larger collection than previous efforts, which covered just 36,000 genes. But the new collection will be able to accommodate 83,000 genes, which is expected to grow to more than 380,000 when all the genomes are included.

"It's a big change. I wouldn't say we've got everything, but it's a very good start," says George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who is the database's project leader. The Berkeley team has already begun to test the capabilities of the new database. "We're starting to look at disorders, to see whether we can identify different versions of the same gene and then see what the impact is on somebody," Church says.

==================== COMPLETION 289 ====================
.

Roughly speaking, policy gradients are a way to control the likelihood of a given policy given that an action is taken. Policy gradients can be thought of as deciding which of a set of possible actions a user is likely to take on a particular policy space (using a gradient). For example, given a policy space with two actions, our policy might be to move towards the first action. If we were to do so, we would be more likely to move towards the first action than towards the second action.

More generally, policy gradients are a way of controlling the likelihood of possible actions given a set of data: for example, given a set of actions, the policy gradient could act like a sort of probabilistic system. (See the Wikipedia article on Policy Gradients for more information).

In our case, we are using our policy gradient to learn the probability of taking the given action - the policy gradient is used in order to predict the probability of the given action taken. So our policy gradient is the probability, for a given action, of taking the action. If we were to run all possible actions on a policy space of actions and their probabilities, we would end up with a huge number of parameters which are essentially random. In fact, taking actions that are already on a policy space has no effect on the policy gradient, it just gives you some sort of prediction of the probability of the next action in the space.

For example, if we were to run all possible actions on a policy space of actions and their probabilities, we would end up with a huge number of parameters which are essentially random.

Now, what if instead of randomly choosing actions, we are learning a policy? Then we would want to know the probability of the given action being taken - the action filter. This means that the action gradient is actually a way of determining the probability of the action being taken by the policy and then using this probability to learn the action filter. In other words, what we are doing is learning a filter: the probability of an action is a function of the action filter.

For example, if we were to run all possible actions on a policy space of actions and their probabilities, we would end up with a huge number of parameters which are essentially random.

Now, there's a lot more to it than that. There are a lot of different ways we can learn the policy filter, and many different ways in which we can model the data that we have. If we think about the policy gradient as a sort of learning algorithm which is "learning", rather than "learning" the action, there's a lot more to it than that.

In fact, there's a pretty common misconception that policy gradients are just a way of learning a function which reduces to the action. That is incorrect; it is not a function of the action, it is a function of the policy. The fact that it is a function of the policy means that it has a lot of interesting properties which are worth explaining.

For example, suppose we have a model. For our example we are going to use a single pixel, a square, with a color of (0, 0, 0) in the range [0, 255]. The model is the probability density function: the probability of a pixel being in the square at (x, y) given the state is given by the following formula:

We now have a model in which the pixel is assumed to be a random variable, and we need to make a decision about its color. How do we predict what color it will be? We have a few options. For example, we can use a simple gaussian distribution to predict the color of the pixel. But here's the problem

If you're from outside of RL you might be curious why I'm not presenting DQN instead, which is an alternative and better-known RL algorithm
==================== COMPLETION 290 ====================
 - and why is policy gradient the best choice for us?

First, let's say we have an RL problem that is simple enough for us to actually implement, and we also want to solve it using a simple, but efficient, RL algorithm. It turns out that the simplest solution is to start with an easy problem and to add a policy gradient to it - we'll call it policy . The policy gradient is simply the cost of the action a player takes given a goal state - it's the cost to take an action given a given goal state (or set of goals) and a probability that we succeed, weighted by how likely it is that we succeed.

Now we know how to implement the RL algorithm, we can start implementing policy gradients. We will need a function that takes a policy and a goal state , and returns the policy gradient of some function of the two. It's an easy enough function:

class PolicyGradient: def __init__(self, self, goal): self.goal = goal self.policy = policy self.cost = get_polynomial_cost(goal)

The first line of assignment defines the class, the second line returns the policy gradient function, and the last line returns the value of the cost function.

This means we can code policy gradients like this:

class Player(object): def __init__(self, polygon): self.polygon = polygon def get_polynomial_cost(goal): return max(0,lambda x,y: x) - min(1,lambda x,y: y) class Classical(object): def __init__(self, goal, polygon): self.goal = goal self.polygon = polygon def get_polynomial_cost(goal): return max(0,lambda x,y: x) - min(1,lambda x,y: y) class Rat(object): def __init__(self, goal, polygon): self.goal = goal self.polygon = polygon def get_polynomial_cost(goal): return max(0,lambda x,y: x) - min(1,lambda x,y: y) class Drug(object): def __init__(self, goal, polygon): self.goal = goal self.polygon = polygon def get_polynomial_cost(goal): return max(0,lambda x,y: x) - min(1,lambda x,y: y)

Now we can try out our policy gradients! Here's an example:

class Game(object): def __init__(self, player, visible_player, hidden_player, direction, polygon): self.player = player self.visible_player = visible_player self.hidden_player = hidden_player self.polygon = polygon self.direction = direction def run(self): state = Player() player_state = Player(state, Player_Right, hidden_player, direction) hidden_state = Player(state, Player_Left, visible_player, direction) for i in range(10): state = Player(state, Player_Left, hidden_state, direction) hidden_state = Player(state, Player_Right, visible_state, direction) state = Player(state, Player_Left, hidden_state, direction) state = Player(state, Player_Right, player_state, direction) state = Player(state, Player_Left, player_state, direction) state = Player(state, Player_Right, hidden_state, direction)

==================== COMPLETION 291 ====================
. The reason for this is that the two algorithms are fundamentally different, which is why I'm not calling them DQN and Policy Gradient.

Policy Gradients in DQN

The simplest case of a policy gradient is a simple regression problem like:

where is a function of two parameters , the input and output variables.

This problem is easy to evaluate and solve. Let's say we have a function and x , and we want to predict the value of the function on the following training set , that is, we want to predict the updated value of . For this problem we want to maximize the posterior expectation of .

So let's write down the policy gradient of this problem, with the policy probabilities as the parameters and the weights as :

In the above example the complexity of the problem is , but as we'll see later we can get very similar results with much simpler models and algorithms.

Let's throw in a few more parameters and give the algorithm a little help:

Here we're using the lasso algorithm, which is a well-known function of a vector of features, which is a very common kind of model. So we're taking a vector of features and predicting the values of the features corresponding to those values. Our model is a vector of features and we're taking a vector of features and predicting the values of the features corresponding to those values.

The lasso is a very simple algorithm, but it's also not very effective in practice, since it's not very sensitive to the shape of the features (in particular, the shape of the image) and it doesn't take into account whether the features are sparse or dense. So it's not a good choice for a sparse image, which is common in many real-world situations. As such it's not a good choice for a lot of problems. For example, it's not very good for image segmentation.

Another common choice for policy gradients is a version of a common SGD algorithm called SGDPL, which replaces the lasso with a Gaussian process and uses the gradient information to guide the gradient. This is a very good choice for many problems, particularly when the feature space is sparse, because it learns to predict the values of features at a better rate.

There are some problems where we really want an SGDPL-like algorithm, for example when it's time to train an architecture that we already have on hand, for example when we want to perform a feature extraction or a feature selection.

However, SGDPL is not very good at predicting the values of features at a better rate than the lasso, so it's not a good choice for many other problems, too. In particular, it is not a good choice for sparse feature vectors.

PG is a standard class of policy gradients. It's a gradient descent algorithm that uses an optimization problem called a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to find the policy gradients, and it is a pretty standard class of policy gradients.

So what are the properties of PG? Well, it's a pretty simple algorithm that can be thought of as a variant of the SGDPL, with some additional parameters.

The main difference is that PG is very good at predicting the values of features at a better rate than the lasso. That means it can predict even very sparse features such as the pixel values. This is because it is able to use the gradient information gained from the MCTS to guide the gradient, which means it can learn to predict the values of features at a better rate than the lasso.

PG is a vector of features and weights, where the features are vectors of pixel values and the weights

 policy gradients with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) - these are also standard components. Of course, it takes a lot of skill and patience to get it to work, and multiple clever tweaks on top of old algorithms have been developed, but to a first-order approximation the main driver of recent progress is not the algorithms but (similar to Computer Vision) compute/data/infrastructure.

Now back to RL. Whenever there is a disconnect between how magical something seems and how simple it is under the hood I get all antsy and really want to write a blog post. In this case I've seen many people who can't believe that we can automatically learn to play most ATARI games at human level, with one algorithm, from pixels, and from scratch - and it is amazing, and I've been there myself! But at the core the approach we use is also really quite profoundly dumb (though I understand it's easy to make such claims in retrospect). Anyway, I'd like to walk you through Policy Gradients (PG), our favorite default choice for attacking RL problems at the moment. If you're from outside of RL you might be curious why I'm not presenting DQN instead, which is an alternative and better-known RL algorithm
==================== COMPLETION 292 ====================
.

Here's another way to think about PG for a moment: Imagine you want to train a neural network to play Atari games. In the standard approach you'd try to use more and more GPUs to do this. You would spend a lot of money on hardware, and you'd have a lot of data and data-structures to debug. Which obviously is a little bit stupid, and not very practical.

But a much better approach is to instead use a policy gradient algorithm, like Policy Gradient Search (PG) or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

PG is a simple implementation of a policy gradient algorithm, that is trained using a policy. Every iteration of the policy gradient algorithm, it will try to find for each time step the minimum of the gradient, and update the weights where needed, to minimize this gradient. This allows us to avoid having to worry too much about measuring gradients (though we do measure it). And it also lets us use a single algorithm for training and testing different policy gradients.

PG is also frequently used in the context of reinforcement learning. In reinforcement learning, a policy is a function that takes a reward and a loss to produce a cost (or a measure of how good the policy is). As we explained previously, PG allows us to compare policy gradients in a much more simple way, than you can with DQN, and it is often very cheap to train policy gradients. But it is also often quite slow and requires a lot of data.

Here is an example of a policy gradient with a game from Atari 2600. It is trained by 3 policy gradients, and after a few iterations the policy gradient among the 3 policy gradients is 0.94.

So what are the cool things about policy gradients?

First, they are cheap. If you train a policy gradient on a large amount of data, like our Atari games dataset, it will be much cheaper than using DQN on each game, and much faster than using Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Second, they are easy to train. This is the main reason we use policy here. Any solution that learns to play Atari games will be a policy, even if you tried to train it on a huge amount of data. This is the central property of policy gradients.

Third, they are very flexible. If you find yourself using a single policy to learn a lot of different games, it's easy to tweak that policy on the fly to learn something else. This is the interesting property of policy gradients. You can use policy gradients to learn the cost function for any particular game or policy. This is an important property to have in the context of RL. If you could train policy gradients to learn the cost function then you could be much more flexible about which games you want to learn from.

Fourth, policy gradients are also quite powerful. They have a lot of interesting properties that we have only just started exploring.

Fifth, they are extremely flexible. It will be pretty easy to write policies for many other games and applications than Atari 2600. We have already written policies for a lot of different games and applications, and have published many of them. These policies are written in a very straightforward way. It's basically just a matter of having a function that calculates a cost function for a given game and the associated policy gradient.

Finally, policy gradients are surprisingly general and flexible. To learn an Atari game is easy, but if you want to learn the cost function for a game that is different from Atari 2600 (like CS, Go, Go Fish, StarCraft, Pong, Poker, etc.) you'll probably need to write a lot of different policies, and have different

A study by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) found that India's rate of technology transfer was among the worst in the developing world.

The report, released on Tuesday, looked at four indicators, including the amount of patents applied for and granted, the number of applications filed and accepted, and the number of foreign ventures launched in India.

"It is evident from the data that India needs to get its act together in order to make the most of its potential in addressing the challenges of its growing economy and modernising its economy," the report's author, Jai Narayanan, said at a conference in Delhi.

Naval Ravikant, the founder of venture capital firm AngelList, said that the report showed that India still has a long way to go on transferring technology.

"India needs to focus on its infrastructure and the good quality of life that it provides to its people, and its technology leadership is a massive challenge for the country," he said.

The report showed that India's rate of patents per capita was below that of the other countries studied.

For instance, the United States had a patent rate of 69.4 per million population, while Japan had 38.3 per million population.

India had 70.5 patents per million population.

"The report also shows that there is a big gap in the rates of patent applications and patents granted in India," said J.P. Gopinathan, retired director general of WIPO, who was also present at the conference.

The report also found that India's rate of patent applications was less than those of countries like Germany (6.1) and Canada (2.8).

"This is a big challenge for India. It is a huge challenge to make sure that these kinds of records are maintained," said Narayanan.

The index also looked at the number of international venture capital (VC) deals that were launched in India.

"India has a long way to go in terms of the flow of venture capital. Traditionally, India has been regarded as having a very weak ecosystem for the promotion of VCs," said Gopinathan.

The report showed that of the total VC investments in the country, the top five investments were all in physical capital with the top three being in pharmaceuticals, utilities, and financial services.

The index also looked at the number of foreign investments that were launched in India.

"With the growth of the services sector, the number of foreign investments in the services sector has increased," said Gopinathan.

The report showed that the top three foreign investments in India were in information technology (18.4%), pharmaceuticals (10.6%) and financial services (8.4%).

"It is a big challenge for India to be able to manage these investments," he added.

City are coming up against a team that, on Wednesday, put a cap on their Premier League title challenge by beating Arsenal 4-0 in the Emirates. "I think we've got a few new players in and they have to find their feet," said Kompany. "It's certainly our first game without a lot of experience, but we are young and we can learn a lot from this game and the team is going to respond well.

"We have to be more focused than we have been in the past," added the City captain. "We are not a team that is going to play for 90 minutes for 90 minutes, for 90 minutes against a team that is in the title race. That's how we have to approach it.

"We have to be ready. We have to be more decisive than we have been. We know we have to be better, we know we have to be more aggressive. We have to go there, win the game and take the points. If we do that we are in the title race. We have to take it game by game, week by week and that's the way we want to go."

A win would see City move up to fifth, but victory would also see them remain sixth and, of course, there is the added complication of a Champions League tie against Barcelona.

"We have the Champions League," said Kompany. "We have to focus on ourselves. We know it's a big game. We have to go there and put in a good performance. We know that the players have been working at their best and we will need it against Barcelona.

"It's great to be able to play in Europe, it's great to be able to play each week, but we know we have to focus on ourselves. We have been working this week on our individual game. I can't really tell you how it's going to pan out, but we have to give it everything we have got.

"We will play it by ear and we will see how it goes. The team is doing really well and is doing everything we can. We just have to go there and win."

It's easy to understand why, considering the company recently launched their Steam Machines and Steam Machines are quickly becoming the best gaming platform on the planet.

All Valve has to do is make the PC gaming platform better. All Steam has to do is improve. It's a simple equation.

But that's not what Valve has done. Valve has not improved the PC gaming experience. In fact, they've done the opposite.

In fact, Valve has made the PC gaming experience worse.

In 2015, the company released a slew of mediocre games that were designed to make the PC gaming experience worse.

The Department of Justice has long maintained that law enforcement officers are allowed to shoot to kill, and when it comes to domestic violence, they're not wrong. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1,036 people were killed by police in the United States last year. That's nearly twice as many as were killed by the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

But that doesn't mean police are allowed to shoot to kill, or that all police officers believe it is okay to shoot to kill. It's not. It's not even close.

In fact, it's not even close to close. And so, as the recent police shooting of Walter Scott in South Carolina shows, the police are not just shooting to kill. They're shooting to wound, as well.

That said, there are a few things that shouldn't be ignored when it comes to the South Carolina shooting.

First of all, the fatal police shooting of Walter Scott was not an isolated incident. It isn't even the only fatal police shooting in South Carolina this year.

The month before Walter Scott was shot, the police killed 19-year-old Michael Jones. They say he was armed with a gun. They say he had a knife. They say he did not obey commands and did not drop the knife.

After the shooting, police say Michael Jones was screaming, "Don't shoot me, I have nothing to do with no gun." He was reportedly still holding a knife.

In the aftermath of the shooting, the police say Michael Jones had refused to comply with officers' commands and was combative.

Man against police. Man armed with a gun. Man resisting.

That's what the police are trained to do.

What they're not trained to do is to shoot to kill. If they're trained to shoot to kill, they're trained to shoot to wound.

The police have every reason to believe that Michael Jones was armed with a gun.

Aside from the fact that the police shot and killed Michael Jones, police have a video of him being shot. They say he was armed with a gun. The police say he would not drop the gun. They say he was combative.

The police don't even have the video to prove that Michael Jones was armed with a gun. They only have a video of the police shooting him.

And now, police say Michael Jones was armed with a knife.

And they're not wrong.

The police say that Michael Jones was armed with a knife, but video shows exactly the opposite.

According to a video from the Fullerton Police Department, Michael Jones is not seen in the video being armed with anything.

Instead, police say he was carrying a knife.

We are going to try to understand what happened and to do our best for the game. We have to be focused on our game, stay focused, stay calm, and try to solve the problem as quickly as possible."

He added: "It is a team that is very strong. How much stronger? They are stronger than us, but we will try to do the best for the next game. We have to be ready for the game and we have to do our best for the next game."

Pellegrini admits City's defensive issues are a concern. "Our defending needs to improve," he said. "I'm not sure if this is considered an issue. We have to do more. We have to work on some things. I understand that it's a very big game for us. We have to try to focus on the game. We have to concentrate on our game.

"We have to be more aggressive. We have to try to find a solution for the problems and try to improve. For example, in the second half, we are able to score two goals, so maybe it's one problem and another problem. We have to work on it and try to find the solution."

Pellegrini refused to give any indication of his starting XI, although he did note the absence of Vincent Kompany, who is a doubt with a hamstring injury.

He said: "Kompany is out. We have to look for another centre-back. We have to look at all the players that can play in the centre of the pitch. We have to look at how all the players are fit and available. We have to look at the competition in the squad.

Arsène Wenger is unlikely to rest any of his best players, although Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain could be recalled to the starting line-up after recovering from a groin injury.

Arsenal's defence has been plagued by injuries in recent weeks, with Laurent Koscielny, Per Mertesacker and Gabriel Paulista all missing long spells, with the three players now all out of action.

It's a position that requires a player to be constantly aware of his position in relation to his teammates. In short, it's a type of skill set that Evans is uniquely suited to fit into.

As a team, the Sounders truly excelled last season as a team built around rapid transitions. The secondary component to their success was their ability in possession. What that cost them was structure in transition play. With Gonzalo Pineda being an integral piece of the attack as he pushed from deep midfield forward and Marco Pappa dived inside as an inverted winger, the Sounders left huge swaths of open space in midfield that teams fast on the counter like New England and LA exploited to devastating effect over the course of the season.

While the Sounders eventually found a recipe to the problems caused by counterattacking and high press sides, it was less than ideal, requiring DeAndre Yedlin and Osvaldo Alonso to play in much more restrained roles. With a libero-style defender pushing up into midfield, this restricts the available space in opposition counter-attacks, allowing players Alonso the time to read, set up, and

 run. It also puts pressure on his defenders to have the ability to win the ball back quickly when they have it, when in reality it should be the other way around.

A place to start is in the last game of the regular season against LA in a playoff match. The Sounders were dominating possession and pushed up into midfield, with Alonso stepping up to the challenge of being a libero. Alonso's job was to be able to read the play, be able to set up teammates and pass to them effectively, and be able to make quick runs into space to defend against counterattacks. This is a perfect example of a player who can be really good in these roles, but has been limited in the past.

The Galaxy pressed Alonso into a difficult task. He was first asked to make a difficult run to win the ball back, while also being asked to deal with pressure from the Galaxy's center backs. Alonso was able to make it work, but it's a job that he has never had to perform in his MLS career.

Again, Alonso has a lot to learn about the position. In this second example, you see Alonso make a nice cutback while Alonso's man slants back to cover. Alonso has a lane to cut into, but his man is forced to reduce his angle to make the run, leaving Alonso open to a shot.

This is where Alonso is at his best. He is quick to read the play, has a lot of time to make the correct decision, and is able to make good decisions with the ball. He also has the ability to pass the ball on quickly, score a goal, and create space. This is something that he has struggled with throughout his career, and it is really easy to see why.

In the second example, Alonso is moving up to receive the ball with the outside of his foot, while the Galaxy's center backs are closing down on him in the middle. Alonso is able to hold his position, pick out a teammate, and then get the ball back quickly.

This is an example of Alonso being effective when he is able to keep his defensive focus on the opposition. He is able to read the play, make a decision, and then play off of that decision. He can do this because he has a lot of time to do so. Alonso has the ability to pick out linemates, but his main job is to get the ball back quickly, be able to get to the top of the box, and shoot.

This is Alonso's biggest flaw. In the previous example, Alonso had a good decision to make, but his attention was drawn away from the ball and to the pressure on him. In the second example, Alonso is caught in the middle of the field, and is unable to make the correct decision. His mind is on the pressure from his teammates, not on the ball.

Here, Alonso is in a good position in the midfield, but he is looking over his shoulder to see how the defense reacts to his movement. He is also a little too concerned about what his teammates will do. This is a problem that plagued him last season, and is something that has plagued him throughout his career.

In the second example, Alonso cuts back inside to receive the ball, but his teammate is forced to take a more narrow passing angle, leaving Alonso with no room to run into. Alonso didn't get the ball back quickly enough, and instead of playing it forward, he attempted to shoot from long distance.

There are a lot of ways that Alonso can improve his game. He has the ability to be a great defender for a team like Seattle, but he needs to be able to focus on the big picture and make smart decisions with the ball, instead of

 opposition presses by moving deep or pushing up into midfield alongside a defensive midfielder to provide structure, playmaking, and defensive stopping power.

==================== COMPLETION 298 ====================
 play a pass.

Evans can fill this role, but not without considerable risk. A player of his ability should be able to make his mark with a higher than average defensive rating, but he has a tendency to commit way too many fouls, and can be beaten by quicker, more technical attackers. This doesn't say Evans can't add value to the defense, but the options are limited without a defender of his caliber.

If Evans can maintain his composure, he can be a crucial component of the Seattle defense. His presence in midfield will improve the ability of the defense to play a high press, and his ability to win the ball back from the opposition will allow Seattle to play a high-press that relies less on speed and more on structure.

What's especially promising is that Chris Schuler has shown steady improvement playing in a more advanced role in the defense. Schuler has always been a solid defender, but he has been relatively inconsistent in his performances on the field, and his inconsistency is a major issue for Seattle. With Evans' playmaking ability and defensive ability in the midfield, Schuler will be able to contribute more to the team's attack and overall productivity.

The biggest question remains if Evans can be a productive, regular starter for the Sounders. His questionable discipline and propensity to commit fouls will always be a concern, but if he can minimize the issues caused by his fouls, then he could be a very valuable player for the Sounders.

My hope is that Evans is able to show enough in preseason to earn a starting central midfielder spot with the team. It's not only his ability on the field that will give Seattle the confidence to go on a long winning streak, it's his ability to contribute to the success of the team off the field as well.

"We have to look at the whole concept of the car and how it can serve the needs of the individual. A car should use the environment, not fight it."

Yves Robin, a member of the French-based motor sport group Palomar, is one of those who view the automobile as a tool for personal and social development. The French manufacturer's latest model, the BMW 7 Series, is the group's greenest model. It has a carbon fiber roof, a battery-free electric motor, and a new turbocharged engine, all designed to help reduce fuel consumption.

"BMW has always been ahead of the pack on environmental issues," says Robin. "It's part of the DNA of the brand."

The new 7 Series is also cheaper to manufacture than its predecessor. At US$173,766, the new model is about $4,000 less than its predecessor. The company says the price difference is due to the introduction of a new 2.0-liter turbocharged engine in the 7 Series and the adoption of a new manufacturing process to reduce the cost of plastics used in the model's interior.

A new 2.0-liter turbocharged engine was introduced in the BMW 7 Series in January of this year as part of a series of engine updates to the model.

"The new engine is more powerful and more efficient than the previous engine," says Naïve. "It's a big improvement. The new engine is a big step forward."

The new engine uses a new turbocharger that provides longer lasting power and more torque. The new engine generates more power with less fuel consumption than previous turbocharged engines, which can reduce emissions while improving fuel efficiency.

 attack.

If the Sounders are to continue to build their attack around rapid passing, they must find a balance between their people in the midfield and the players they deploy in attack.

The biggest knock on Evans was his inability to make the correct decisions in possession. While his last name and his position as a fullback would indicate that he possesses great passing ability, his decision-making was often poor. Evans often hesitated with the ball, often looking to make a quick pass instead of making the right decision with it. He will undoubtedly improve this in the coming years, but for now he's not quite ready to be a player that Carroll will call upon to make key passes for the offense.

These are not the only areas Evans must improve on, but they are the most glaring problems.

Evans' greatest strength is his positional sense, both in terms of his reading of the game and his ability to switch quickly between the center backs and holding midfield. The former is a crucial component of his game, as he can read the game and read the game well. As his name suggests, he's not afraid to take on opponents and break up play with his physicality. His quickness and physicality in the air are a major asset. Evans is often a one-on-one defender, and he's incredibly strong at defending in the air.

In terms of his skill on the ball, Evans has shown a knack of finding the right pass at the right time. His ability to read the game and make smart decisions is extremely important. He's shown flashes of this skill, but he occasionally makes the tough decision to play the ball when he doesn't have a player that is in the right position to receive the ball. He's shown flashes of this skill, but he occasionally makes the tough decision to play the ball when he doesn't have a player that is in the right position to receive the ball.

Evans' biggest weakness is in the final third. His passing can be slightly slow, and he does not have the vision to make accurate crosses from deep. He will need to improve his final-third passing if he is to succeed as a designated player for the Sounders.

The most obvious flaw in Evans' game is that he might not be able to make the transition smoothly from playing in a more defensive role to playing as a winger. His positioning in the center of the pitch will need to be better than it was last season.

How Evans fits in with the Sounders attack will be a big question for the 2017 season. If he can play in a deeper role with the ball on the ground, he will be able to drop deep and make creative runs in the final third. If he plays in a more advanced role, he will be able to drift inside and provide an outlet for the attack.

With the Sounders being a team that likes to press high up the field, Evans' position in the starting XI will be crucial in whether or not he is able to make the transition. It is unclear if Sigi Schmid has set up Evans for the style of play that is now being deployed by the Seattle attack. Schmid's positional sense is a huge asset, and he will need to make sure Evans is positioned correctly.

The Sounders will need to win their first two home games of the season to receive the best possible production from Evans and the rest of the

 opposition presses by moving deep or pushing up into midfield alongside a defensive midfielder to provide structure, playmaking, and defensive stopping power. It's a position that requires a player to be constantly aware of his position in relation to his teammates. In short, it's a type of skill set that Evans is uniquely suited to fit into.

As a team, the Sounders truly excelled last season as a team built around rapid transitions. The secondary component to their success was their ability in possession. What that cost them was structure in transition play. With Gonzalo Pineda being an integral piece of the attack as he pushed from deep midfield forward and Marco Pappa dived inside as an inverted winger, the Sounders left huge swaths of open space in midfield that teams fast on the counter like New England and LA exploited to devastating effect over the course of the season.

With a libero-style defender pushing up into midfield, this restricts the available space in opposition counter-attacks, allowing players Alonso the time to read, set up, and
==================== COMPLETION 300 ====================
 play a high percentage ball. It also eventually limits the ability of Donovan Ricketts to get forward and support the attack, as Alonso drops in to a more advanced position to provide defensive support to his teammates.

As far as the midfield is concerned, the Sounders will have to be more creative in their play. With Pineda and Pappa playing as inverted wings, they are significantly more limited in their ability to serve as a conduit for wide passes. This compounding problem can be solved by Alvaro Fernandez and Jordan Morris serving as more dynamic runners than Alonso. When Arguably the most creative player in the league last season, Fernandez had his moments to shine as a forward, including some gorgeous assists. However, his creativity could be best served in more of a support role, especially as he pushes up to a more attacking role. While Morris' speed can be a valuable tool, he's best used as a playmaker, not a forward.

In response, Seattle will need to be more creative in their play. The midfield is a significant concern, but the team will need to play a more open style than it did last season. The Sounders will need to use their speed to disrupt the play in the midfield, but can also use their creativity to create more open space for their players to exploit. They will need to find a balance between providing a more direct style of play and utilizing more creative players to get to the final third.

While the team will need to move in a more direct way, the Sounders will also need to counterattack better and more effectively. That is where Alonso, Pineda, and Pappa will need to step up. Their ability to create chances in transition will be critical, as will their ability to keep their defense organized and at least somewhat compact. Once the Sounders manage to get through the midfield and start to penetrate the final third, they will need to be quicker and more aggressive in putting the ball in the right areas.

In order to do so, the Sounders will need to be more creative with their passing. Seattle's passing last season was poor, especially on the right side. Their inability to pass into space on the right side is apparent when looking at their shot maps, as the Sounders regularly struggled to find any space in front of the goal. They also struggled to create chances in the final third, and their long balls often ended up in the net instead.

Seattle will need to find a better balance with their passing. While they will likely need to improve their ability to pass into space, they should still be able to find some success with their passing in the final third. The fullbacks will need to be more disciplined in their positioning, as they are extremely susceptible to counters and are never going to have the same success with long balls into space that they had in the past.

With Alonso and Pineda moving to a more advanced position, the Sounders will need to double up in central midfield. This will allow the forwards more room to operate in the final third. While the Sounders will need to cut down on the number of long balls into space, they will need to be more creative with their long passes and find space for Pineda and Pappa to operate in.

The Sounders will need to play a more direct style of play, but they will need to do so with the support of a more creative midfield. While the Sounders will likely have to sacrifice some of their speed and creativity, they will still need to find a way to stay organized and to get into the final third.

The Sounders will need to find a balance between their direct style and their more creative style. They will need to find a way to find more space in the final third, but not lose the ability to create chances or

Previously, Moreno was the mayor of Ciudad Juarez for two terms. Facing an indictment on charges of drug trafficking and bribery, Moreno's release was negotiated with the U.S. Attorney. He was released on bond after agreeing to not violate his probation.

U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas John R. Parker announced today that Moreno has been arrested and is charged with one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, and one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

According to the indictment, from between December 2012 and January 2013, Moreno and his co-conspirators conspired to buy and sell cocaine from cocaine traffickers and to transport cocaine into and out of the United States. Moreno agreed to receive a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of cocaine, and would receive $300,000 after the sale. The indictment also alleges that Moreno and his co-conspirators would pay bribes to Mexican government officials, including police and prosecutors, in exchange for protection from arrest.

According to Parker, Moreno's arrest was the culmination of an 18-month investigation into organized crime in Ciudad Juarez.

I've been doing this because I've been realizing that I was using the wrong tools to help me make better choices.

When you're feeling unhappy and stuck, it's easy to blame things like food, exercise, and stress. But we all have these things in our lives. We're all going through them. And I think we can do a better job of being realistic about what's going on.

The big secret for living happier is to realize that the choices we make are made for us. We don't have to force the world to do what we want. We can let it do what it wants. It's about letting go of the need to control everything in our lives and letting things happen just for us.

When we take the time to let ourselves do what we want, we better be OK with the results. If we're not, we're missing out on something that is going to make us happy.

Here are a few things I've had the best results with:

==================== COMPLETION 304 ====================
 were very upset when we were told to go back, to the Hillel House, and that the police would remain outside overnight. I told them that it was over for them. I said that even though the police had been there all day, that we didn't have to be afraid.


The next day, I received a letter from the Hillel President, thanking me for not participating in the violence. I thanked him for his concern, but then I said, "Why didn't you tell us to go to the police?" Then, he was silent. I said, "I guess he was afraid of the police." He said, "Well, it was a good thing he was afraid."


I was deeply disturbed and saddened by what I saw at UC Berkeley. It was the first time that I had been close to being a victim of police violence. I got involved with the civil rights movement in the late '60s, as an organizer and student leader. I was involved in the March on Washington, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. I was part of the student movement that fought for the eight-hour work day. I was involved in organizing and was a participant in the 1965 and '66 Watts riots. In 1965, I was part of the Freedom Rides. I marched on Washington with Martin Luther King and supported the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. I was involved in the movement to end school segregation.


I had seen the worst of police brutality, and I was sickened by what I had seen. I had been an organizer that led many confrontations with law enforcement in the '60s and '70s. I had been involved in the arrest of a police officer who had used a racial epithet and beaten a woman, who was pregnant at the time. I had been involved in the arrest of a police officer who had raped a woman and then threatened to kill her. I had been involved in the arrest of a police officer who had killed a child. I had been involved in the arrest of a police officer who had murdered a man.


So, I had seen the worst of police brutality, and I was even more concerned when I saw the police violence on the Berkeley campus. I was not surprised at all when I saw how the police reacted to the Palestinian students who were in a Palestinian solidarity demonstration. As I have seen many times in my life, police are trained not to be cooperative, and they are very aggressive when they are confronted by people who are trying to do the right thing. In fact, when a police officer confronts a person who is trying to do the right thing, the police officer is usually the aggressor.


It was not so much that the police officers brought the violence upon themselves. It was that they did not participate in the violence. They did not encourage it, they did not participate in it. They felt that they had to protect their students from the violence in order to preserve the reputation of the police department on their campus.


It was almost unbelievable to me that this was the same police department that had brought me to the hospital in 1969, after I was beaten and bloody and unconscious. It was almost unbelievable that they were the same police department that would be so callous and insensitive as to allow this violence to happen on their campus.


The police were protecting the white supremacist crowd, the white racists who were upset by the Palestinians who were protesting the death of a student in Israel. They were protecting the white racists who were upset that the Palestinian students were protesting injustice. The police were protecting the white racists who were upset that the Palestinian students were protesting violence.

A teenage boy has been shot dead in what police say was a deliberate attack on his home by a man who also tried to burn his body.

The boy, believed to be 15, was killed while sitting in his bedroom in the town of Torlakan, in the south-western province of Borneo, on Sunday night.

His body was found nearby with an AK-47 assault rifle and several additional shots.

Police said the man had been an alcoholic and had been angry at the boy's mother for leaving him.

"He was angry because his mother left him several years ago and she has never been back," said chief police officer Wez Heryawan.

"He had consumed alcohol and he was worried that the boy would be punished if he left his father."

However, the boy's father, a former policeman, denied his son was involved in drugs and said police had been "hounding him and his family" since his son's death.

"The police wanted to kill my son by burning his body," said the father, who does not want to be named.

"I want justice for my son."

'He was a good boy'

The incident happened in a village near Torlakan's main road.

Police have not yet released the name of the deceased but have said he was a resident of the area.

The high cost of using cloud computing coupled with the fact that most digital marketing budgets are still not indexed with cloud computing is one of the main reasons why many marketers are still struggling to integrate cloud computing into their marketing strategies.

Here are five of the most common reasons that marketers have been hesitant to use cloud computing:

1. Marketing budgets aren't indexed.

Marketers are often reluctant to use cloud computing because it's not indexed with their marketing budgets. This is because marketers are still not sure how their marketing budgets will be indexed with cloud computing.

For example, if a marketing budget was indexed with Amazon's S3 cloud storage, then any data that is added to that budget would be indexed with that budget.

2. No budget is indexed.

Marketers may feel that no budget or budget only indexed with cloud computing. This is because many marketers are still unsure how their marketing budgets can be indexed with cloud computing.

For example, if an agency had an advertising budget indexed with Amazon S3 cloud storage, the agency would have access to any new marketing campaigns created with that budget.

3. Marketing budgets are too big.

Some marketers are concerned that having their marketing budgets indexed with a cloud computing platform will mean that they will have to spend more money each month on marketing.

While this is true, the bigger question is whether or not the marketing budget should be indexed at all.

Given the high cost of using cloud computing, there is always the risk that it could cost a marketing agency more money to use cloud computing than the agency could afford.

4. Marketing budgets are too small.

Some marketers are worried that they will not be able to use cloud computing in their budgets.

This is because if a marketing budget is indexed then the marketing budget will always be indexed. This means that any marketing campaigns created with that budget will be indexed with that budget.

5. Marketing budgets are too small to move to the cloud.

Some marketers are worried that they may not have the budget to move their marketing budgets to the cloud.

This is because if a marketing budget is indexed then the marketing budget will always be indexed. This means that any marketing campaigns created with that budget will be indexed with that budget.

However, if a marketing agency can afford to pay for its cloud computing expenses, then the marketing budget will be indexed.

In fact, cloud computing is such an attractive investment for a marketing agency because they don't have to worry about whether or not their marketing budgets are indexed.

But he has been a more visible presence on the track this pre-season than any other in his time at the Suns and has taken part in the full-contact match simulation work over recent weeks.

He was not in a moon boot nor was there any hint of a limp as he walked around the boundary.

Eade said there was no cause for concern.

"He could have played and he could play next week but we are not going to,'' Eade said.

"He has a mild foot strain, which is a little bit grumbly at the moment, so we have off-loaded him today and he just did some work on the bike.

"But he has had such a great pre-season there is no point risking him. He wouldn't have played three NAB games anyway. He will be offloaded for a few days and will start running at the end of next week.''

Lynch, Prestia and Martin were rested after pulling up sore from a physical session on Monday.

Prestia was scheduled to play but woke on Saturday morning

 with a sore hamstring, and was replaced by Martin, who is expected to be sidelined for three weeks.

In the Suns' intra-club game against Adelaide, Lynch was injured when he was thrown to the turf by a defender during a marking contest.

Eade said Prestia was "smiling and looking very good" and was looking forward to playing in the Suns' next game.

"He is a bit sore and his hamstring has been sore for a while but he is just a little bit sore at the moment,'' Eade said.

"So we are hoping for a quick turnaround and he will be back in the Suns' side later in the week.

"It's a little bit sore and he has trained well all pre-season. So hopefully he will be playing in the next game.''

Lynch, who has been under intense scrutiny since injuring his knee against the Brisbane Lions in Round 23, is one of the Suns' key players.

He has played every game since his debut in Round 1, 2013 and averaged 21 disposals in 21 games.

But he has been plagued by knee injuries throughout his career and last year he played just four games.

Eade said he did not believe it was a setback.

"It's his hamstring we are concerned about," Eade said.

"He has a bit of soreness in his hamstring so we have offloaded him today and have him run on the bike with some other players.

"At the moment we are just taking it day by day.

"He will be offloaded next week and we will see how he goes but he will be back soon.

"At the moment we are not worried."<|endoftext|>Binary and hexadecimal - numeric data type

This page contains a quick introduction to the binary and hexadecimal data types.

The term binary is used as a prefix to some information that is to be stored in a number. For example, the number 0x1B is a binary number, which means it can be represented in two different ways:

0x1B - this is a signed integer: it is both a positive and a negative value.

- this is a signed integer: it is both a positive and a negative value. 0x00 - this is a unsigned integer, which means it is both a positive and a negative value.

The hexadecimal (hex) number is a sequence of zero or more hexadecimal digits. This sequence is always a decimal number and is stored using the sequence 0x0A , 0x0B ... 0x0C .

For example, the hexadecimal number 0x1B is stored as a sequence of 0x10 0x20 0x30 0x40 0x50 0x60 .

The sequence 0x1B can be either signed or unsigned. The latter corresponds to the IEEE-754 standard.

The number 0x1B is stored in hexadecimal form. In this instance, the hexadecimal value is always a decimal number.

Decimal numbers are stored using the sequence 0x0A , 0x0B ... 0x0D .

The sequence 0x1B is stored in binary form. Binary numbers are always a decimal number and are stored using the sequence 0x0A , 0x0B ... 0x0C .

The number 0x1B is stored in hexadecimal form. Hexadecimal values are always a decimal number and are stored using the sequence 0x0A , 0x0B ... 0x0D .

 with a fever and was taken straight to hospital for tests.

He has been diagnosed with a temperature of 41.6 but is expected to be ruled out for a week.

Martin was also taken to hospital for scans but is expected to be out for three weeks.

Callum Ah Chee will also miss the match and will resume training at the end of the month.

The Suns have also recalled Mayne from the rookie list and will turn to the 19-year-old as a replacement for Lynch.

He will play against Gold Coast on Saturday night, May 25, while Lynch's return will come later in the season.

It is the second time in three days the Suns have used a rookie in the backline — forward Mason Wood was used to great effect in the win over Greater Western Sydney on Saturday.

Wood's first-term effort was instrumental in the Suns' 14-point victory but he was withdrawn at half-time after getting in a slight scuffle with Patrick Dangerfield.

He has played just two senior games this season after being taken with pick 47 in the 2016 NAB AFL Draft.

The Suns have only three players on the extended injury list — Mitch Hallahan, Adam Saad and Alex Sexton.

Saad is a chance to miss two weeks after rolling his ankle in the VFL on Wednesday and is also a chance to miss one game on Saturday.

Saad had scans on his left ankle and is expected to miss two weeks.

Sexton is a chance to miss one week after tweaking the hamstring in his first game back from a knee reconstruction.

Jason Castagna, Jack Martin and Michael Rischitelli are also on track to return from injury.<|endoftext|>(CNN) In the wake of a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, this past weekend -- in which a woman was killed and dozens injured -- President Donald Trump has been criticized for not doing enough to condemn the hate groups.

Trump faced a heated backlash on Tuesday after he condemned "hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides" and did not specifically single out white supremacists for condemnation.

So what do historians say about the President's comments?

Related content Trump's comments on Charlottesville: What they mean

Trump's predecessor -- Barack Obama

In the aftermath of the Charlottesville violence, Obama said that "racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans."

The President, who put a stop to the controversial Keystone XL pipeline during his time in office, continued, "There are no good neo-Nazis, and those who espouse their views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms. They are evil."

Former President Barack Obama addresses the Unite the Right rally on August 12, 2017.

Obama also specifically condemned the KKK and neo-Nazi groups.

"The notion that there could be some kind of equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and KKK members and people who were protesting against them -- that is to deny reality," he said. "And to suggest that those who were demonstrating against the Nazis were as bad as the people who were marching in the KKK robes is as ridiculous as it is offensive."

In an interview on "This Week" the morning after the Charlottesville rally, Obama said, "The idea that we would try to make distinctions in and over a tragedy like this is naive."

"It's not like there's some simple equivalency here," Obama said. "I think there was an effort on the part of some people,

The collection of rubbish in Portugal is not made as it is in the U.K., and for this reason, it was necessary to take the rubbish to a tip (disposal area) which was called 'recycling area' near the back of the Ocean Club. I used the Renault Scenic for this reason on many occasions.

On one occasion, I believe it was on July of 2007, I took Patricia to the supermarket. We carried bags in the boot (trunk) of the Renault Scenic; bought various items including fresh fish, shrimp and beef. When we unloaded the shopping bags, we noticed that blood has run out of the bottom of the plastic bag. After this shopping trip and still in the month of July 2007, I began to notice a strange odour in the car. I did not give it much importance and assumed it was likely due to the leakage from the rubbish bags or from the blood which had escaped from the shopping bags. As a result, we removed the carpet from the boot (trunk) in order to clean it. I tossed (beat) the boot carpet to remove any particles and cleaned it with a wet cloth and

One night, I was at a local bar when a large truck stopped on the road which lead to the Ocean Club. I was at the bar when the police arrived on the scene. They were a group of officers from the Port Police Department who were there to assist with the search of the car. I had to be with them for a few minutes on the scene to help them locate the car.

They asked me where the car was parked. I told them that it was parked in a lot next to the Ocean Club. They asked where the car was located. I told them that the car was found in the parking lot next to Ocean Club. They asked me what the car was doing there. I told them that it was parked in the lot next to the Ocean Club. They asked me what was in the car. I told them that there was a shopping bag in the boot of the car. They told me to look inside the boot. When I opened the boot, I was shocked to see human blood. I was very shocked and I did not ask them any further questions.

I was given a copy of the police report in which the police stated that the blood was human blood. The report also stated that the blood was found in the boot of the car. I was extremely shocked by this report. I was able to confirm that the blood was human blood. I believe this blood was from my son.

I have no doubt that the blood was from my son. I believe that there is a very good chance that it was from my son. I have no doubt that the blood was from my son. I have no doubt that the blood was from my son.

I interviewed my son, who told me the following:

"On the night of the murders, I was driving home from work. I was asleep in the back seat of the car. I was driving north to the Ocean Club when I saw blood on the road. I slowed down and stopped the car. I walked to the side of the road, switched on the emergency lights and called 911. I was on the phone with 911 for about 45 minutes until the police arrived on the scene. I was able to identify the blood which was my son's blood.

I am positive that my son was murdered. I am positive that he was murdered. I am positive that he was murdered."

I asked my son about the blood on the road. He told me that it was blood. This was his version of events. It is my belief that he was trying to account for the blood on the road. This is why he was calling 911. At the time of the phone call, he was not aware that there was a police investigation.

In February of 2008, my son responded to a request for an interview. My son was a qualified fireman and he had been trained on how to handle a fire. He had been trained on how to resuscitate someone who had died in a fire. He had been trained on how to extract the victim's organs. He had been trained on how to extract the victim's organs.

On August 17th, I took Patricia to the Health Centre near the Ocean Club. I took her to the Emergency Department. The Staff doctor, Dr. Carvalho, was looking after Patricia's condition. He and another doctor were unable to determine the presence of any physical abnormalities in the patient during the examination. I had a blood test, which was negative for any infections. I also had a urine test which was negative. I also had an EKG which was negative. I took Patricia's blood pressure and heart rate and noted that the readings were normal.

On September 1st, my wife and I went to the Portuguese Embassy. During the visit, I noted that the Embassy's staff doctor was very positive about Patricia's well-being. He also stated that he did not believe that Patricia had been diagnosed with any disease. He also stated that he thought the problem was the result of the blood clot which had been present in her brain for some time and which had caused her to lose consciousness.

On September 5th, I took Patricia to the hospital to have the blood clot removed. I had a CT scan which was positive for the presence of a blood clot. I also had the results of her urine tests which were both positive. She received a prescription for Zantac.

On September 11th, I took Patricia to the Emergency Department at the Hospital. I took the radio to her and had her take a couple of just before bedtime doses of it. I took her to the Emergency Department for another CT scan which was negative for the presence of any blood clot. I also took her to the cardiac catheterization lab to have the blood pressure checked. The results were negative. I had her take Zantac for the night.

On September 15th, I took Patricia to the European Military Hospital in Inverness. I took her to the Emergency Department. The Emergency Doctor was very positive about her well-being. He did not believe that she had any physical abnormalities. He also stated that he did not think that the cause of her illness was the blood clot that had been present in her brain for some time. He also stated that he did not believe that the problem was due to the blood clot in her brain. He also noted that she had a platelet count that had been normal.

On September 16th, I took Patricia to the Emergency Department at the Hospital. The ambulance was sent to the Hospital for the treatment of her heart attack. When I returned to the car, Patricia was unconscious. I took her to the Emergency Department. I noted that she was not breathing and that her pulse was weak. I noted that the EKG was negative. I also noted that the blood pressure was high. I had her go into a DRUG NURSE. She was taken to the Emergency Department. After the treatment of the heart attack, the EKG was again low and that was the reason for the ECT. I had the EKG paged and the results were negative.

On September 22nd, we returned to Portugal. I took Patricia to the Hospital. I took her to the E.M.H. for a CT scan. The results were positive for the presence of a blood clot. I also took the blood pressure and pulse reading. The blood clot was removed. I had the CT scan paged and the results were negative. I had the EKG paged and the results were negative. I had the ECT paged and the results were negative.

I then checked the blood on the carpet and ground. It was dark red, blood-like and had a foul smell. On further inspection, I found that the carpet had blood smeared on it. I noticed that the blood was dark red and that it had an odd smell. I also noticed that the carpet was wet. I then removed the carpet and examined it. This is what I found: There was a small amount of blood smeared on the floor in front of the left front door handle. There was also a dark red (muddy) stain on the carpet under the seat. There was also a red (muddy) stain on the rear left tyre. There were also several bloody palm prints on the left front door handle. (There were no prints on the door handle, the front and rear door, and the rear right tyre). There were also several bloody palm prints on the rear right tyre.

==================== COMPLETION 312 ====================
 a hose. I used a vacuum cleaner to clean all the other components of the car. I then went to the back of the car and removed the rear seat cover, and found that there was a hole in the seat. I believe the hole was caused by one of the luggage bags which had been placed on top of the seat. After this, I began to clean the contents of the boot (trunk) using the vacuum cleaner. I also cleaned the car using a vacuum cleaner, and removed the carpet and the seat cover from the boot (trunk).

After cleaning the car, I noticed the smell of burnt plastic. It was a smell which I had not noticed before. I took the car to the mechanic and explained what had happened. He told me that the worst case scenario is that the fire was caused by the plastic bag which contained the blood. He told me that I should have removed the plastic bag from the boot (trunk) and that the fire had been caused by the plastic bag. He advised me that I should have tested the car in an airport to confirm the fact that the blood has not been burnt. He also advised me that if I knew that the car is not covered in blood, that I should have removed the plastic bag from the boot (trunk) as I do not want to cause any damage to the car.

I did not mention the burnt plastic to Patricia at the time. I assumed it would be a normal occurrence in a car which has been used for a long time and is not covered in blood. I checked and found that the car was covered in blood.

On September of 2007, I filled in a Police report which stated that the car was involved in a road traffic accident. I was advised to get a police report form from the police station and complete it. I did so and sent it to the police. I was not given the form to fill out at the police station as I was told that the form would not be sent out by the time that the report was received.

As I was on the phone with Patricia before I went to the police station, I was told that my car had been involved in an accident and that the police had suggested that I get a police report form. I then told Patricia that the police had advised that I should get a police report form and that I would do so. I then returned to the car to get the form.

I had asked the mechanic at the time whether he had noticed anything strange about the car in the month of July. He said that he had not noticed anything unusual in the car. We both agreed upon the fact that the car had been used for a long time and that it had not been used in the month of July.

When I returned to the police station, I was told that the police would not accept my report. The Police report states that the car was involved in an accident in which the driver had lost control of the car and hit a tree. The police report also states that the driver of the car was transported to the hospital for treatment of a broken leg. The police report states that the accident happened on July 15th 2007 in Santo António de Almagro, Portugal.

The police report states that while at the hospital, the driver of the car lost consciousness and became unresponsive. The police report states that the driver was then transported to the hospital and was in a vegetative state. The police report states that the driver was treated for a broken leg. The police report states that the car is covered in blood and that a child was in the car.

When I received the Police report form, I filled it in. I filled in the police report and told the police officer that I had taken the

 breathing evenly and regularly. This will help you relax. Some people find that it's easier to regulate their breathing if they count, or if they chant a simple tone, like "Om," as they inhale and exhale. The more often you do this, the easier it will become.

Once your breathing is regulated and even, it's time to begin visualizing energy. This may seem weird if you've never done it before. Rub the palms of your hands lightly together, as though you were trying to warm them, and then move them an inch or two apart. You should still feel a charge, a tingling sensation between your palms. That's energy. If you don't feel it at first, don't worry. Just try again. Eventually you'll start to notice that the space between your hands feels different. It's almost as though there's a bit of resistance pulsating there, if you gently bring them back together.

After you've mastered this, and can tell what energy actually feels like, you can start playing with it. This means you can focus on that area of resistance. Close your eyes, and feel it. Now, visualize that tingly area expanding and contracting, like a balloon. Some people believe you
==================== COMPLETION 313 ====================
 should visualize your energy expanding and contracting in every direction. This may not be possible at first, but it is an amazing way to start. It's an attempt to make energy everywhere.

Although the process of visualization is called the visualization of energy, it's actually any type of mental process you start to use to calm your mind. If you are feeling agitated, it is called the visualization of anger. If you are getting easily distracted and lose track of time, it is often called the visualization of desire. Visualization can be very powerful.

Once you've mastered the visualization of energy, move on to the visualization of objects. Try to visualize a butterfly, or even a very small white butterfly, suddenly appear from nowhere, and then fly off into the distance. You can also try to visualize the wind, or any other small, static form of energy. Keep looking for the butterfly, and it will appear right over your head.

In a previous article, I discussed the importance of visualization in adapting to life on the road. This time I want to focus on what you can do to use visualization to help you in your meditation practice.

One of the most important things you can do with visualization is to visualize yourself in the present moment. You may be able to do this by focusing on the breath or a small image. When you visualize yourself in the present moment, you are able to pay attention to what is happening right now. This is an important skill to master, because it allows you to stay in the present moment.

For example, imagine that you are sitting in a chair with your legs stretched. Imagine that you're looking down at yourself. Now imagine that you are standing up, and that you're walking down the road. It may seem like you are walking, but you're actually just looking down at yourself.

At this point, all of your attention is on the breath and your body. This is called focusing the mind. The more you can keep your attention on the breath, the better you will be able to meditate.

The next step is to imagine moving your body. Imagine that you are standing up and pulling the chair back to yourself, so you're standing over the chair. Now imagine that you're sitting down and pulling the chair back to yourself, so you're sitting over the chair.

This is the same technique as above, but you're now imagining moving the chair. It's a bit easier to get the chair moving. You can also imagine that you are the chair. Imagine that you're pulling the chair away from you.

You can use this technique to move your body, or to move your thought. The more you can get your attention focused on something, the better you'll be able to stay in the present moment and stay calm.

Most people usually get into a rhythm with their breathing in meditation, but the visualization technique is a little different. The visualization process is a lot like falling asleep. You can visualize everything you can think of, and your mind will flow freely. It can really help you relax.

One of the best ways to practice this technique is to visualize yourself during your meditation practice. Just imagine yourself in your meditation space. This is a very powerful technique. It's a lot like falling asleep, because your mind will be very active. But it's a lot more relaxing. When you meditate, you're just focusing on your breath. It's impossible to get distracted. When you think about anything, your mind automatically moves on to something else.

Trying to stay in the present moment is very important. You can use the visualization technique to help you stay in the present moment during your meditation. Just imagine yourself in your meditation space. Don't try

 breathing evenly and regularly. This will help you relax. Some people find that it's easier to regulate their breathing if they count, or if they chant a simple tone, like "Om," as they inhale and exhale. The more often you do this, the easier it will become.

Once your breathing is regulated and even, it's time to begin visualizing energy. This may seem weird if you've never done it before. Rub the palms of your hands lightly together, as though you were trying to warm them, and then move them an inch or two apart. You should still feel a charge, a tingling sensation between your palms. That's energy. If you don't feel it at first, don't worry. Just try again. Eventually you'll start to notice that the space between your hands feels different. It's almost as though there's a bit of resistance pulsating there, if you gently bring them back together.

After you've mastered this, and can tell what energy actually feels like, you can start playing with it. This means you can focus on that area of resistance. Close your eyes, and feel it. Now, visualize that tingly area expanding and contracting, like a balloon. Some people believe you
==================== COMPLETION 314 ====================
 can "push" that energy out of the area, if you concentrate long enough. For example, you might count out loud as you do this, or you can visualize it as you breathe. If you're not sure what to focus on, try focusing on anything that seems to be acting as a power source. If you're still not sure what to do, focus on the area around you.

After a while, you'll start to notice that the energy you're seeing around you is moving. This is how you know it's working. When you see this happening, feel the energy around you. You might feel it shoot upwards, or you might feel it move slightly downwards.

When you're feeling this energy moving around you, you can also feel that energy moving inside you. As you breathe, you can feel your energy moving in and out. It's changing, and it's getting stronger.

When you're feeling this energy moving, it's time to start working on your breathing. As you breathe in, put your hands in front of your heart or belly. Then, as you breathe out, bring your hands back together. This is the breath.

You don't have to do this for very long, though it can take some practice, and you may find that you can do it easily enough on your own. The important thing is to do it.

The Specific Breath

One of the most basic and most useful ways of channeling energy is by using the specific breath. The specific breath is a simple, natural and effective way of bringing energy into your body. It's good for anyone who wants to learn how to move energy in their body. The specific breath is a combination of the major breath parts your diaphragm and lungs.

To do the specific breath, you breathe in and out. After each breath, try to feel that energy moving through you. Just breathe in and out, as though you're bringing a large amount of energy into your body, and let that energy flow out. You can get started fairly simply, by counting your breaths. Keep counting until you feel that energy moving through your body. This will take some practice, though. When you're feeling it, have fun with it.

After you're comfortable with this, you can start to add other parts, like the belly, throat, and throat. You can do this by adding a new breath after every other breath. For example, if you normally breathe in for three breaths, add a new breath after two of those. You can do this with any breath, not just the specific breath. It's a little more complicated than just counting your breaths, though.

The Specific Breath is a great way to help

 breathing evenly and regularly. This will help you relax. Some people find that it's easier to regulate their breathing if they count, or if they chant a simple tone, like "Om," as they inhale and exhale. The more often you do this, the easier it will become.

Once your breathing is regulated and even, it's time to begin visualizing energy. This may seem weird if you've never done it before. Rub the palms of your hands lightly together, as though you were trying to warm them, and then move them an inch or two apart. You should still feel a charge, a tingling sensation between your palms.

==================== COMPLETION 315 ====================
 can feel a sort of energy in this area of the body when you concentrate on it, but most of us are just pretty good at not noticing it. Next, imagine that energy moving up and down in a pulsing pattern, like an electric current. This is energy flowing from the top of your head down through your stomach. Feel it pulse, and then let it go. You can feel it expand and contract in the same way. You can also let it go and feel it expand further and further out. As it does, you should feel a tingling in your chest and then your stomach, and then your chest again. This completes the cycle.

Gathering your energy

Once you've established a sense of how to feel your body and how to move it, you can begin to train your hands to gather energy. This is different from your "basic" practice of focusing on the breath and imagining it moving up and down your throat, and can be a great way to increase your energy. The idea is that by moving your hands, you'll be able to feel your energy flowing through your whole body through the energy centers in your hands.

To start, you'll need a seat, a desk or an armchair, and some books. Put a cushion on the floor under the chair. Place your hands on the floor in front of you, cupped around the back of your chair, and close your eyes. Imagine that you're sitting on a cushion in front of you, and that your feet are resting on the floor, your hands resting on the back of your chair. You shouldn't be moving, you should be still. Now, focus your attention on your hands. Feel your hands change. They can become cold, or hot, or just plump up. They can be soft, or firm. Sometimes they can feel and look different, too. A lot of people wonder why they feel a different sensation when they focus on their hands. Some people think it's because their hands are their bodies and they naturally have a certain energy. Others think it's because they just feel that way. Whatever the reason, it's pretty fascinating to explore!

The key is that you don't really move your hands. You just feel them change, and then let them go. This is a very simple way to train your hands. And it works. Start by concentrating on one hand, feel how it changes, and then let it go. Repeat with the other hand. Don't worry about making the energy change in front of you; just focus your attention on the hand you're focusing on.

If you're working with people, you can use the same technique to try to activate their energy centers. You can try touching each other's hands, or even touching each other's feet. Just be aware of how you're moving your hands. After a few minutes, you'll get a sense of whether or not that technique is working for you or not.

Practice helps

This is just one technique, but it's a simple one. It works very well. If you're working with people, you can try this technique on them to increase the energy you have in your hands. Or you can try making up some exercises to create your own energy centers. Just play with it. It's a great way to increase your energy circulation and your own awareness of energy. If you're not sure if you can do this, don't worry. It's not hard. And it can be fun.

It may be helpful to go over this again with a friend who's interested in doing this. You can even share the same chair or the same books as you did with the first person. That way, you can both see each other's energy.

==================== COMPLETION 316 ====================
 should feel this energy in or around your bones, or even in your muscles. Whatever you choose to focus on, you can draw energy from it. Try drawing energy from it with your hands. Feel it in your fingers. Feel it in your feet. Feel it in your jaw.

As you can see, the more you practice, the more you can draw energy from this physical response by focusing on it. You can even use this energy to transform yourself by changing your physical response to the energy. Don't try to stop your breathing, just let it happen, and then transform it to flow into you.

How to tap into it

Now that you know how to visualize energy, it's time to take that knowledge and apply it to how you tap into it.

To do this, you first need to let go of your concerns about the future. This is an important first step, because the future is not something that exists in the present. At best, you can only know what you know now. So the first thing you need to do is stop thinking about the future, and start thinking about what you want to do in the future.

Here are some practical ideas:

Forget about worries about the future. Instead, focus on what you want to do now.

Instead, focus on what you want to do now. Instead of worrying about the future, focus on what you want to do in the present.

 when binge eating seems very appealing. I think it's important to accept that, and realize that at times, you may indeed feel deprived. However, it's not really you that's deprived – you are depriving your lower brain and a life-draining habit, and you are getting stronger with each conquered urge. Feelings of deprivation, of strong attraction to binge eating, of ambivalence about quitting – these are some of the more tricky and enticing ways that the urges to binge present themselves. If you can get to the point where you can experience all these feelings without reacting or acting, you will be well on your way to killing off the habit for good.


What to do if resisting urges in this way feels like a struggle/white knuckling:


I personally think if you are finding it extremely difficult to resist urges (if it feels like a fight); it is usually one of two things:

1.) You are not eating enough/ still dieting restrictively. If you are not eating sufficiently, you'll likely keep your body and brain in "survival" mode, and I truly believe urges that arise because of survival instincts are much harder to detach from than urges that arise due to habit. I think limiting calories and trying
==================== COMPLETION 317 ====================
 to get leaner and stronger will help, but it's not a cure-all.

2.) You are eating too many calories/ not eating enough. If you are eating too many calories, you'll likely keep the urge to binge, but I think the urge to binge is an important ingredient in keeping the urge to binge from getting out of hand. If you are truly underweight, or you're not eating enough calories, I recommend you reach a weight where you feel comfortable in your body. If you are over-eating, I would suggest you try this:

1.) Get some exercise.

2.) Eat smaller meals than you normally do.

3.) When you eat, try to eat smaller portions.

4.) Eat a balanced diet – don't be afraid to eat more foods than you normally eat.

5.) If you are eating too many calories, begin to cut back on your calorie intake.

6.) If you are still unable to resist the urge to binge, I would suggest you go for a walk, take a nap, do some yoga, or do some other activity that makes you feel good. Doing something that you don't mind feeling bad about, but which also helps you feel good and reduces the urge to binge, can be very effective.


I've been reading this book for some time, and I'm convinced that its message is something that many people need to hear. If anyone out there is struggling with a binge attack, or a similar problem, please read this book. It won't be easy, but it will be a journey worth taking.


Thank you for reading, and I hope you'll find this helpful.

"I'm not like most people," Trump declared in a September 2014 interview, "and I'm not getting rich doing this."

He's not, of course. Trump has made a fortune over the years through real estate deals, casinos, licensing deals, and licensing deals. He's also made money off the Trump brand.

But he's kept a low profile on his tax returns while his opponents do their best to make his tax returns public.

Trump has paid $0 in federal income taxes since 1977, according to an analysis by the New York Times.

"It's not illegal, but it is very unfair," said Gary Bauer, who has been running for the Republican presidential nomination since 1996. "You have to be smart about it."

In his first major interview since his long-anticipated tax return was released, Trump explained in a Tuesday interview with ABC News' David Muir that he's not stupid, he doesn't think he's stupid, and he doesn't care.

"I'm very rich," Trump said. "I have a great company. I have a great company, great business. I don't care."

The question is, is Trump actually "smartly" avoiding paying any federal income tax?

The Washington Post's Fact Checker rated Trump's claim that he's not paying federal income tax "mostly false."

"In a campaign where every word counts, Trump is going to have to explain why he's paying so little in federal income taxes," said the Post's Glenn Kessler.

But Trump's claim that he's not paying federal income tax may have something to do with the fact that his real estate holdings have a negative

 to maintain a healthy weight is an important first step towards not indulging in these urges.

2.) You are eating too much/ or not enough of the food you prefer. If you are not eating enough of the food you prefer, I think it's very important to do a food journal (at least once a week). Make a list of the foods you have eaten in the last 24 hours and the quantity of each. This will help you check on your weight gain/loss and allow you to identify when your body is craving certain foods.

3.) You are not eating enough/ or not enough of the food your mind is craving. If you are not eating enough of the food your mind is craving, I think it's important to do a food journal. Make a list of the foods you have eaten in the last 24 hours and the quantity of each. This will help you check on your weight gain/loss and allow you to identify when your body is craving certain foods.

4.) You are not doing enough/ or not enough of the activities that help you feel better/ decrease the urge to binge. If you aren't doing enough of the activities you like, I think it's important to do a food journal. Make a list of the activities you like to do and the quantity of each. This will help you monitor your weight gain/loss and help you identify when your body is craving certain activities.

Make a list of the foods you have eaten in the last 24 hours and the quantity of each. This will help you monitor your weight gain/loss and help you identify when your body is craving certain foods.


First, learn to accept that you will have urges. You'll feel like you're not good enough, you're not as good as the person you thought you were, you're not in control anymore, etc. You may even feel like you're doomed to fall into this habit forever. However, I feel like you are not doomed to this habit forever. You have the ability to break free from it, and once you do, I believe you will feel amazing. Here's what I do to break free from binge eating habits:


Have a Plan. What steps do you need to take to break a binge eating habit? For me, I decide to look at my food journal (2-3 times a week) and make a list of the foods I have eaten on that day. This helps me see how much I've eaten, how many calories I've eaten, and how many calories I've burned. I also make a list of the foods I have eaten during the day. You can do the same thing! I make a list of the foods you like to eat, and this helps you to monitor your weight gain/loss activity, determine if you're dieting, and keep an eye on your calorie intake. I also make a list of the foods you like to do, and this helps you monitor your weight gain/loss activity (I have a friend who makes a list of all the things she'd like to do, and then makes a list of all the things she'd like to buy). I have seen people take away half a pound in weight in 24 hours simply from making these lists.

If you are dieting: Take your time. Take the time to do the things you want to do, rather than the things you think you should do. This is a great way to not only make a change in your life, but it is also a great way to have a healthy relationship with yourself and your body.

==================== COMPLETION 319 ====================
 to not diet is a crucial step on the path towards recovery. It's also important to remember that when you are restricting calories, you'll need to eat more to maintain your weight, and this most likely will lead to cravings or a need to binge.

2.) You are becoming addicted to a certain food or beverage. If you are still dieting, you are likely to feel trapped and stuck in a cycle of dieting – and this will likely lead to binge eating. This is obviously a very serious issue for those who are enduring a traditional dieting cycle. However, it can also happen to anyone who is struggling with binge eating, and I believe it is in part because of the way that a person's body responds to the dopamine (reward) system.

If you can avoid or overcome these two hurdles, and your urges are still very much a part of your life, then you are on the right track.

You need to be strong and be able to take action, and I think that the best way to do this is to start with your brain.

Feelings of craving and of wanting to binge – or to save space in your fridge for binge foods – are not really you – they are merely the result of your brain's attempt to stabilize or compensate for excitement and taste-based addiction.

You are not starving, and you are not starving your brain.

You are not starving your body, and you are not starving your brain.

You are not starving your dogs, and you are not starving your brain.

The only way to effectively resist urges and binge is to fight them with your mind.

I think this is the first step you need to take if you are struggling with binge eating – to disconnect from the triggers and embrace the process of recovery.

Binge eating can be a challenging and complicated issue – but it's one that is best tackled with a lot of hard work, and with a lot of patience.

The best way to overcome binge eating is to stop fighting it, and to accept that your body and brain will always want to eat when it's excited and hungry, and to accept that you will be tempted to binge when your body is physically and mentally ready to do so.

I really believe that the only way to truly no longer binge is to stop fighting it, to embrace the process, and to embrace all those emotions and urges that are coming up.

I will be posting more about the effects of binge eating and the process of recovery in the coming weeks, so stay tuned!

I think limiting calories and trying
==================== COMPLETION 320 ====================
 to build muscle is the best way to build a strong body.

2.) You do not really care about eating less. When I first started dieting, I was very much in the habit of eating for survival. This led to me losing my appetite and eating more than I needed to. Now I eat in moderation (I eat in the evening. I do not eat late at night. I do not eat very often. I eat only when I am in a state of fullness (fullness is when my body is satisfied with food). I don't eat when I am feeling hungry but I also don't eat when I am full. I eat because I am hungry; I don't eat because I am full. I do not eat when I am in a state of fullness. I don't eat when I am hungry but I also don't eat when I am full.

I actually think these two things can go hand-in-hand, because I have found that it is easier to change your brain and body when you do not care what you eat. When you are in a state of fullness, it is easier to keep your body in survival mode. This is because you are more motivated to maintain the state of fullness than you are to lose it. I think it's important to change your mentality and make sure you are no longer dieting in this way, because it will only limit your amount of effort you can put into your dieting.

A way to make sure you are not dieting in this way is to have realistic expectations. If you are afraid your body will not hold weight loss in good regard, you may want to eat less. This is not to say that you shouldn't eat less. I always enjoy a good dinner, but I don't act like I am starving and I don't think of myself as starving (I know that I am not). When you are in a state of fullness, you don't worry about your body holding onto weight loss, you just focus on the feeling of fullness and how good it feels. And this is enough to keep your hunger in check.

If you are finding it extremely difficult to resist urges, it is probably due to anxiety. Anxiety can come from the fear of being judged for their weight, or the fear of being teased or rejected because of their weight. Let me tell you, eating disorder treatment is often quite challenging, and I am not suggesting that you should abandon your treatment because of a couple of tough days. However, if you are finding it extremely difficult to resist urges, it is likely due to anxiety. We need to work on self-compassion and work on getting rid of the fear of judgment, and I think working on these things will help you combat your urges.

A way to make sure you are not dieting in this way is to always plan to eat meals, not snacks. I don't mean to say that you need to eat every meal, but you should plan ahead and limit your snacks to only those that you really feel like you need to eat. If you are eating snacks, you are likely in a state of being hungry.

If you are finding it extremely difficult to resist urges, it is likely due to a lack of willpower. If you are naturally gifted at resisting urges, you will likely have more success with the process of eating less than a person who may have a lot of willpower issues.

To combat the urges to binge eat, I strongly recommend the following:

1.) Get plenty of sleep

This is one of the most important things that I can think of to help you out. The reason I say this is because the body is not designed to wake up at night and binge eat. Sleeping is

 Matt Alonzo said: "He acted as a good Samaritan, just like everybody else, and tried to help before emergency services arrived."

Ford and others helped the female driver out of the vehicle he said.

The woman, who was the only occupant of the saloon car, escaped with minor injuries, authorities told local newspaper Ventura County Star.

'Lost control'

According to the California Highway Patrol (CHP), the 63-year-old was driving eastbound in the fast lane of Highway 126 at about 10.55am local time when, for unknown reasons, her car drifted left into the central reservation.

Officer Tom Kirkland, a spokesman for the CHP, said that when the woman put on the brakes, she lost control of the car and it swerved right across all the eastbound lanes and down an embankment.

The woman, in her 30s, from south west London, reported the man a month ago after discovering he had been watching her via Facebook.

Police launched an investigation into the man and arrested him early on Monday.

The man is being held on suspicion of voyeurism, sexual assault, and sexual activity with a child.

The Metropolitan Police said the man had been using the social network to communicate with the victim, who was believed to be aged in her 30s.

They added that they were, at this stage, unable to say when the crime took place or what the man was doing with the victim.

The force added that it would, however, be investigating the possibility that the man had been using the social network for "illicit purposes".

The woman contacted police after the man became increasingly involved in her life and began posting explicit images of himself on Facebook, the force added.

It said: "The victim is a vulnerable adult who has been the victim of sexual exploitation. She reported this to the police and we are investigating her allegations."<|endoftext|>A former Vancouver police officer who was fired after his department was rocked by allegations of sexual harassment and racial profiling has had his employment reinstated by the city.

In a statement issued Tuesday, the City of Vancouver said its human resources department had "reviewed and approved the reinstatement of Const. Gary Dawson" last week.

"Mr. Dawson was reinstated as a police officer on July 19, 2015," said the statement, which was released to CBC News by Dawson's lawyer, Paul Lewin.

Lewin said he was unaware of the city's decision to reinstate Dawson until CBC News asked him about it.

Dawson was fired in November after a CBC News investigation revealed he had been accused of using racial slurs and sexist language against Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women.

Since the allegations surfaced, Dawson has denied wrongdoing.

A former Vancouver police constable who was fired after his department was rocked by allegations of sexual harassment and racial profiling has had his employment reinstated by the city. 1:19

In the statement Tuesday, the city said it had conducted a review of Dawson's personnel file, as well as the allegations and the discipline imposed upon him.

"The review indicates that Mr. Dawson has acted appropriately in the circumstances and the discipline imposed by his employer, the Vancouver Police Department," the statement said.

"The City of Vancouver has also reviewed the disciplinary record of Constable Dawson and concluded that his conduct has been consistent with this organization's values."

Dawson, a licensed firearms trainer, was hired by the Vancouver Police Department in March 2012. He was later placed on paid administrative leave.

He was dismissed in November after allegations surfaced that he had been caught on tape using racist slurs and sexist language against Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women.

In a statement to CBC News, the Vancouver Police Department said it "has been made aware of allegations regarding Const. Dawson, and we are taking the matter very seriously."

"The Vancouver Police Department takes all allegations of misconduct very seriously and we have an extensive disciplinary process in place," the statement said.<|endoftext|>New at SubtleTV! Close

Ford and others helped the female driver out of the vehicle he said.

The woman, who was the only occupant of the saloon car, escaped with minor injuries, authorities told local newspaper Ventura County Star.

'Lost control'

According to the California Highway Patrol (CHP), the 63-year-old was driving eastbound in the fast lane of Highway 126 at about 10.55am local time when, for unknown reasons, her car drifted left into the central reservation.

Officer Tom Kirkland, a spokesman for the CHP, said that when the woman put on the brakes, she lost control of the car and it swerved right across all the eastbound lanes and down an embankment.

Ford checked the woman was all right before leaving. He was not a witness to the crash and didn't provide any statements, officer Kirkland said.

The book is fully illustrated and has over 85 pages. It contains the rules in the simplest possible way. It is a great way for new players to learn the game, as it does not require any complex role playing skills.

For the full rules, please download the PDF of the full rule book here.

The game is a game of strategy, in the form of a board game. It is easy to learn, and easy to play. It has been designed by the creator of this site, and is played by both new and experienced players alike.

The game is played by two to four players. The game is played over a series of turns, with each player having several actions in their hand. Players must plan their moves in advance, as they will be facing the same opponent on each turn.

The game is a game of bluffing, as the players must try to convince the other players they are bluffing. If the players can convince one of the other players, they win the game!

The game plays in about 45 minutes, with each player taking about 15-30 minutes to learn the rules.

The game is played in two rounds, each round lasting about 5 minutes.

The game is played between one and three players.

The game is not balanced. It is a game of strategy, and a game of bluffing.

The game is not a race, as the players can delay their actions for as long as they like.

Who We Are

We are two young people who love board games.

We are both 28 years old. Both of us grew up playing games, and learned to play a few years ago. At the moment we both have jobs in the creative industry, and are both trying to finish their degrees in the same subject.

We love games, and have played many games with friends and family, but we were always baffled as to what we would do if we had a million dollars to spend on games. We thought it would be great to make a game that we know we can play with other people, and we hope that this game will inspire others to get out and play games with their friends.

We are passionate about games, and want to see this project succeed.

The Benefits of this Project

We believe that this project will be awesome. We have been playing the game for years, and have shared the game with a few people. It is great fun, and has taught people new things about thinking and bluffing. We have had other games made for us, but this one is by far the best one that we have ever played. We are proud to have helped to make it a reality.

Some of the rewards you can get for backing this project:

1) The game printed on a beautiful laminated card stock. This will make this game very well protected and look great.

2) The game printed on a high quality board. This will make the game very well protected and look great.

3) The game printed on a beautiful, hardwood box. This will make the game very well protected and look great.

4) The game printed on a premium, thick card stock. This will make the game very well protected and look great.

5) The game printed on a premium, thick board. This will make the game very well protected and look great.

6) All of the cards are high quality, and will be printed on premium card stock.

The proposed government funding includes $1.1 billion for the first phase of the new Downtown Eastlink light-rail line, which would connect the Surrey SkyTrain station to the downtown area.

The additional funding for the second phase of the line would be $495 million. The third and final phase would cost $1.3 billion.

Story continues below advertisement

The province is also proposing to give Metro Vancouver's Transportation Ministry $1.5 billion to pay for the construction of a second phase of the Downtown Eastlink light-rail line. This would be a new line on the existing SkyTrain route around the Surrey Downtown Centre.

Transportation Minister Todd Stone says the money will allow the province to build the second phase of the line, which will be made up of two new stations – one in Surrey and one in Burnaby – and would be completed by 2022. "We have to get this going," Mr. Stone said.

The government has already committed $1.5 billion from the recent provincial budget to pay for the first phase of the Downtown Eastlink.

The proposed funding comes as B.C. continues to grapple with a $1.9-billion funding gap in the provincial transit budget, which has been made worse by the election of Christy Clark as premier in May, 2011.

The NDP government has been attempting to make up the shortfall with a series of additional tax increases, and has been pushing for the province to extract new revenue from the car-sharing service Uber.

But the government has been unable to agree on a plan to withdraw the province's involvement in the car-sharing service, which has been very popular with B.C. residents, particularly in Vancouver.

The government also announced a $100-million increase in funding for the Downtown Eastlink project.

The new funding is being provided by TransLink, which has been allocated $1.3 billion by the province to build the second phase of the light-rail line.

TransLink has said that the cost of building the second phase of the line could be as high as $3.7 billion, but that the second phase could cost as little as $1.5 billion.

The Regional District of Central Okanagan, which represents the municipalities of Coquitlam, Penticton and Mission, has been pushing for greater investment in transit to address its worsening traffic congestion.

Commuters in the Lower Mainland are already suffering through an annual average of 45,000 vehicle kilometres travelled.

The province has also been looking to reduce the number of cars on the road in the Lower Mainland – a task that has been ongoing since 2006.

Mr. Stone said that B.C. is looking to increase the number of transit vehicles on the road, but that the province has not yet decided how to achieve that goal.

"We know that there are a number of routes that are underutilized. If we increase transit ridership, it will help relieve congestion in the Lower Mainland," he said.

Mr. Stone added that the province will also explore ways to encourage more people to buy electric vehicles.

"We have to move forward in a smart way," he said. "We need to look at this in a way that will allow us to reduce congestion and encourage fewer vehicles on

"I think he's been aware of the investigation into the Russian interference into the election, the contacts that he's had with foreign nationals and officials, and I think he's been aware of the FBI inquiry," Ty Cobb told MSNBC's "Morning Joe."

"I think he's been aware of the fact that our intelligence community has concluded that Russia tried to interfere with the American election process," Cobb added.

"I think he's been aware of the fact that, you know, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has expressed some questions about the intelligence community's assessment."

Cobb said the president has not yet been shown evidence that his campaign colluded with Russian officials to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential race.

"But I think he's aware of our committee's investigation, and I think he's aware of the interest of the American people in getting to the bottom of what happened," Cobb said.

Trump has vehemently denied any collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia, calling the probe a "witch hunt." His comments have cast doubt on the independence of the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, former FBI Director Robert Mueller.

Mueller's probe has reportedly expanded to look at potential obstruction of justice in the Trump campaign's alleged efforts to shut down a federal investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Cobb said Monday the White House has not and will not try to shut down the Russia probe.

"It's not our responsibility to shut it down. It's our responsibility to make sure that it's done properly and appropriately," Cobb said.<|endoftext|>Here is the full transcript of the interview with John Roberts, which aired on "The Daily Show" on Wednesday night.

SYDNEY — John Roberts is the chief justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He is here in Australia for a few days as the country's top lawyer.

He's here here to represent the United States in a case that has become a symbol of American judicial independence: Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.

It's not a case that many people know about in the United States.

And Roberts, a former law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy, says he hopes it will not be.

"I think it's going to be of some interest to people here. I really do," he said.

He's here as the United States tries to persuade the Supreme Court to let the case move forward.

And he says he believes the court will be convinced that the First Amendment protects freedom of political speech.

"We think that it's the sort of case that will get the justices to say that we do not agree with the decision," he told "The Daily Show."

Roberts says he is not surprised that the United States is taking on Citizens United.

"It's been around for a long time. You know, the Supreme Court has decided that it's not just a First Amendment issue, it's a First Amendment issue," he said.

Roberts says he believes the decision to let Citizens United move forward will be appealed to the Supreme Court, where he thinks it stands a good chance of being overturned.

"I think the Obama administration is in a good position to win the case. I think the conservative justices will be inclined to take it up," he said.

Roberts says that

But this is all a hoax.

The story is a hoax, that's all.

The little girl in the pigtails and the little boy in the ruffled shirt are two of the fake members of the Vesterbro Kids Club.

They are working with a group called Red Vesterbro, which is the Swedish alternative name for the "Vesterbro Kids Club".

"The club's aim is to create a sense of community, a sense of belonging and to bring together young Swedes from diverse backgrounds," the club says on its website.

"The aim is to create an environment where children can go to school, learn together and at the same time socialise."

It's a lie.

The little girl in the pigtails is not a member of the club, but another of the fake members.

"I am not a member of the Vesterbro Kids Club," the little girl told TT news agency.

"I am a member of Red Vesterbro, of the Swedish analogue of the White Power Skinhead movement," she added.

The Vesterbro Kids Club was created by journalist and activist Joel Skjoldal in 2013.

The club claims to have about 1,000 members, and its website warns about neo-Nazis, skinheads, and other far-right extremists.

The expansion was larger than the 2.5 percent reported for the first three months of the year, and signals a solid start for the fourth quarter.

Though the second quarter's expansion was revised higher from the fourth quarter -- in the fourth quarter, the economy grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate -- the pace of growth in the third quarter is still up from the 2.1 percent posted in the second quarter.

"The U.S. economy has now notched two consecutive quarters of positive growth, and the third quarter is set to be the third strongest in history, with the economy growing at a 3.0 percent annual rate," said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed.com. "This is a sign that the U.S. has finally started to recover from the financial crisis."

"Ah, you want me to fight MMA again? So I'll get in there and tap right away, and the fight is over. I'd do it quickly. What I really want is other things for my life."

Aldo can retire anytime he wants, and he doesn't need to actually get his UFC contract terminated to do so. So why is he considering to go court against the promotion to cancel it if he has no plans fighting for other organizations?

"Because the same way I entered the UFC, I want to leave it," Aldo explains. "If one day I think about coming back, I'd come back to the UFC. That's where I came from and where I deserve to be. But I have other projects."

Asked if his "other projects" would not be possible if he's still under contract with the UFC, Aldo responded, "Absolutely. They have the rights for everything, even my breath. How can't they? I can't even breathe outside the UFC

Of course, Aldo also mentioned that he's not really a businessman, so he doesn't have the resources or know-how to start his own company.

So, yes, Aldo is staying with the UFC, and he plans to fight for a long time.

"I can't control the UFC," Aldo said. "I have my own side projects. I can't control the UFC. I'm not a businessman. I'm not an entrepreneur. I'm not an entrepreneur with a company. I'm just a fighter. I'm just a fighter. I'm just a fighter."<|endoftext|>Description

Stretch Goal #2 - $15,000: $7,500 - Unlock the one-shot "The Devil's Ratio" mini-story by Mark Lamia

The Devil's Ratio is a highly imaginative, funny, and at times disturbing mini-story that takes place on the moon. It features some of the most unique writing I've ever seen from Lamia, and is the perfect entry point for the series.

You are a young engineer named Mike, tasked with helping to evacuate a small group of scientists and engineers from an arctic research station. A meteor crash has decimated the station, leaving only 5 men left alive. As you begin your evacuation, you discover that the name of the station is "Gorilla Station."

The story unfolds over a series of short, four-page "novels," each of which takes you deeper into the story, introducing new characters and scenarios. The first novel features several different characters, including the head of the research group, an eccentric, and a "radiation expert."

The second and third novels feature additional characters, including a young girl and a young man with a heart condition.

The fourth novel is a stand-alone story that takes place on the moon, in the first part of the series.

The full series is due to be released in two volumes, with the first volume being released in October of 2014 and the second volume expected to be available in September of 2015.

Each book in the series will contain over 100 pages of fully-interactive, full-color, and professionally-illustrated artwork.

Each book will also come with a full-color, hardcover edition, including a full-color poster of the artwork, an 8.5 x 11" full-color art book, and a leather-bound, trade-paperback edition.

The paperback editions will be available as limited editions of 96 pages in a black and white/color combination, with the first and second volumes containing approximately 75 pages each. The hardcover editions will be limited to 200 copies, and will include a hardcover edition, as well as a hardcover poster, art book, and a black and white/color combination.

Some of the images are prototypes, and they have not been finalized. If you'd like to see them before they're finalized, please email me: hi@gogoproject.com.

The book is a complete narrative, and will contain all of the full-color illustrations, as well as a full-color poster, art book, and black and white/color combination.

The book is also a perfect introduction for people looking to try out an interactive graphic novel or graphic novel anthology, and will also be a great resource for anyone interested in the art and design of the graphic novel form.

Aldo's future is still very much in question. The Brazilian doesn't have any partner or team in the process of landing a new fight, and he's not even sure he'll be able to set foot in the Octagon once the UFC doesn't renew his contract next year.

"I don't know if I'll spend the next four years of my life fighting two or three times a year or if I'll spend the next four years of my life living a business or an entrepreneur," Aldo says. "I'm just looking for something else now. I want to have a different life, and I want to be free.

The study, co-authored by UC Berkeley computer science professor Rebecca MacKenzie, shows that parents are still a major force in shaping their children's online behaviors. The results are published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior.

Throughout history, people have been concerned with social control and the control of their own behavior. Today, the focus is on the Internet and other forms of computer technology, which allow people to have a more direct influence on other people's lives.

"One of the things we wanted to test with this research was how parents, who have a lot of control over their children's Internet use, are still able to shape their children's online behavior, and how their children experience the Internet as a result," said MacKenzie, who is also a professor of human-computer interaction in the computer science and engineering department.

In the study, participants were given the chance to play a computer role-playing game between March and May 2009, and were asked to describe their interactions on the game's chat room.

Although the study was conducted relatively soon after the Internet was introduced in the United States, MacKenzie said it was surprising to find that parents still have a significant influence on how their children use the Internet.

Parents, for example, tend to use the Internet to connect with their children and set up computer-based games with the children's friends. MacKenzie said that parents also will act as moderators and editors of chat rooms, noting, "One of the things you see is that if you're a parent, you're very active in the chat rooms, and there are some of your children who are involved in the chat rooms, so they're not just sitting at home in the basement."

MacKenzie said that the study found that children who were more dependent on their parents' input for game play tended to spend more time playing.

"We found that the younger the child was when they first started to play the game, the more time they spent playing," said MacKenzie, who is also a professor of psychology and of public health and biomedical engineering. "If we really wanted to measure the amount of time they spent playing, we would have to do that as soon as they started to play."

The study also found that children who spent more time playing the game were more likely to spend more time reporting on the chat room. MacKenzie

 -- I have to do everything with the UFC."

Undoubtedly, Aldo's comments were meant to be a shot at the UFC's current structure, which allows fighters to enter the promotion and fight for other organizations while still retaining their UFC contracts.

After all, Aldo is the only fighter to ever successfully return from retirement and fight for a title.

"I never left the UFC," Aldo says. "I never left the UFC. I'm never leaving the UFC. I'm not coming back to fight for another organization. I'm fighting here.

"If someone asks me if I'm going to fight for another organization, I'll say yes. But I'm not going to fight for another organization. (Because) I'm not going to fight for another organization and not have a contract with the UFC. Period."

Aldo's comments come on the heels of his teammate, former lightweight champion Frankie Edgar, who said he would not go to California to fight for the promotion.

"They want to kill me," Edgar said, via MMA Fighting. "I'll fight anywhere, but not for them. I'm not fighting for them or any promotion. I'm not fighting for anyone. I'm fighting for myself, and that's all I need, and that's all I'm going to say."

While Aldo's comments are certainly intriguing, they also come on the heels of a possible announcement about a UFC/WWE crossover event similar to the Super Bowl in February.

"You'll see something in February," Aldo says. "I don't know, but you'll see something in February. I'm sure there will be something."<|endoftext|>Current slide {CURRENT_SLIDE} of {TOTAL_SLIDES}- Best Selling in Can Opener

Judge Richard J. Leon ruled in U.S. v. Jones that the government had violated the Fourth Amendment by secretly collecting and retaining all Internet communications without a warrant, and without the probable cause necessary for a warrant, and without a finding that the communications were relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. The ruling was also a major blow to the NSA's domestic surveillance programs.

Judge Leon said that the government had misapplied "third party doctrine" to get around the Fourth Amendment, in that the records at issue were not the subject of a search warrant, but instead belonged to the telecommunications companies.

Third party doctrine is a long-standing principle of constitutional law that permits government officials to access records not related to a specific investigation, and that limits the government's ability to search records it has obtained by requesting a court order. The government argued that it was entitled to access the records without the usual warrant requirement because it was collecting a broad sweep of communications information, and the records were not related to a specific investigation.

After the feds first began collecting such records under the Patriot Act, the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 in U.S. v. Jones that the government could not obtain records under the program if it did not apply for a warrant, and it also ruled that the government's collection of

It makes me think of someone doing something so incredibly bad that they deserve to be punished, not of someone who is raped. I don't think that anyone who has been raped should be punished, but I also don't think that anyone who isn't raped should be punished either.

I've always had a weird relationship with the word "rape," because it makes me nauseous.

I know there is a difference between being raped and being violated, but I still struggle with the word "rape." It's hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that I have been raped, because I know that I could never, ever do something so bad. So why, then, does it feel so good?

I don't know if I'm alone in this struggle. I don't think I am.

The world is full of stories about women who have been raped. They are everywhere: in books, in movies, on the internet, and in our collective consciousness. But for the most part, these stories are often told in a way that is dismantling of the experiences of the victims, as opposed to building on them. To find a good example of that would require me to look at the entire history of the word "rape" from the perspective of the victim, and how it has been used to attack and silence them.

In the eighteenth century, the word "rape" was used mostly to describe sexual activity between men and women. The term was only first associated with women's sexual experiences in the nineteenth century, when it was used to describe the "abuse of women by men." The term was again used to describe rape in the twentieth century. A June 1953 New York Times article, "An American Rape," described a rape that had taken place at an all-night party in a hotel in Manchester, England. The victim's accusation against the accused was that he "had forced himself upon her after having broken open her dress and had thrust his penis in her mouth."

"An American Rape" (1953)

The term "rape" then became the main tool used by feminists to attack men and masculinity as a whole.

In the 1970s, feminist writer Andrea Dworkin argued that the term "rape" was used as a cultural term to attack all men and masculinity. "Rape," she said, was "a weapon of misogyny. It is a word that has been used to attack all men, all of the time."

In the 1980s, feminist writer Janice Fiamengo used the term "rape" to attack the idea that men and women can have different roles or functions in society. "Rape," she wrote, "is a term that is used to silence, to silence the females who are subjected to it. Rape is a word that is used to destroy the feminine identity."

In the 1990s, feminist writer Sheila Jeffreys used the word "rape" to describe an experience of male power over women. "The rapist," Jeffreys argued, "is a man who uses his power against a woman."

"Rape" has been used to attack and to silence women, but it has also been used to attack and to silence men.

In the 2000s, feminist writer Naomi Wolf used the word "rape" to attack the idea that women and men have equal rights and responsibilities. "R

't make ourselves fall asleep. These are things that happen to us. So, between the active analytical side of the spectrum and the passive, memory-intensive, drifting part of the spectrum, there is an entire range of different moods, different types of consciousness, different approaches to the mental world that surrounds us, different ways in which our mind operations.

 argue that maybe the human mind is a kind of infinite and dynamic thing moving in a range of different directions and that the way we think, the way we're constructed, the way we perceive things, is a product of that. And I'm wondering if you could give us a way to think about that. David Gelernter: Yeah. So, I think that the book--I think that I try to be very careful about the way I present these ideas. I try to present them in the proper way, and not in the way that would seem obvious. So, for example, the way that I talk about our concept of consciousness--I talk about it in a very straightforward way, as a kind of exotic, kind of exotic quality. And yet, I don't think that that's obvious. I think that it's very helpful to think about when you were first learning to read, and a lot of people are now learning to read; when you first learned to read, how do you think about the words? And you think about the words as they are and the words as they appear to you. And then you develop your own metaphors, for example. And you pick up the words. How do you think about the words as they appear to you? I try to do this with the book. So, when you first see the pictures in the book, and you see the pictures, and you see the pictures and you see the pictures. And then you think about what they mean. And then you try and find a way to explain to yourself what they mean. And so that's how we think about consciousness as a way of looking at the world. And then, when you are in the same room with the same person who is doing something, and the person is doing something very specific, you might try and think about what the person is doing. And then you might try to explain to yourself what they are doing. And then you might try and explain to yourself what the person is doing. And so that's how we think about consciousness. And then, when you are in the same room with the same person who is doing something that is not so specific, you might try and think about what the person is doing. And then you might try and explain that. And then you might try and explain that. And so that's how we think about consciousness. And then, when you are in the same room with the same person who is doing something that is not so difficult, and you are doing something very difficult, and you are working with somebody that you are working with who is very, very difficult--you might try and think about what the person is doing. And then you might try and explain that. And then you might try and explain that. And so that's how we think about consciousness. And so, the way that I talk about it in the book is that it's a kind of exotic, exotic quality. And it's a quality that we tend to use in very specific ways. And so, then, when we try and think about how we are thinking about the world, what we are doing in our mind, how we are thinking about our lives, I think it's very helpful to think about different ways of thinking about it, and different ways of doing it. And then, when you are in the same room with the same person who is doing something that is very difficult--you are working with somebody who is very, very difficult--you might try and think about what the person is doing. And then you might try and explain that. And then you might try and explain that. And then you might try and explain that and you might try and explain that until you have a very particular way of looking at it. And then, when you are in the same

==================== COMPLETION 334 ====================
 argue, you argue that there's a danger in saying that we are all in the same Up or Down neurologically. You argue there's a danger in saying that the same thing is going on in the brain, and that some people are more 'High' and others are more 'Low'. I mean, has there been a change in the past 20 years or so in our culture about the way we think of these kinds of differences between people? David Gelernter: Yes. I think that if we take a look at some of the claims that are being made, that different people are in the same Up or Down category--well, there's a lot of evidence that supports the claim that there are differences in the brain. But, it's the claim that the differences are caused by differences in the brain, not caused by differences in the person. And that's the fundamental problem. So, for example, the people who are addicted to heroin and cocaine--that's the traditional example of the difference between the High and the Low. Well, that's nonsense. They are all addicted to the same addictive drugs. And there is no such thing as a high and a low. Addiction, or the way that the brain works and how it produces the effects of addiction, is very much a continuum. Some people are very, very high and others are very, very low. But, it's not caused by the brain. So, that's the first problem. The second problem is that there's a lot of evidence that argues that these kinds of differences between people are not caused by differences in the brain. That they are caused by differences in how different people think about their own minds and about the world. And this is the difference between the Up and the Down. And, this is something that is very central to the psychology of our culture. So, I think that the culture has changed a lot. And the reason for that is that the culture has changed a lot. In the past, we have had a very narrow view of what it is that people are good at, and what it is that people are not good at. They could be good at anything. And, up until the last 20 or 30 years, we have been very open to our own self-interest. And, that's a very different way of looking at the world than it used to be. And it's more of a social system. And it's less a part of our biology and our biology is very important to it. And I think that that's been a very important change. So, the second problem is that there are no differences between people in their ability to think about their own minds. And, if there were, then we would expect to see them all in the same Up or Down category. We would expect to see the same things in their Up or Down category. But, there is no evidence for that. So, what we are left with is the claim that there are different kinds of minds. There's a difference between the High and the Low. And that's a claim that we can accept, or not. We can accept it or not. But, there's no evidence that we can accept it. And, I think that's been a very important change in our culture.

There's the kind that we think about, the Up Spectrum and the Down Spectrum. What are people who think there are two kinds of minds? And what's the evidence for that? David Gelernter: Well, that's an interesting question. There is no such thing as two kinds of minds. There is only one kind of mind. Russ Roberts: Correct. David Gelernter: And that's the kind that you experience in the world. And if you are one of us, you are one of us. If you are one of the people who is sleeping, you are one of us. But if you are one of the people who is awake, you are not. And that's a fact. If you are thinking about yourself, you are not thinking about yourself. But if you are thinking about something else, you are thinking about that. So, you are one of us. And if you are sleeping, you are not. And that's a fact. But if you are awake, you are not one of us. And that's a fact. And that's the first part of the question. And the other part of the question is--even when we are asleep, we are not thinking about ourselves. We are not thinking about what we are experiencing. We are not thinking about the experience that we have. We are just asleep. We are not thinking about anything. We are not thinking about anything. That's the first part of the question. And the other part of the question is: What kind of things are we experiencing that are as true as the fact of being asleep? And what does that mean? How do we understand the experience of being asleep? So, for example, when we are asleep, we are asleep in a different way than when we are awake, and different than when we are being awake. So, we are not being asleep, as we would be asleep if we were awake. We are being asleep only in a different way than we are being asleep when we are awake. We are not being asleep. We are not thinking about anything. We are not aware of anything. We are not aware of anything. We are not aware of anything. That's the first part of the question. And the other part of the question is: How do we understand the experience of being asleep? And the answer is that we don't know. We cannot know. We cannot tell. We can't tell. We cannot tell. What we do know is that when we are asleep, we are not thinking about anything. We are not thinking about anything. We are not aware of anything. We are not aware of anything.

We are being awake, but we are not being asleep. We are being awake. We are not being asleep; we are being awake. There is no experience that we would call sleep in the sense of being asleep. There is only sleep. There is only sleep. But when we are asleep, we are not thinking about anything. We are not thinking about anything. We are not aware of anything. We are not aware of anything.

I've spoken of Up Spectrum as the alert, wide-end end, and the Down Spectrum as the drowsier, sleepier, and sleep and dreaming end.

==================== COMPLETION 336 ====================
 argue that the Up and Down ranges are not just an artifact of the day/night cycle. They are fundamentally caused by the way we develop, as a species. So, you argue, that we are more prone to the Up spectrum because we have evolved to use tools, and tools are things that we are very good at. And we are an intuitive species. We are very good at solving problems with tools. And we are very good at memory. And we are very good at remembering things that happen in the future. And we are very good at remembering the past. And so, the people who are best at solving problems with tools, and solving problems with tools in a certain way, and the people who are best at remembering things that have happened in the past, and the people who are best at remembering things that have happened in the past are more likely to be associated with the Down spectrum, and the people who are best at using tools in a certain way are more likely to be associated with the Up spectrum. David Gelernter: Right. And I think it's also true that the people who are best at solving problems with tools are the people who are least likely to be able to solve problems with tools in other ways. So, for instance, the people who are most likely to be people who are good at solving problems with tools are also the people who are most likely to be people who are good at solving problems with language and other traditional tools. And they are also the people who are least likely to be able to solve problems with those traditional tools. And so, it's not that these people are always born with Down, but that they are more likely to have Down. And it's also not that these people are always born with Up, but that they are more likely to have Up. And so, it's not that these people are always born with up and down. It's that, if they are born, they are more likely to be born with Down. And if they are born, they are more likely to be born with Up. And so, there can be a lot of interplay of these. The people who are best at solving problems with tools are also the people who are most likely to be good at language and other traditional tools. And so, those are the people who are most likely to be able to solve problems using those traditional tools. And so, there is a lot of interplay of these factors. And so, the problem with the book--and this is the interesting part of the book--is that I don't think that the book is saying really what I think it is saying. It's saying that there are these different, different ways that we are evolving. And the book is saying, and I think it's true, that the Up and Down ranges are an artifact of our evolution. But I don't think it's saying that these are the only ways. And so, while I think the book is very interesting and provocative, I'm not sure that it's saying what I think it is saying. Russ Roberts: We'll get to that in a second. But let me just say that--it's a bit of a surprise to me that you--you argue that the Up and Down ranges are not just an artifact of our evolutionary history. I mean, I would think that, as a species, we would be more prone to the Up spectrum. It just seems like that's where we are. And it's not just that we're better at thinking. We're better at remembering. We're better at using tools. We're better at using language. We're better at using art. We're better at using other traditional tools. Russ Roberts: Right. And so, you argue that if we evolve in ways that make us more prone

Theodor Herzl, The Jewish State. A Modern Critique, London, 1914.) ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ "There is, of course, one sort of society in which every citizen is a citizen of the state and all the activities of the state are carried on by citizens, and this is a state in which every citizen is a citizen of the state." (J. B. Renan, The Perennial Philosophy, London, 1930.) "I am a citizen of the world!" (Colonel House, quoted in The Fortune of Nations, Chicago, 1918.) "You are a citizen of the world! That is all I ask. . . . I am a citizen of the world! I want to be a citizen of the world! I want the world to know me as a citizen of the world!" (Adolf Hitler.) The anti-Semitic movement in Germany met with success in a few hundred years only because its leaders were convinced that they were fighting a great struggle against a world Jewry and had the right to set up a new order in the world. Their first target should have been the Jews. The first question to be asked is : "Who is the Jew?" Then the rest will follow naturally. "Who is the Jew?" must be the starting point for the understanding of the whole problem. It is impossible to understand the whole problem of Germany without understanding the Jew. — Hermann Goering, Mein Kampf, London, 1933, Chapter VI The Secret German Policy in Poland During the early years of the war, the German government made no secret of its preference for Poland and the way in which it saw its future interests in the country. The policy was often described as a "Polish policy," because it disregarded the German-Polish differences and gave the Poles the impression that it was acting for their own interests. It is hard to see how a government can give the Poles the impression that it is acting for their own interests. It is, however, hard to see how any government could give the Poles the impression that they had the right to take over the German states. The Polish government, however, did not know how to respond to this kind of propaganda. It was able to form its own opinion about the German policy, to recognize its tendency to aggressiveness, and to understand the German desire for power. The Polish government was, however, at the same time an enemy of Germany. The Polish government had not tolerated the existence of the German minority in Poland, which had existed since the second half of the thirteenth century, nor had it tolerated the existence of the Polish minority in Germany, which had been there since the eighteenth century. The Polish government was still, in the eighteenth century, under German rule, but it did not recognize the existence of the Polish minority. Therefore, the Polish government did not recognize the right of the German minorities in Poland to help in the occupation of the country. The Polish government was against the acquisition of territories by force, and it was opposed to the use of force in the occupation of areas which had been conquered by the German armies. The Polish government was also against German colonization in Poland. The Polish government was a colony of Germany, and the Polish government was not the government of Poland. The Polish government was, however, willing to give the German minorities in Poland the impression that they had a right to take over the German states.

Theodor Herzl, The Jewish State, p. 12.) The main idea that drives the colonial policy of Germany is the ideology of Lebensraum. The ideology of Lebensraum is well described by Professor J. D. Brown: The German colonial policy is based on the idea that the world's two great powers, England and Russia,— both of them great colonial powers — have the right and the duty to extend their territories. . . . The German colonial policy is based, either consciously or unconsciously, on the idea that the world's two great powers, England and Russia, have the right and the duty to extend their territories. (The German Colon- ists, London, 1930, p. 1.) The expansion of Germany into the East, the desire to dominate it, and the desire to hold on to it, have all been the driving force in the German policy toward the East, and they all fell back on the ideology of Lebensraum. A large portion of the German people, the German intelligentsia, and the German military and industrial leaders have been devoted to the expansion of the German Empire. The entire German life was dedicated to the domination of the East. The German imperial policy throughout the world has and still is based on this ideology of Lebensraum. The overall idea of the doctrine of Lebensraum is that Germany must control the East or else perish. This doctrine was not a matter of expediency or opportunism, but was a deliberate policy of the German State. The French Empire, which followed the German example in so many of its colonial policies, was not able to stand against the German policy of expansion. The French Empire was defeated at the battle of Verdun, and its colonial possessions were lost in the Franco-German War. It was, therefore, only a matter of time before Germany, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, took over the French Empire's possessions in the East. The German Empire was able to extend its conquests throughout the world because the whole German life was dedicated to the conquest of the East.

T. R. Thiessen, The National Socialist Program, p. 1.) The Fuehrer's conception of an eastern Europe free of the Jewish influence was, therefore, so fundamentally influenced by the ideas of German nationalism that the idea of a Lebensraum for the Germans was inevitable. The Fuehrer was not only a man of his Party, but a man of his race, and it was only natural that he should have as his ideal of Europe and of the Aryan race a Lebensraum for his own people. The Fuehrer never thought of the future of Europe or of the Aryan race in terms of the merely temporary or national interests of this or that people. On the contrary, the future of Europe and of the Aryan race were bound up together and had to be one, and hence the Fuehrer and the National Socialist Party would have no quarrel with Germany's other neighbors. The Germans should not be excluded from the whole of Europe, but the German people should be able to live in a secure, prosperous and independent state, in the lands of the Slavs. The Fuehrer's idea of Lebensraum is embodied in the following sentence of the Third Reich's Statute for the Lebensraum Policy: All Germans are to be given a home in Europe but not in a separate state. The idea of a Lebensraum for the Germans was not a new one. It was the conception of the Prussians, the Dutch, the French and the British at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. The idea of Lebensraum, which was to become the fundamental principle of the National Socialist policy, was first put forward by Wilhelm II in a circular to all his ministers, which he sent to Berlin on September 7, 1871. The circular contained the following words: To the Prussian minister for the interior, the Prince-Bishop, the First Secretary of the Ministry for the Interior, the First Secretary of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the First Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, and the First Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior. Hitherto the Prussian State has been like a tent in which all of us can live together in peace and quiet. But the populace has been growing unbearably restless. There is a danger that this will lead to the establishment of a state of permanent tension which will render it impossible for the Prussians to govern. The state of tension could then lead to war. The Prussians, therefore, are to urge upon the German people the necessity of establishing a strong military state to be established in Germany, as well as a strong state for the police, administrative and judicial officials. The Prussians are to urge upon the German people the necessity of establishing a strong military state to be established in Germany.

The Prussians are to urge upon the German people the necessity of establishing a strong military state, and of establishing a strong state for the police, administrative and judicial officials. (W. II, sec. 2, p. 1) The Prussian minister for the interior, the Prince-Bishop, was the founder of the Prussian police. In this circular he stated that the Prussian police was legally and constitutionally the strongest in the world and that the Prussian people should be convinced that it was the duty of the Prussian government to keep the peace and to ensure the security of the Prussian people. The Prussian minister for the interior, the Prince-Bishop, was the founder of the Prussian police. In this circular

Mago: Is it? I don't know. I think that if you look at the Brazil of today, you've got the same kind of problems and the same kind of crisis that happened during the '60s, but you also have the same kind of identity that we have in Brazil today. You know, Brazilians have a deep sense of national identity, and that's what we have today in São Paulo.

I don't know if it's representative. The thing is, Brazilian music is not representative of Brazil. Brazilian music is representative of Brazil's history. I think that Brazil has its own national culture. We have different nationalities and different cultures.

Helen: Is it possible that it's our own culture?

Mago: I don't know what your question means. It's ironic, isn't it? Not many people know Brazil has its own culture. It's very hard to explain, because we know we're a country of many cultures and we have many different nationalities. But when you say Brazil has its own culture, maybe it's because we don't speak the same language. Because we speak English we have our own culture, and then we have some cultures—for instance, the culture of the Indians, and our own indigenous culture, that's different than the other culture. So it's a very complicated situation.

Helen: Brazil has a very different history from the United States, and its own culture.

Mago: It's complicated. When I was growing up, we didn't have problems. Now, we have problems. Now it's a different world.

Helen: You were in New York when you started your band, and you had a lot of success. What was it like to be in New York?

Mago: I had to move to New York because I was a musician and I wanted to play. I didn't have a job, so I had to go to New York. But I didn't have any money, so I had to stay on the street. It was very difficult to move around at that time. I had to get a bus that would take me to the city, and then I had to find my way. I went to New York for a couple of years, and then, when I started to play, I didn't go to New York anymore because I didn't have any money. So it was very difficult to find a place to stay.

Helen: Did you ever go to the West Village?

Mago: I didn't go to the West Village. I lived in the East Village, where I lived with my wife and a friend, and we had a place, a studio. We had a studio and we rented out studios to artists. So I did live in the West Village a few times, but I didn't go to the West Village.

Helen: What was the most difficult thing about the move to São Paulo?

So I was paying $3,000 a month, and I had to pay $2,000 to get a street pass. So when I started playing in Brazil, we had to find a place to live and a place to rent.

Okay, what you did in Bahia was fine, but you're going to have to go further, to São Paulo, where a different culture is developing."

What was the first album you made?

I did a lot of studio work on the first album. It was called Éterna. It was a Brazilian sequel to the life of the great poet, Jules Verne. It was a big, big production. I worked for a year and a half on it. The song "Rio de Janeiro" was inspired by my father's hometown, Bahia. It was a very cheap place to live, because you could live very cheaply there. But it was also very dangerous. You had to get a bus to go to school, you had to get a bus to go to work, and you had to get a bus to go back home. I also did the sound for the song "O Secrets Dê é." It's a Brazilian song about an Indian who was kidnapped by a white man. He's in prison, and he's trying to get out. So I did the sound for him.

What was your first big hit?

I did a song called "O Secrets Dê é," about a bandit who was kidnapped by a white man. I wrote the words, and then my bandmates did the music. We made a very good song. The label asked us to do a duet with a Brazilian singer named Aguirre. We did it, and were very proud of it. The next day, the label said, "You've got to do another duet with this singer." So I went to visit her in São Paulo, and she told me, "Listen, I don't like you, and you don't like me." So we ended up doing a duet on her record.

What do you think of the notion that Brazil is the largest country in the world that doesn't have the word "Brazil" in its name?

It's true that Brazil has not received the word "Brazil" in its name, and it's true that Brazil is a very diverse country, with different cultures. But I think that it's the people who make Brazil. Brazil is a country of the people, the people are the most important thing. And that's why Brazil has the national team. The national team is made up of people who represent the country. They don't represent their families, they don't represent their neighborhoods—they represent the people.

You have a lot of Brazilian fans who believe you're an American. Do you think a certain amount of exuberance is part of why Brazilian fans like you?

I think so. I have a lot of Brazilian fans, and I think that's because I'm a rock star in Brazil—I'm the biggest rock performer there is. I think a lot of them have a certain exuberance that makes them like me. So I don't think I have anything to be ashamed of. I think I'm doing what I should be doing. I'm trying to communicate to the world that Brazil is the largest country in the world that doesn't have the word "Brazil" in its name.

What's your take on the Brazilian soccer team?

You know, I really don't know. They play in the world's best league, and they have some of the best players in the world, but they don't play near as well as they should. They've had a lot of good players, but they haven't been able to win many titles. I think that they're going to do better now that they have a new coach, and they're trying to figure out their place in the world.

I think that the best thing about the film is the small details that really make it work. The moment when he puts the camera on the ceiling of the helicopter that he rides is incredible. The fact that he is able to make the car stop is, I think, the most beautiful thing in the film—a moment that I think is unforgettable.

I think that the best scene in the film is the scene where he is walking to the police station with the police officer, and they are both on bicycles. It's a fantastic scene—I think it's one of the best scenes in any movie I've seen. It's so moving—it's a wonderful scene.

I think that the best thing in the film is the segue from the first parts of the film, which are about plagues, and then the second part, which is about the crisis. I think that the crisis is the very first moment in the film, but it's also the very last. The film contains the history of Brazil, but it also goes to the very end of the film. The subject of the film is the crisis of the Brazilian economy, and it's the first crisis that Rodriguez manages to portray in the film.

Once you get to the end, I think you have a complete picture of what's happening in Brazil and a complete picture of what's happening in the world at that time. It shows the globalization of the economy and also the expansion of the economy, of the capitalist system.

I think the best thing is that Rodriguez is able to capture the essence of what's happening in Brazil. He is able to capture the essence of what's happening in Brazil—the crisis, the transformation of the country, the rise of the middle class, the rise of the football culture. I think that Rodriguez also has the ability to portray the power of the culture of

 conditions. Rio de Janeiro, on the other hand, is a completely different reality: it's the paradise—this urban beach, the old capital of colonial Brazil. I'd also like to add a third city to this equation, São Paulo.

In the 1950s, Brazil began to modernize and the car industry was making São Paulo the economic center. In Tropicália, you have these young people from Salvador who went south to Rio and started to see a new Brazil there. Then, during the specific period from 1967 to '69, they came down to São Paulo, where television was starting out and where the car industry was becoming important. So you have the story of people who come down from Bahia to Rio—the place of a smooth, nice life; the place of bossa nova. Then they come down to the neurotic and intense São Paulo.

So I think that Tropicália brings all these different Brazils together, expressing all the contradictions. When they came to São Paulo, they met Os Mutantes, who were pioneers of rock 'n' roll in Brazil, and they were sensible enough to mix with these young rock 'n' roll kids, then to say to us, "

Look at this. This is the new Brazil." This was not the kind of Brazil that we knew. We had the traditional Brazil, the country of violence and poverty and the poor, and the rock 'n' roll Brazil, the country of beauty and the rich.

The answer is that they were both Brazil, but the artificial beauty of the island of Rio de Janeiro is not so artificial in contrast to the real violence and poverty of Brazil's interior, and the reality of the exploitation of the indigenous against the settlers of the lower Amazon. We have to look at both Brazil and in some way we have to look at São Paulo.

Of course, there are other places from which we can get our ideas about Brazil, like Salvador, where we have the story of the first generation of migrants from Brazil who came to work in the Freeport mines. We have the story of the revolutions of the 1960s, São Paulo in particular, where the whole thing began. So it's all over the world.

And this is the kind of thing we must do, and we gotta do it in a way that shows the complexity of the world. One can never say, "This is a one-size-fits-all solution." And that's why the world has to be seen from the point of view of the participants—with the diversity of their experiences and of their ideas and of their needs. And therefore, we don't want to say: "This is the way it is with Brazil." We want to look at it from the point of view of the participants, the perspectives of the people involved.

As you say, it is a view that has become somewhat fashionable in Brazil. How much of this has to do with the fact that the country is in the midst of a recession, and therefore people want to express their anger at the system?

I think it's a combination of different factors. The economic crisis is a reality. We have to be conscious of this and we have to recognize that the economy of Brazil is in a very deep crisis. And it's a crisis that has its causes in the past, in the 1960s and 1970s. But it's also a crisis that is totally unique to Brazil, and that is the crisis of the social state.

In the 1960s and 1970s, when neoliberalism was in its infancy and there was already a tremendous, massive social state, the neoliberal project was born in Brazil. It was born in the context of a state that was very much in the hands of the middle class. The middle class had a very strong voice in the political process, and they were able to shape the direction of the state.

But since the 1980s, when the neoliberal project has taken over, the crisis of the social state has become an absolute truth. The middle class no longer has a very strong voice in politics. And the government has become very much in the hands of the business sector. The business sector, of course, has always had a very strong voice in politics.

A key moment that began this transformation was the 1990s, when the government of the president Fernando Henrique Cardoso was overthrown and a military dictatorship took over. The new government gave up the neoliberal project and began to bring in the social state, and it began to rebuild the social state, not in a neoliberal way, but in a social democratic way, under the leadership of Lula.

But the social state, which had been so violently destroyed by the military dictatorship, was now beginning to be rebuilt. It began to take on the character of a social welfare state. Now it was becoming a well-organized, organized state, with a public health system, with a social security system, with a social

-quoted 1960 letter by Dr. Martin Broszat, translated from the Hamburg weekly Die Zeit under the headline "Keine Vergasung in Dachau" ("No Gassing in Dachau"). It appeared in the German edition of August 19, 1960, and in the US edition of August 26, 1960 (p. 14). Dr. Broszat writes in the name of the prestigious Institute for Contemporary History (Institut für Zeitgeschichte). He later served as director of the Munich-based archive and research center, which is funded by German taxpayers.

Neither in Dachau nor in Bergen-Belsen nor in Buchenwald were Jews or other prisoners gassed. The gas chamber in Dachau was never entirely finished or put "into operation." Hundreds of thousands of prisoners who perished in Dachau and other concentration camps in the Old Reich [that is, Germany in its borders of 1937] were victims, above all, of the catastrophic hygienic and provisioning conditions: according to official SS statistics, during the twelve months from July 1942 through June 1943 alone, 110,812 persons died of disease and hunger in all of the concentration camps of the Reich. The mass extermination of the Jews
==================== COMPLETION 353 ====================
 was by no means the sole cause of this catastrophe. For example, typhus epidemics were also responsible for a significant part of the death-toll.

In fact, as Dr. Broszat points out, when the Germans transferred the prisoners in the Dachau camp to the Buchenwald camp, the former had already been treated for typhus, and the latter for malaria. The camp, which was a typical example of a vast conflagration consisting of several large buildings, was filled with sick and dying people. Until the arrival of the typhus, Dachau had been a "very healthy camp," and there was no reason to suspect that this situation would in any way change. The typhus epidemic, however, devastated the camp. In the Buchenwald camp, the authorities were able to arrange for the treatment of the prisoners whose cases had been diagnosed by medical specialists. A good deal of attention was devoted to the patients, who were allowed to receive their last checkup and to finalize their last requests for permission to die. When the typhus epidemic struck Dachau, the camp authorities had little choice but to make the death requests final.

The medical experts in Buchenwald were able to determine what had happened to the Dachau prisoners. They singled out the following causes of death: (3) pneumonia, (4) typhus, (5) tuberculosis, (6) chronic bronchitis, (7) malnutrition (most of the prisoners were malnourished), and (8) hypothermia (the bodies of those who died were found frozen to death). The typhus had claimed more victims than all the other causes together. The statistics revealed that the camp has never been in such a bad state as in the winter of 1942-43.

After the arrival of the typhus epidemic, the camp was completely abandoned. The bodies of the dead were uncovered and burned. A former SS guard, who had worked in the camp for a long time, told me that all the bodies were burned. This has been confirmed in a report of the former SS chief of police, Dr. Hartmann, who was present in Dachau at the time. The camp was abandoned without a trace.

Dr. Broszat then quotes from the letter of Dr. Szajewska of the institute for historical research, whom he quotes as saying that, "During the German occupation of Poland, the SS and police conducted a systematic program of extermination in the camps of the General Government." Szajewska goes on to say that from January 27 to March 31, 1942, the Germans "liquidated" approximately 2.5 million Jews and other persons of Polish ancestry. According to Szajewska, this was the largest number of victims of "extermination" in the history of the Reich.

In the same letter, Dr. Szajewska refers to the "need for a thorough clearing out" of the camp of Jews and other victims of the Holocaust. The Germans executed the most careful and conscientious "clearing out" of the camp they could. In the last weeks of 1943, the SS and police had withdrawn to a smaller camp in order to free up space for the arrival of the Soviet troops. This camp was called Kovel, and it was abandoned without a trace. Around 50,000 Jews were still held there when the Soviets arrived in January 1944. The SS and police left Kovel at the end of March, and the camp was entirely abandoned.

Dr. Szajewska's statement is well supported by the following documents. On March 20, 1943, the SS sent a memo to the head of the Einsatzsturmführer Werner Naumann in Berlin, who

 in the Eastern European ghettos was not a part of the war effort, of the war against the Soviet Union, or of the war against the German people.

The "gas chambers" in all three camps were designed, constructed, and operated by the SS in the course of its war against the Jews. They were designed and constructed as gassing facilities, and were operated by the SS on orders from the SS leadership. The gas chambers in all three camps were used for the extermination of Jews, and the chain of command was the SS leadership.

That is, the Nazis were not simply employing methods of mass homicide that the German military had used in other areas of the world in the course of the First World War. The Nazis were, in fact, employing methods of mass murder used by the SS in the course of the Second World War.

In Germany, the Allied bombing of Hamburg (July 8, 1943) and of other industrial centers (July, 1944) destroyed the infrastructure of the German war machine in the course of the First World War. The destruction of the German war machine was accompanied by the execution of large numbers of soldiers, officers, and officials by the partisans of the Wehrmacht. During the Second World War, the SS executed tens of thousands of its own soldiers, officers, and civilian officials who had been convicted by a military tribunal for war crimes, or had been sentenced to death.

The Nazi war machine was destroyed in the course of the First World War, while the Holocaust began with the murder of European Jewry after 1933.

The Nazis were not merely using methods of mass homicide that the German military had used in other areas of the world in the course of the First World War. The Nazis were, in fact, employing methods of mass murder used by the SS in the course of the Second World War.

The Nazis and the SS worked together, the Nazis killing Jews by gassing them, the SS killing Jews by exterminating them. The Nazis and the SS were closely linked, the SS acting as a police force of the Nazis and acting on its orders.

The SS was created by the Nazis; it was a paramilitary organization in which Jews were killed by gassing and by extermination. The SS was not a military organization, it was a paramilitary organization in which Jews were killed by gassing and by extermination, and the SS was directly under the command of the Nazis.

 in Dachau was "an absolute fabrication" and a "fraud" (G. von Neurath, The Hoax of the Twentieth Century).

The lead author of the report, editor of the journal Die Zeit, Dr. Böck, who in the 1960s headed the institute for the research of "gas chambers," wrote in a letter to the newspaper Staatszeitung, November 26, 1960: "The report states that the gas chamber was never finished. In my opinion, this is a lie." Dr. Böck was also the editor of Die Zeit in 1960.

The summary of the report by the United State Nuremberg Military Tribunal, which was published in the US edition of August 26, 1960 (p. 24), says: "It has been established that the alleged gas chambers in Dachau were not actually used." The evidence, however, does not stop there. The first American government commission, which examined the evidence of the Holocaust, said in its final report issued in 1957:

"The gas chamber at Dachau was never actually used for the extermination of the Jews (i.e., of the Jews) in any camp of the Third Reich. . . . It is a well-known fact that the alleged gas chambers in Dachau were never used."

In the case of Dachau, the US government commission, the US-Nuremberg Military Tribunal, made a major statement of fact: it was never used.

The infamous "Dr. Mengele Report," which was used as a pretext for the Nuremberg Trials, based on the testimony of Auschwitz doctor Josef Mengele, was in fact based on a fraudulent report written by the notorious Jewish "exterminationist" Dr. Josef Mengele. The "Report" was not even published in a scientific journal. It was written in the name of the infamous Institute for Contemporary History (Institut für Zeitgeschichte). The "Report" was written by Dr. Mengele, who died in 1979, in his capacity as a medical doctor at Auschwitz. The "Report" is a fabrication and a fraud. It was based on the testimony of the "exterminationist" Josef Mengele, who died in 1980.

 had been planned in advance by the chief of the Reich Security Main Office, Adolf Eichmann.

German police officer of the concentration camp at Dachau, Eberhard Röhm, was featured in the movie The Sorrow and the Pity (1953).

Dr. Broszat writes:

The gas chamber at Dachau was never fully finished. It was never put to use. Shaul Eisenfeld, the head of the archive of the Institute for Contemporary History, declared in an interview in 1973 that the gas chamber was never stored properly, and that the roof and walls were not properly sealed. The so-called "gas chamber" was a primitive space, with no ventilation and no lighting. It was a place for sleeping, a place to return to if one was ill, and another place to guard. The so-called "gas chamber" could not be used for killing.

The Berlin-based English edition of the Eichmann trial volume, published in 1982, noted in its introduction that the "gas chamber" in Dachau was "never used for killing and was only used as a place for sleeping, for example, as a place for a prisoner to spend the night in Dachau after death."

The Eichmann trial volume, which was published in German in 1962 and in English in 1992, continues:

The trial record shows that in 1957 the so-called "gas chamber" was converted into a storage room. In 1961 the so-called "gas chamber" was turned into a medical clinic. The so-called gas chamber, which was located in the cellar of a German Army barracks, was never used for killing. It was, in fact, a storage room. The so-called "gas chamber," which was located in the cellar of a German Army barracks, was never used for killing. It was, in fact, a storage room.

The Berlin-based English edition of the Eichmann trial volume continues:

In 1963 an SS engineer, Eberhard Röhm, was brought to trial at Dachau. Röhm, a SS guard, was assigned to the Dachau prison camp on May 7, 1942, for aiding and abetting the murder of Jews. In his deposition he admitted to having participated in the killing of Jews. His statement was recorded. Röhm further testified that the so-called gas chamber was used for killing.

Ludwig Bock, writing for the German edition of August 26, 1960, reports that a German historian and director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's Dachau exhibit, Martin Broszat, "says the so-called gas chamber and crematorium at Dachau was never used for killing." Bock reports that the Eichmann trial volume reveals that the Dachau "gas chamber" was converted to a medical clinic, "and that the so-called gas chamber was not used for killing." Bock reports that Broszat "says the so-called gas chamber was never used for killing, and that the so-called gas chamber was not used for killing."

Dr. Broszat writes:

When the camp commandant, SS-Obergruppenführer Höss, was questioned about the so-called gas chamber in Dachau, he stated that it was never used for killing, because it was not properly built. It was just a place to live in. The so-called gas chamber was a city cellar, which was used for sleeping and for cooking. The so-called gas chamber had no ventilation, and the so-called gas chamber was never used for killing.

Sept 13/09: Flight International's "Closer political ties raise prospects for renewed alliance between Dassault and Embraer" covers the market possibilities.

The 2 firms have very little overlap. Dassault is strong in the high-end executive jet market, but Embraer brackets those offerings with bigger regional jets and lower-end Phenom light and very light jets. Some form of consolidation could make sense. Embraer is also looking to field competition with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A319/320 series, and could benefit from Dassault's engineering expertise. On the flip side, the KC-390 tactical transport would add a new product category for Dassault, improving and eventually replacing the Rafale could take a wider set of resources than France and Dassault are willing to supply, and the closure of the Mirage 2000 line leaves a hole in Dassault's offerings at the light end of the spectrum.

A future E-Jets could fill the gap.

Sept 6/09: Embraer announces that they have signed a deal with Dassault to supply the E-Jets. The contract includes 4 planes.

The E-Jets will be based in the US, and it will be up to Embraer to continue to develop and market the aircraft.

Dassault may look to sell the E-Jets to the Chinese as well.

July 19/09: Embraer Agusta announces that they are looking to sell their Embraer E-Jets to other customers. They will be sold as aircraft-only, with the option to convert to a helicopter in the future.

The E-Jets are not a big seller in the US, and are a big loss maker for the company.

June 27/09: Embraer unveils the E-Jets, a 2 variants of their Q400/Q500/Q600 twin-jet business aircraft. The E-Jets will have a range of over 2,000 miles and will be able to serve a wide range of countries.

July 11/08: Two Embraer E-Jets make their first flight.

June 4/08: Dassault announces that they have won a 4 year, $4.5 billion contract to supply Embraer with the E-Jets. The contract covers E-Jets and E-models of the E-160 Super Tucano and the Mirage 2000/2000N. The deal includes 7 aircraft, which Dassault says will be delivered between 2009 and 2013.

The E-Jets are a mainstay of the French air force and are seen as a competitor to the Boeing 737, Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 MAX.

March 27/08: Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was in Washington, DC, to sign a huge purchase deal with Boeing. Brazil's major defense deal is worth $15 billion and will include the purchase of 2 dozen Boeing HH-60G Pave Hawks to replace Banco do Brasil's aging fleet of 865 Viggen helicopters.

The deal is also expected to include the purchase of 2 dozen Embraer E-Jets. Brazil also signed a contract to purchase 3 C130Js from the US military for use in refueling and cargo transport. Brazil also received a $300 million contract from Israel to purchase 2 E-6B (NATO reporting name: AWACS) planes. Construction of the rest of the E-6B fleet is underway.

December 26/07: Brazil's President Lula da Silva signs a deal with Boeing for the purchase of 2 dozen Embraer E-Jets. The deal is worth $15 billion and includes the purchase of 2 dozen Embraer E-Jets.

The announcement came as Brazil signed a contract for the purchase of 3 C130Js from the US military for use in refueling and cargo transport.

The "Silk Road 2.0" subreddit was created on Monday, and it had a lot of questions about the Silk Road, the infamous internet black market that was shut down in October after a man tried to sell $1 million worth of drugs. It was also a place for discussion about Silk Road 2.0, which was a "shadow" version of the original site called "Silk Road 2.0" that had been shut down in October.

The Reddit shut down, in its entirety, on Wednesday, claiming that the moderators "betrayed the community" and "did not follow our guidelines." The moderators of the subreddit, who have since been sanctioned by the Reddit administration, made a statement explaining the shutdown.

"We have decided to shut down the subreddit as it is no longer relevant, and we are working to make the forums fully functional again," the administrators of the subreddit write. "The community concerns were not addressed, and the community did not receive the content it was expecting. We apologize to the community for any inconvenience."

While it might have been the most interesting question on the Silk Road 2.0 subreddit, it's not the first time that the site has been shut down by the moderators of the site. In November, for instance, it was shut down once again in retaliation for the takedown of the original Silk Road.

The original Silk Road was a marketplace for all things illegal, including drugs, cybercrime, hacking tools, and even child pornography. It was shut down by the FBI in October 2011, and the FBI seized thousands of Bitcoins that were being used to fund the site.

Its successor, Silk Road 2.0, was shut down on Wednesday, and its administrator, Brian Farrell, has promised to return its servers to their original state. It's unclear how much time the site will be down, though.

"[The] Reddit admins have finally realized that they can't shut down anything that they don't understand," Farrell wrote in a statement to Wired. "The new Silk Road will be fully operational in a few days. I'm confident that it will be up and running before then."

Update: The admins of the Silk Road 2.0 subreddit have edited their statement to clarify that the community is not being "betrayed" by the administrators.

 But there are other options, as the article mentions that Norway's Telenor would be interested in the Rafale, while Russia's Tupolev is also a potential competitor. The report also mentions a Brazilian government offer for Embraer's E-Jets at least.

A look at the Dassault/Embraer relationship:

Sept 11/09: Embraer is reportedly looking at the sale of a portion of its 75% stake in the Mirage 2000 to Lufthansa.

See Aviation Week's story.

Sept 8/09: Dassault Signs $2.7 Billion Military Contract with Brazil's Embraer. Dassault will sell the company's Embraer EMB-145 Super Tucano, the first domestically produced light combat aircraft in South America, and build the aircraft at a new plant in the Brazilian state of Para, with the first aircraft scheduled to come off the production line in 2010.

The aircraft will be delivered to Brazil's Air Force by 2010, and will be used for aerial refueling and surveillance missions. The deal is very good news for the Brazilian company, which is currently in the midst of an unpopular state-owned restructuring. It will have to pay a $600 million penalty to the Brazilian government (reportedly in exchange for improving its financial statements), and may have to sell off additional assets to make ends meet. See Aviation Week.

June 20/09: Dassault Aviation signs a $2.8 billion military contract with Brazil's Embraer.

The contract will produce 71 Super Tucanos for the Brazilian Navy, with a total of 2,501 aircraft to be produced over the next 20 years. A 32-hour delivery run of the first aircraft will be conducted in November 2009, with the final delivery to Brazil's Air Force in 2010. The deal, worth up to $1 billion, is for a 30-year basis, with a possible extension.

Dassault Aviation already operates the Embraer EMB-145 Super Tucano from the Brazilian Air Force, and has been the program's prime contractor. Dassault Aviation's Brazilian subsidiary, Embraer SA, also has a 30-year contract with the Brazilian Air Force, for the production of 4,700 Mirage 2000 fighters.

On the other hand, the strategic relationship between Dassault and Embraer could be a solid business for both firms. France and Brazil would have a very strong interest in long-haul transport, and Embraer would be well positioned to sell the Rafale to an increasingly powerful global market. And the two countries would be able to leverage their existing programs to develop and market new products. In any case, the market values of Dassault's and Embraer's jetliners have been trending downward for a while, and the two firms are practically the only ones still producing the Breguet Scenic [and possibly the Embraer Mirage 2000], so the market for these products could not sustain a new alliance.

Sept 13/09: Bombardier and Embraer sign a 10-year "strategic collaboration agreement", which would see Embraer supplying the new CSeries aircraft to Bombardier, while Bombardier would supply the new CSeries-family to Embraer.

The agreement was signed during a visit to the Embraer facility in northern Brazil by the CEO of Bombardier, Alain Bellemare.

The agreement comes with Bombardier's CSeries program in 2016, which is expected to close with a number of orders, including one for an aircraft delivered in 2017. Bombardier and Embraer have been working on the CSeries for over a year, and there are good reasons to believe this deal is not only a win-win for the two firms but also a win-win-win for the regional Brazilian market.

April 24/09: The Brazilian Air Force is working on a $1 billion deal to purchase 12 Rafale fighter jets, which would be delivered for the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) in 2014.

The contract is expected to be worth around $1.4 billion, with the first aircraft delivered in 2014, and the first 36 jets to be delivered in 2013. The FAB was awarded this contract with a competitive tender.

The FAB says that the Rafale is a good platform for Brazilian transport aircraft, and the Brazilian Air Force has been looking for a replacement for the Brazil Air Force's (FAB) fleet of aging Cienfuegos-built Cessna Citation CJ2/CJ3 aircraft.

The Brazilian Air Force has been looking for a replacement for the Brazil Air Force's (FAB) fleet of aging Cienfuegos-built Cessna Citation CJ2/CJ3 aircraft. By 2014, the Brazilian Air Force will have acquired a total of 40 Cessnas.

April 18/09: Dassault Aviation announces a US$2.8 billion contract with Embraer for the supply of 12 Rafale fighter jets. The contract will be worth $1.65 billion with an option for an additional 3 Rafale fighter jets. The deal includes 12 aircraft, of which the first will be delivered to the Brazilian Air Force in 2014.

The contract also includes:

 Development and production of the Rafale aircraft;

 Updates and upgrades to the Dreamliner fleet;

 Training and technical support;

 Deployment support;

 Maintenance and overhaul of aircraft and support equipment;

 Training and certification of personnel;

 Other related services as required; and

 Security and safety support.

. A few curious kids in flip-flops and shorts scurry past.

At times the waves are rough, and the surf is strong. But this is one of the most peaceful stretches of sand on the planet, and everyone everywhere is here to enjoy the liberation of it all.

But it's not just the beach that's enjoying this moment. Across the Australian outback, the world's largest open-air aquarium is preparing to reopen after a three-year, $1.1 billion renovation, a project funded in part by $120 million in federal money.

The aquarium has served as the nation's tourist draw since it opened in 1933, and it's seen a huge increase in visitors since the Great Barrier Reef was declared as an endangered ecosystem in 2005. The aquarium is still the largest open-air aquarium in the world, but it's closed to the public, and is expected to stay closed for years.

"All the [ecosystem] experts have been saying that the reef is in a terrible state and it's much too sensitive to be open," says Barbara Taylor, the president of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) that runs the aquarium.

Taylor says that the reef is in a critical state, and that the aquarium has been a major contributor to the loss of coral reefs around the world. "Without the aquarium, we would not be able to save the reef," Taylor says.

The aquarium's closure is the latest in a series of setbacks for the Great Barrier Reef. Over the past 15 years, more than $2 billion in public money has been diverted to the reef's upkeep. In 2013, Australia's national parks minister introduced legislation to allow the government to seize private land to build a dam on the reef. Critics have argued that the government has no such legal authority.

The reef's decline is a reminder that no one can control the weather and the natural cycles of the world. But the aquarium's closure may have a less tangible impact. "We're talking about a population that's been cut by 90%," says Taylor, "and those are the kind of people who are really interested in sustainable tourism and sustainability."

Taylor notes that the aquarium is not a large tourist draw, so its closure will have a noticeable impact on the local economy. "It's definitely going to have an economic impact," she says. "We'll lose tourism, we'll lose jobs, we'll lose private businesses."

"We're talking about a population that's been cut by 90%."

But Taylor has no regrets. "It's a good thing for the reef. It will bring in money to the reef. It will help the reef."

One hundred years ago, Australian waters were a lot more hospitable. In 1914, the Great Barrier Reef was just a glint in the distance.

The reef was an ideal place for scientists to study coral reefs for the first time. It was the first place in the world where scientists could observe the diverse range of life on the reef, including sharks, sea turtles, and dugongs.

In 1914, the reef sprawled out in all directions. Scientists could see the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. But the reef sprawled out over a much bigger area than it does today.

"It is the largest, the most biologically diverse, the most biologically diverse place on Earth," says Matthew D'Arcy, professor in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Queensland.

. In one of the most striking examples of the body's deep, aging clock, a little boy plays near a cluster of surfboards, his mother taking a knee and placing her hand over his head.

I've come here to meet Blackburn, who is a two-time Olympian and a two-time world champion in her sport, and is often considered the world's top female competitive swimmer. But she's wearing an aqua top and shorts, a patterned dress, and sunglasses.

Her hair is pinned up in a ponytail and she's wearing a necklace with a black gold ring. Her face is shadowed by a dot of mascara. It's a warm morning in the middle of the Australian summer.

Blackburn, 38, is the first to admit that her body may not be in peak condition. She has a fairly average build, with a torso that is slightly smaller than it was when she won the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and a hip measurement that is roughly the same dimension as it was when she was in her mid-20s. Her hips are wider and her shoulders are narrower. Her face has the softness of the best-preserved set of teenage skin.

But Blackburn says she has never given much thought to the way her body's physical appearance affects how she feels. "I don't really think about it," she says. "I don't think about my body. I'm really good at keeping my mind in the right place."

Up to this point, she's been sticking to that script, but it's threatened to break. After finishing her last national championship in 2015, Blackburn was awarded the Commonwealth Games medal of honour. The ceremony took place in Sydney's Olympic Stadium, and the crowd's roar was to be heard for miles around.

"I'm here to celebrate and I'm here to win," Blackburn said. "I'm here to stand on the podium with my hand out."

She makes a long, deliberate gesture with her hand, and then turns back to the microphone. "In the next few minutes I will give a talk about the importance of having a good attitude," she says. "I will begin by saying that you need to be positive and positive! I'm not saying that you have to be a cheerleader or that you have to be happy all the time. I'm just saying that you have to keep your mind on the positives and you have to keep your feet on the ground."

She turns and stares at the crowd. "I am here to talk about my attitude," she says. "My attitude and my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude. The whole damn time. I'm going to talk about my attitude plus my attitude and my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude plus my attitude.

Then, suddenly, a whisper of something big.

"Whoa!"

A large wave crashes onto the beach. It's huge. It's bigger than any black wave before. It's the size of a school bus and it crashes into the beach and the pelicans and the joggers and the surfers and the surfers and the surfers.

The wave hits the water like a boulder, ripples spreading out from its impact. It's the kind of wave that can break a surfboard and send a surfer to the bottom of the ocean. It's also the kind of wave that burns your face.

"It's the largest I've ever seen," Blackburn says, staring at the photographed wave. "It's a pinkish-white color. The wave is the size of a normal wave. It's not a big wave. It's a pinkish-white wave."

It's not just a wave, it's a wave that's had its telomeres shredded.

"It's a massive event," Blackburn says. "It's like hundreds of people all of a sudden got together and said, 'We need to get this guy to the hospital.'"

In the early '90s, when the idea of telomeres gained traction, the idea of telomere damage was almost completely forgotten. Then, in 2002, a researcher named Steve Stamets—who had done pioneering work on telomerase and telomerase activators—published a paper in Science that heralded the return of the idea. Of the roughly 100 people who read the paper, Blackburn estimates that, on average, less than a third reached the end of the article. When the paper came out, there was a palpable sense of relief among the scientists and the public. The telomeres-aging debate was over.

But since then, the debate has become even more heated. It has exploded into the public consciousness, journalistically speaking, and in the last decade, the debate has stretched from the medical to the political. It has pushed scientists to publish more and more papers. It has brought telomere research back into the mainstream, and given it an added urgency.

The scientific debate on telomeres has become more heated as the number of papers published on the topic has exploded.

After the publication of Stamets' Science paper, a flurry of interest arose among scientists and the public alike. In 2003 alone, a total of 136 papers were published on telomeres, according to a blog called Science Exchange. In 2012, that number was up to 406. This past year, it was up to 656.

The story of how telomere research exploded into the public consciousness can be traced to the 1990s, when, as Blackburn puts it, "there was a kind of neo-Darwinian movement, where biology was taking over from physics."

During the 1990s, a group of researchers who were interested in the effects of environmental factors on aging began to publish their work. They did this by taking the basic workings of cellular biology and applying them to the effects of specific environmental factors. People began to pay attention to the epigenome, the chemical tags on DNA that are turned on and off with each cell division. What people found was that, in some cases, these epigenetic marks—which are passed down from parent to child—caused the aging process to accelerate. After a generation or two, you were much older than you were when you were born.

 longer. "It's lovely," she says. "No one has ever seen that."

In the decade since Blackburn and Epel's original study, the idea that stress ages us by eroding our telomeres has also permeated popular culture. In addition to Blackburn's many scientific accolades, she was named one of Time magazine's "100 most influential people in the world" in 2007, and received a Good Housekeepingachievement award in 2011. A workaholic character played by Cameron Diaz even described the concept in the 2006 Hollywood film The Holiday. "It resonates," says Blackburn.

But as evidence of the damage caused by dwindling telomeres piles up, she is embarking on a new question: how to protect them.

At first, the beach seems busy. Waves splash and splash and splash. Sanderlings wheel along the shoreline. Joggers and dog walkers amble across, while groups of pelicans hang out on the water before taking wing or floating out of sight. A surfer, silhouetted black against the sky, bobs about for 20 minutes or so, catching the odd ripple towards shore

.

But soon it's over. The beach is quiet, and the waves have subsided, leaving the sand smooth and white. The pelicans have taken to the waves and left, the surfers to the sand.

Later, on the patio of a nearby hotel, the conversation turns to the beach, and what it says about our health. Is it the place where we get our salt and our brine, where we come to relax? Is it where we have our babies? Is it where we die?

The conversation turns to the beach. Is it the place where we get our salt and our brine, where we come to relax? Is it where we have our babies? Is it where we die?

"I've always wondered," says Blackburn, who lives in a small house in the far north of Italy. "It's a place where we go to relax, to think, to watch the sunset. Why should we be worried about that?"

When she moved to Milan in 1990, Blackburn's father, a Londoner and former underground baker, had just retired from a career at Rolls-Royce. His wife had taken an early retirement from her job at a state-owned bank. So Blackburn joined the family business, buying and selling Italian coffee at the local café. Her father, who always spoke about his work as "life-changing," had proposed a project: a beach in the residential area of Calabria.

"It was a bit of a toss-up between his two gardens," she says. "I was looking for a more suburban experience." She chose the one in the shadow of the town's cathedral, overlooking the sea.

Over the next few years, Blackburn's father, who had already built a house in the local centre, built his own island. He installed sand dunes, built a beach hut, and hired a few Italian professors to teach schoolchildren how to build a sand castle. Blackburn estimates that she spent a few hundred hours on the project.

"People were fascinated by it," she says. "It was a bit of a tourist attraction."

In the early 1990s, though, the project was plagued by problems. People complained that the sand was too "red," and it was, though not quite as bad as the red sand found in the south of France, which is considered a "second-rate red" by the British Association of Sand and Gravel. More seriously, the area's water level rose. People had to wait until the water level dropped before digging out their dunes. And the project started costing a fortune.

"The cost of putting up the dunes was astronomical," Blackburn says. "People started to get worried."

She began to wonder about the idea of a beach. She thought that maybe the architects had built the dunes too high. Maybe the sand, which is quite porous, started to break down. There was also an environmental trend. A newly-elected mayor was establishing a beach on the mainland, in the neighbouring town of Nettuno.

"He could not have been doing that on a beach," says Blackburn. "He was setting up a beach on the mainland to attract tourists. So I said, 'Well, what if we did this on the beach in Calabria?'"

Blackburn, who has long been interested in the health effects of the environment, decided to study the effects of the beach in Calabria. She and her colleagues at the University of Bologna designed an experiment to see if sand dunes could be maintained in the face of higher water levels and growing population.

"Jesse is pretty much an established United player," McGuinness tells Sky Sports. "You wouldn't call him a youngster now.

He's one of the older heads now and is looking after Marcus Rashford and looking after the others.

"That's one of the things we did at United. We'd have 12-year-olds training with 18-year-olds every Monday with a big game in a cage. He'd be a part of that with Paul Pogba and all of the others. It was in effect a big street football game. But the fact that they were all mixing together meant that they became a big band of brothers.

"Everyone was doing their own thing, and they all had each other's backs. They were all really close. Jesse Lingard is very humble and very humble to the point where he'll always be one of the most humble blokes I've met in football. He's a great guy to look after and he's probably been the biggest influence on my career. He's a massive influence on the other players. He's a really good boy."

The parallels between Lingard and his fellow academy graduates are obvious. They are all very impressive footballers who have made an immediate impact at Old Trafford, and they were all born just a few miles away from the club's Carrington training ground.

Jesse Lingard is one of the biggest influences on the other players at United

McGuinness, who left United in 2013 after a 29-year association, believes that Lingard has already benefited from the academy's years of work. "He's the most advanced of the group," he says. "He's got better every year. He's still got some way to go but he's got a lot of potential. He's an excellent footballer. He's very intelligent. He can play wide or in a central position. He's got a great left foot."

That left foot has been a consistent feature of United's academy system. In the first 12 months of this season, Lingard has been involved in five goals for the Under-18s, and two for the Under-19s.

The United youth set-up is certainly renowned for its emphasis on right-footed penetrations, but it has been a steady stream of quality attacking players have come through the ranks over the last decade or so.

In the years before Moyes arrived, the club was full of left-footed players, but at the time, the club's hierarchy was keen to establish a side which was predominantly right-footed as well.

On the left wing, Nani was a regular in the first team. From the left, Rafael was an ever-present. And on the right wing, the likes of Nani, Rafael, Javier Hernandez and Nani all had significant playing time.

Now, the likes of Lingard, Pogba and Rashford have started to flourish in the same position, and it is this generation of players which McGuinness believes has benefited United.

"One of the reasons we've been so successful is because we've had players coming through the academy that are right-footed," McGuinness says. "We've had Nani, Rafael, Nani, Rafael and Nani. All these players are right-footed.

"Now, we've got the likes of Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard who are left footed, because we've had players coming through over the last 10 years who are right-footed.

"The fact that we've had players who are right-footed coming through and have been successful is a real credit to the academy. But the fact of the matter is, we've got a young team, and that means that sometimes you've got to give a player a chance. If you give them a really good opportunity then you would say that's the best way to go."

To date, Lingard has been given a chance to shine at United, and McGuinness believes that the 22-year-old has done so with distinction.

"Jesse is the perfect example of that. He's one of those guys that if you can't trust him, then you shouldn't be at the football club. He's got a great record and he's got a good relationship with all of the lads that have come through.

"He's an extremely good leader at the club and he's very much a United player. He's a good guy and I think that's the most important thing that the youth system does. They're helping the players to get better and to grow and become better people."

Ferguson was under pressure to reinvigorate United's youth system after the departures of David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes in the summer of 2013.

Jesse Lingard has been making waves since joining United from Derby

Lingard's arrival sparked a flurry of activity from United's youth ranks following David de Gea's £30m move to Real Madrid and Spain international Sergio Ramos's £20m move from Real Sociedad.

Lingard helped United win the FA Youth Cup in 2013 and was handed his first senior start against Manchester City at Old Trafford just four days later. He scored in the 2-0 win and has been a regular starter since.

United's dominance of the League One title in the last few seasons has made them a wealthy club but McGuinness insists the club's academy has been a key factor in their success.

McGuinness says his role is to "build bridges" between all the different age groups

"We spend a lot of time in the academy working with the other age groups," he says. "We spend a lot of time with the under-16s. And we've got a group of 14-year-olds that are coming through that are in the Under-18s.

"We've got a group of over-16s that play for the Under-19s. We've got a group of 13-14s that play for the Under-17s. We've got a group of 11-12s that play for the Under-16s.

Lingard celebrates his goal for United in the FA Youth Cup final against Arsenal

"We spend a lot of time with those age groups because we want to build bridges. It's not just about players coming through. It's about how they interact with the other age groups, how they relate to the younger players and how we build that family atmosphere in the academy.

"We work with the other age groups on a daily basis. It's not just about players coming through. We work with the under-16s, we work with the under-15s, we work with the under-14s, we work with the under-13s, we work with the under-12s. We build bridges with every age group.

"We're trying to create the best environment for players from every age group. It's a beautiful thing. The academy is a great place to be at. The players are incredibly happy and we're happy with that.

Jesse Lingard is a key part of United's plans next season

"What we've got here is a group of players that's the same age as the rest of them. You've got the same experience and the same passion for the game. And I think that's where the best part of our academy is. That's what I love about the academy, is our diversity."

Lingard is one of many players who have been helping to develop their own skills since joining United.

"Jesse has been a big part of that. He's started off as an 18-year-old and he's been a part of the United side for three years. He's now been a senior regular in the first team, so he's obviously developed as a player."

McGuinness is a football lifer and it is the way he has seen he has been able to influence Lingard that has impressed him. He says: "I know Jesse as a highly-rated young player. He is the sort of player who has a really good football IQ, knows the game well. He's a player who is still learning and I think it's done a lot to his confidence.

"It's inspirational for Jesse because he's a brilliant footballer. I think Manchester United will be the first club where he's really given the chance to play regularly. I think he's a great example for all the youngsters at the club. I don't think there is any way that Jesse will be a United player for ever but if he continues to develop and plays for the club for the next few years, I think he's going to be something special."

Lingard has been a big part of the United side since his debut for the Under-16s in October 2015, making 40 appearances in all competitions. He was also part of the team that won the FA Youth Cup in 2011 and says it was a huge moment for him to represent the club.

"It was the biggest moment of my career," Lingard said. "It was a massive night for me. It was a big night for us to win the FA Youth Cup. It was an amazing night and I was really lucky to be involved.

"It was a great night for me and a great night for every club I've played in that I've been associated with and played for. It was a great night for the academy and the Under-18s. We put on a fantastic show and it was a great night for the club."

The FA Youth Cup has been a great success for United and Lingard has been a big part of achieving that success. He says: "I've been very lucky to be part of it. It's been a pretty special experience.

"It's a fantastic competition. I've been part of it for the last two years and I've been involved in a lot of big games. It's something to be proud of and hopefully it'll continue for a long time."

"They were all supporting each other. They were all fighting for the same position. The fact that they were all fighting for the same position meant that they were a big band of brothers. It was the same in the academy. They were all looking for each other's position. They were all fighting for the same position and they became a big band of brothers."

McGuinness, who was United's director of football from 2006 until 2010, was instrumental in the formation of the academy. In his second spell as the club's chief scout, he brought in so many academy products that he was put in charge of the Deans' academy.

The ties between the club and academy, however, have not always been as strong. The players have often been passed over by the club's coaching staff. The likes of Ryan Giggs, Ryan Giggs's older brother, and Darren Fletcher, the young centre-back who played for United's Under-20s, have had the opportunity to go to other clubs to progress their careers, but Lingard and Rashford are the exceptions.

Jesse Lingard scored the winning goal in the FA Youth Cup final against Sunderland

As Rashford will testify, the lack of opportunities has not always been a problem. And while Lingard admits that he is "still learning about football," the striker says that he has been able to seize opportunities when he has been given them.

"I think that's good to have a guy like me to come through the ranks," Lingard says. "When I was younger there were a lot of players like me. That's how it is at United. I've been involved in games where I've been left out. One of the things I've learned is that you can't try to be too big for your boots. I've been given opportunities there. That was an eye-opener for me.

"I've always been a goal-getter, so it's always going to be a challenge for me. I think that's good. I've just got to take it one game at a time. I've got to keep working hard and keep improving and score goals."

Rashford, 19, has settled into life at United, but Lingard is looking to take his career even further. He has also been encouraged by the likes of United's academy coach Paul McGuinness

Lingard says that he hopes to one day become a manager. He has already been offered the position at Derby County, where he will train alongside former United youth-team coach Steve McClaren.

"I would definitely like to be a manager one day," Lingard says. "I'm a player who loves to play football. I think that's the best way to get your career going. If it's not for me to be a manager, I want to be a manager somewhere where I can help the young players that I see in the game.

"I've got a lot of friends in the game. I've got a lot of people who are playing and I'm supporting them. But I want to be a manager. I'm not going to stop doing that until I do get the opportunity."

Danny Welbeck, 23, has also been offered a chance at Derby County after impressively impressing for the first team at Manchester United.

In the meantime, Lingard has got involved with the Under-21s and is hoping to be involved with the first team in the future.

"Hopefully, I'll be part of the first team next year," he says. "I'm working hard every single day. I'm loving every

On Wednesday, the hospital said it was "taking appropriate action" in response to the death.

State leaders, including Gov. Rick Snyder, expressed condolences to Delvecchio's family.

"This is a terrible tragedy and we are working closely with the University of Michigan Health System to respond to this situation," Snyder said in a statement.

"Her loss is a tragedy for her family, the University of Michigan Health System and the entire community. I offer my condolences to her family and loved ones and ask that you keep them in your thoughts and prayers."

University of Michigan Health System President David DeGioia said the university is committed to a safe environment for all employees, staff and patients.

"Our thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies go out to the family of Ms. Delvecchio and her colleagues, colleagues, patients and their families," DeGioia said.

"We have established a drug and alcohol team to provide support to our employees, staff and patients, and we have reinforced our zero tolerance policy for those employees who can demonstrate a current or recurring pattern of substance abuse.

But it's true: There is a highly addictive substance called "cocaine" that is legal in the United States, and it can be purchased over the counter.

First, a little background. Cocaine is a psychoactive drug that contains an ingredient called ephedrine. It's often used as a stimulant for people who are trying to stay awake and alert. Like many stimulants, it's also a diuretic, meaning it alters the body's water balance.

It's a drug that's been around for decades. In the 1920s, there was an epidemic of cocaine abuse, and the United States banned the drug outright in the late 1930s. Some people still use it, though, as a "club drug" because it's cheap and readily available.

Cocaine's popularity today is due to the fact that it's become a very popular recreational drug. It's easy to get, and much cheaper than other over-the-counter sedatives. (The cost of a single gram of pure cocaine is around $10, while a single dose of oxycodone is more than $100.)

The fact that it's cheap and easy to get, however, doesn't make it a good drug. Cocaine is a stimulant that's highly addictive.

In a study in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, researchers found that cocaine addiction is 100 times more common than people think. And it's even more dangerous for the people who are addicted.

Researchers examined the medical records of 2,254 people who sought treatment for cocaine addiction between 1999 and 2007. They found that about 20 percent of the people who sought treatment for cocaine addiction also had a major depressive disorder.

The researchers also found that people who were addicted to cocaine were three times more likely to seek treatment for depression.

It's important to note that this is only a study, and the researchers note that they don't know the exact numbers for people who use cocaine recreationally.

All of this makes cocaine a dangerous drug. And it makes it very easy to get. It's also highly addictive.

It's even worse than alcohol

Cocaine addiction is a serious problem, and we need to do more to help people stop using it. In the United States, though, it's perfectly legal to purchase cocaine over the counter.

For a recent study in the Journal of Addictive Diseases, researchers interviewed people who were addicted to cocaine. They found that about half of the people who used cocaine also reported that they obtained it from friends or family.

 patient found with Delvecchio.

Police also said she had checked out both fentanyl and midazolam throughout her shift and that the medications were frequently used in her wing of the hospital.

Delvecchio was a nurse in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit, according to her obituary. She was found dead around 9:15 a.m. Dec. 6 in a locked bathroom at the Neuroscience Hospital, the former location of the old Mott Hospital, located at 1500 East Medical Center Drive in Ann Arbor.

The manner of death was ruled "apparently accidental," according to the autopsy report.

According to the autopsy, a syringe was also found in the bathroom and there were multiple needle marks on various parts of the body.

"Ms. Delvecchio's death was truly tragic and underscores the need for us to identify those who may be abusing drugs or alcohol and offer rehabilitation support as appropriate," Michael Steigmeyer, a spokesman for the University of Michigan Health System, wrote in an email to The Ann Arbor News.

Using any drugs is a violation of the health system's policies.

"Any staff member who is working while impaired or misusing substances not only violates the university's policy
==================== COMPLETION 379 ====================
, but may also jeopardize the health and safety of patients," Steigmeyer said.

The university suspended Delvecchio for 30 days without pay in January, according to university spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald. A subsequent internal investigation determined Delvecchio violated university policies and was disciplined, Fitzgerald said.

The Michigan State Police are still investigating Delvecchio's death.

The Ann Arbor Police Department said they do not believe the death is related to her employment.

"We do not believe this was a drug overdose at this time," Ann Arbor police Maj. Christopher Covelli told The Ann Arbor News.

Covelli said police are not aware of any evidence indicating Delvecchio was using drugs or drinking alcohol during her shift.

"We do not have any information that there was any relationship between the death and drugs or alcohol," Covelli said.

The Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office is assisting with the investigation.

But for many, the idea of a portable Vita is a strange one to consider.

While the Vita is capable of playing a wide variety of games, the hardware, while not the best, is still capable of holding its own and still keeping games running smoothly. But for many, the idea of a portable Vita is either laughable or a strange one to consider.

And for many, the PS Vita is a bit of a strange platform to even consider.

But that's not to say there aren't a few good reasons to consider a Vita.

The Vita Is a Very Good Game Machine

The Sony PlayStation Vita is not a console that you have to focus on much. It can play just about any game you'd want to play. Many games are natively available on the PS Vita, but many of them are only playable on the Vita because of the Vita's remote play capabilities.

In short, the Vita is a great game machine.

The Vita Does Not Require a Lot of Removing

The thing about the Vita is that it is a handheld console, so it doesn't require a lot of moving around to play games on it. There are a few exceptions, of course, but for the most part, the Vita doesn't require much to be removed for a game to be played.

17. NARENDRA MODI'S GUJARAT STATE GOVERNMENT PROSECUTES SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS WHO EXPOSED MODI'S INVOLVEMENT IN GUJARAT RIOTS

Modi's state government has retaliated against multiple senior police officers who attempted to expose the conspiracy and cover-up.

(a) For example, when an officer collected phone records proving that rioters were in direct contact with politicians and the police, and he gave the evidence to one of the commissions investigating the riots, Modi's government prosecuted him under the Official Secrets Act.

(b) Another officer, the deputy commissioner of internal security in the State Intelligence Bureau, was present

 at a meeting in the Chief Minister's office on the night of the riots where the details of the conspiracy were discussed. He was removed from duty, even though he was not the sole source of information.

(c) Rajat Sharma, the Special Commissioner of Police in Gujarat for the riots, and in charge of the investigation, was suspended by Modi's government for allegedly mishandling evidence. He was arrested on 25th August, 2015 and charged with six counts of criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct. The state government's attempt to prosecute him for his alleged crime is not supported by any evidence.

(d) The Special Investigation Team, which was set up to investigate the riots, was also formed in order to investigate possible irregularities in the probe conducted by the state government. Its members were removed by the State government.

(e) In March 2015, Amit Shah, the Gujarat Chief Minister, requested the Supreme Court to have the State Police investigate the role of the police in the riots. The court rejected this request.

18. SIT COMMISSION APPOINTED BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT IS AN OBJECTIVE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT

The State government has appointed a seven-member SIT, headed by a retired high court judge, to investigate the case of the riots in Ahmedabad. It is a mere "stakeholder" committee. It includes representatives of the Gujarat government, the RSS, the BJP, the Congress and various NGOs.

The SIT has also been given a mandate to found out the truth about the role played by the police and the political leaders in the riots and the circumstances on the night of the riots.

19. SIT COMMISSION REPORT WAS RELEASED AFTER A FEW MONTHS<|endoftext|>A man who has been convicted of raping a disabled girl in her own home after she was left there by her parents has been jailed for five years.

Benedict Bailon, 27, originally of Kentish Town, pleaded guilty to raping the girl after he found her lying in a pool of blood and lying on a sofa in January last year.

The court heard that Bailon was a guest at the girl's home in Chelsea, east London, and forced his way into the house in an attempt to rape the girl.

He was arrested after a neighbour reported hearing assault imminently, and a manhunt was launched to find him.

Bailon was charged with two counts of rape and two counts of assault by penetration but was found guilty at the Old Bailey of raping the girl on January 18 last year at the victim's home in Chelsea, east London.

The court heard Bailon had appeared in court on the same day as the girl to face a charge of rape, but it was decided to put the two charges together to try and reduce the sentence.

He was initially found guilty of the rape and assault charges.

The court heard the girl, now 12, was left in her own home by her parents after she was found crying and injured at the bottom of a staircase by a neighbour.

The court was told that Bailon forced his way into the house and forced his way into the girl's family home where he raped her.

The girl was then locked in her bedroom for a further three days while Bailon made his move on her.

The girl was left in a pool of blood covering the sofa and Bailon poured petrol over her and set fire to the room.

After he escaped, Bailon left the house and went to a nearby park where he threw petrol bombs at a rubbish bin and set it alight.

He then returned to the girl

(c) The State Intelligence Director, who had been tasked by the Modi government to investigate the riots, was transferred after he exposed the police involvement in the riots.

(d) The investigation into the riots by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been conducted in a very biased manner. The CBI, in its report, made reference to evidence provided by the Gujarat Police, which was never mentioned in the C.I.A. report.

18. VILLAGERS' LOP-STRETCHING AND THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES

All of the major incidents of violence in Gujarat took place under a government with the BJP as the principal opposition party. The state government was only in power for a little over two years. During this period, the state government did nothing to stop rioters from looting and killing.

This state of affairs was brought to the fore when the Gujarat riots took place. The Modi government did nothing to stop the looting and killings. The Gujarat riots took place in the context of a state government with the BJP as a principal opposition party, which allowed the riots to continue despite repeated warnings from the state administration.

The riots were a direct result of the Modi government's abysmal track record in implementing the most basic rights of citizens. The state government did nothing to stop the police from participating in the riots and the people did nothing to tell the police that they were being looted and killed.

The Gujarat riots were not a spontaneous outburst of people's anger and frustration at the Congress and Narendra Modi. Instead, it was a calculated attempt by the government to destroy the social fabric of the country.

19. THE GOVERNMENT'S CRIMINAL PROBLEMS AND ITS UNFAIR AND UNJUST PROPAGANDA

The Gujarat riots have exposed the Modi government's criminal and unfair policies in dealing with the victims of the riots.

The Gujarat government has also exposed its own criminal record by allowing the rioters to loot and kill the victims' families.

(a) The Gujarat government allowed the looting of the homes of the victims of the riots. The homes of the victims were looted and burnt, in violation of a Supreme Court order. The Gujarat government also failed to take action against the corrupt policemen who were involved in looting and burning the victims' homes.

(b) The Gujarat government also failed to take action against the officials of the local police who were involved in the looting and burning of the victims' homes.

(c) The Gujarat government has also failed to take effective action against the corrupt officials of the Central government who were involved in the looting and burning of the victims' homes.

20. THE GOVERNMENT'S FAIR AND JUST PROPAGANDA

The Gujarat government has repeatedly claimed that the Gujarat riots were a "mistake" and that it "did not have any role in the riots."

The Modi government has claimed that the Gujarat riots were an "isolated incident" and that it was not responsible for the deaths and destruction.

The Modi government has also claimed that it has "no role in the riots" and that it has "no information about the role of any of my officials in the riots."

The Gujarat government has claimed that it is "not responsible" for the riots and that it "does not have any knowledge about the role of any of my officials in the riots."

18. MODI'S STATE GOVERNMENT PROSECUTES FORMER GUJARAT POLICE OFFICER FOR RELEASING DOCUMENTS REVEALING HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE RIOTS

Modi's state government also prosecuted former police officer Devesh Chandra Pandey for releasing documents showing his involvement in the riots. Pandey has been serving as a Deputy Commissioner of Police in the state since 2013. He was also the state's chief investigating officer on the riots.

DGP Pandey had been deputed by the previous BJP government to head the special investigation team, but he was transferred to the state police headquarters (SPH) in May 2015 when he was the head of the investigating team. It was only in September 2015 that Pandey was transferred to the SPH, and was investigating the riots.

On 21 September 2015, Pandey submitted a report to the state government, after which he was transferred to the SPH. He was placed under suspension on 15 October 2015 after he refused to provide an 'explanation' for the transfer and the suspension.

On 21 October 2015, Pandey submitted a letter to the state government, stating that the transfer was the result of "interference by the previous government". He also stated that he would not cooperate in any investigations carried out by the SPH against the previous government or the BJP.

On 22 October 2015, the state government and the BJP filed a criminal defamation case against Pandey for making the allegations.

After Pandey was suspended, he was arrested on 27 October 2015 for "having committed the offence of not disclosing a material fact".

On 28 October 2015, the state government filed a criminal defamation case against him for "making false and malicious allegations against the state government".

On 9 November 2015, the state government filed a criminal defamation case against him for making defamatory allegations against the state government.

"But she is ridiculous," Ron replied dolefully, poking his daemon with his shoe.

In the end, she was content with her daemon. They were a good fit, a good fit with her other daemon and a good fit with her friends. But she was a Gryffindor, and it was her destiny to rule the school. That meant that she had to be the one in charge of the daemon.

And that meant she had to have her own cat.

Are you nagging me, Ron?

It was a calm summer day outside Uagadou, a peaceful afternoon in a park. It was peaceful because Uagadou was a quiet town, quiet because it was quiet. The green grass was just beginning to show its first hints of summer, beginning to show its first hints of green.

The park was quiet because it was a quiet park. There was no noise, no children playing, no music playing, no chatter.

It was quiet because it was a quiet day.

There was a cat in the park.

She was a cat, and she was a daemon.

She pouted at her da, who was still in her desk chair, ignoring her. She would have liked to go and protest to Dumbledore, but the da was in his own world, and frankly she was bored with it.

And then, just as she was about to grab for a floo powder or a proper laptop, she noticed a pair of red eyes looking at her.

"Hello," said the red eyed, raven haired witch. "Why the long face?"

"I have just come from the library," Hermione replied. "I've got a great book here on spellcraft and magic that I'm dying to read. It seems to be an ancient text, written in an ancient language."

The red eyed witch quirked an eyebrow. "Perhaps you should visit the Hogwarts library first. I imagine it is quite well stocked. I've been there many times, and they have several very nice books about ancient magical culture and spells. I am quite sure you would find it of interest."

Hermione turned to him, but didn't meet his eyes. "It is," she agreed, "but…"

"Then what was it?" the witch asked, one of the most concerned looks she'd ever seen where her eyes went to his.

"I have just been reading some old books that are covered by copyright and they relate to ancient magical spells. I have a feeling that I'll be able to find them in the library. I'll be right back."

The witch seemed to consider this for a moment, then shot a look at Hermione who was already back in the library. "If you would be so kind as to return to my office, I would be happy to show you."

"Of course, Ma'am," Hermione agreed obediently. She walked away, and with her da's help, returned to the library.

"Well, it seems I was right," she said as she opened a long tome and began to read.

She was almost at the end of the book when she heard a knock on her door. She sat up straight and turned to see her da standing there.

"I'm back," Hermione said.

"I said I was coming back," the red eyed witch replied. She took a few steps towards her, all the while muttering under her breath, "I can't believe I'm actually going to be giving you a book on spellcraft."

"I'm not surprised," Hermione replied. "I was just reading some old tomes. I read it yesterday, and I thought it was interesting. I was thinking of getting you a copy of the book."

"Well, I'll have to see if I can find it for you," the witch said. "I remember they don't sell it very often."

"I'll give you the book, if you'll let me borrow it. I could use some entertainment," Hermione replied, grinning. She gave her da a quick kiss before she moved on, but she knew that the red eyed witch would attack her.

She found the book, and when she reached the back of the book was surprised to find there were several pages missing. The pages were crumpled and crumpled. She looked again and it was gone.

"Oh no," she cried out. "I'm so sorry. I had forgotten it was so expensive."

"Oh, it's nothing," the red eyed witch said. "You're just lucky that you weren't looking at a book on Potter's rituals and spells," she added, pointing at one of the pages, "or you might have done some damage."

And it was. She was, from that moment on, Hermione Granger with the cat daemon.

She couldn't be happier.

"You know," Ron said later while sitting in the Leaky Cauldron waiting for Harry to come down from his room. Out the corner of her eye, a moving poster of Sirius Black sneered at her. Crookshanks hissed at the poster, amber eyes glittering. "I don't actually think your ridiculous cat is all cat. It's gotta be part kneazle or something."

"Don't be stupid, Ron," she snapped, turning her back on the poster. Another thing to worry about. "And don't call him ridiculous. I don't tell Pig she's ridiculous."

"But she is ridiculous," Ron replied dolefully, poking his daemon with his shoe. Pig squeaked in protest, flickering from a toad to a badger and finally turning into a fluttering owl that clipped Ron's ear with her wing as she sought shelter in the rafters above their heads. "But at least she's not a mad cat

 lady."

"Pig's not mad," Hermione corrected, grinning. "You know, Ron, you've got to think about the things you say. It's not fair to her."

"How would you know?" Ron asked, his face as red as a tomato.

"I've known her long enough to know that she's not mad and I'm not gonna interrupt her," Hermione replied, rolling her eyes. "I'm really glad you're not mad, because I think she'd just rip you limb from limb."

"It's not like that," Ron protested, stepping toward her. "She's just—"

"I don't wanna hear it," Hermione interrupted. "I'd kill you if you did that. You know that."

"Oh, I'm so sorry," he murmured, his cheeks burning. "I didn't mean it like that. I know you'd kill me if I said something like that."

"Well, you're not gonna tell her then," she replied, grinning. "You don't think it'd be a good idea to be out of the house all the time?"

"No, I don't think it would be fair to her if I did," Ron admitted, shaking his head. "I'm just saying, I don't think it would be fair to her to be out all the time. I mean, I'm not saying it's because I hate her, but—"

"You hate her, right?" Hermione smirked. "So why not just wait until she's here and then tell her?"

"Well, she's never here," Ron pointed out.

"Right," Hermione agreed, leaning forward to press a kiss to Ron's forehead. "Well, I'm glad that you're not mad at her."

"I am mad at her," Ron protested. "What I said was that it wouldn't be fair to her to be out all the time. But it's not like—"

"So you don't think it would be fair to her to be the only one out?" Hermione asked. "Oh, I'm sure you'll tell me if you think that's unfair or anything. But I'm not gonna be mad at you. I've got no plans to kill you, and I don't think you'd want me to. I'm just glad you aren't mad at her."

"Alright then," Ron sighed, grinning. "Alright then. Anyway, so, what's up?"

"What's up?" Hermione laughed. "I've been meaning to say that I'm really glad that you're not mad at her."

"Granger!" Ron exclaimed. "I'm not mad at her!"

"Of course you're not," Hermione scoffed. "I know you don't. Besides, if you were mad, you'd just leave, right?"

"No, because I love her," Ron insisted, grinning.

"I don't think you do," Hermione replied, walking over to the window to peer out. "I mean, I'm sure you'd love her, but I think you're just mad at her for being different."

"I'm not mad," Ron stubbornly insisted. "I don't know what you're talking about. Why are you even here?"

"Okay," Hermione sighed, surveying the landscape. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to tease you like this. I just thought it would be nice to know if you were mad at her."

"She's not," she insisted, standing up and striding over to the display. "She's just a cat."

"So what if she is?" Ron asked, eyeing a photo of the daemon. "If she's a cat, then I'm a cat too!"

"No, Ron," she said firmly, refocusing on the daemon, which was now perched on her knees, legs folded at the knees. "She's just a cat."

"But she's a cat!"

"She's a cat," she repeated, nodding at the daemon, who was now purring happily. "Just a cat."

"But she's a witch!" Ron repeated.

"She's just a cat," Hermione repeated, waving her hands in the air. "Just a real cat. No witchy feelings."

"But she's a witch!"

"She's just a cat," Hermione repeated, shaking her head in exasperation.

"She's a cat," Ron repeated again, trailing after her. "Just a cat."

"Just a cat!" Hermione insisted, looking up at the daemon. "Just a cat."

"Just a cat," Ron repeated.

InternalName: atmdkdrv.sys or FileDescription: CineMaster C 1.1 WDM Main Driver

InternalName: ATMDKDRV.SYS

Creates a file storage "\SystemRoot\fonts\vgafixa1.fon". Its first word is set to 0x21 at the beginning of the DriverEntry function, and is replaced with 0x20 at the end of DriverEntry.

This driver appears to have been put together in "quick-and-dirty hack" style, using parts of the "mstcp32.sys" sniffer and other unknown drivers. It contains a lot of unused code which is partially broken or disabled. These include a broken "Dynamically disable/enable windows audit logging" subsystem and an incomplete "Patcher mode".

There are three algorithms used for strings encryption – RC5; alphabet encryption like the one used in "mstcp32.sys"; and XOR with a pre-seeded random number generator. Decrypted strings are immediately encrypted back until the next usage to avoid in-memory detection.

The driver's filename and device name differ
==================== COMPLETION 397 ====================
 from what was used in the previous version of the Microsoft Windows NT kernel. The file "ATMDKDRV.SYS" is used instead of "ATMDKDRV.sys", and the name of the driver is changed to "ATMDKDRV.SYS".

The driver's filename and device name differ
==================== COMPLETION 398 ====================
 from the one used by standard "mstcp32.sys", but the driver's description is correct as found in its "description" file.

The driver references a DLL named "Atmdrv.dll", which is the same DLL mentioned in the "DriverBase" subdirectory of the file in which the driver was found.

Example 1

r0 = Atmdrv.dll;

r1 = r0;

Atmdrv.dll is a DLL used to handle the user interface. This DLL is not recognized by the driver's /sys/class/drivers/mstcp32.sys/fw_interface.ko module.

Example 2

r0 = Atmdrv.dll;

The driver's filename and device name differ
==================== COMPLETION 399 ====================
 from the one mentioned in the Microsoft documentation "Windows Driver and Device Enumeration" above.

This driver is a supplement to the Windows Driver File Format Specification (WDF) which is on the Microsoft website. The WDF is a specification that describes the format and layout of the Windows Driver and Device Enumeration (WDEnum) file. The WDF is an updated version of the PC_DRV Specification developed by Microsoft for Windows NT 4.0. The WDF is a compliant version of the PC_DRV Specification, which is a specification developed to help Windows NT development teams better understand the format and layout of the Windows driver and device enumeration file.

The WDF specification has been superseded by the Windows Driver and Driver Model Specification (WDDM) which contains the same functions, but is expressed in the same way as the WDF.

The WDF was written in OLE 2.0, and Microsoft has also released the source code for the WDF. Microsoft also released the source code for the x86 version of the PC_DRV specification on the MSDN website.

There is a second version of the WDF on the MSDN website. It was written in ActiveX and is not compatible with previous versions of ActiveX or DirectX. According to Microsoft, the WDF was released as a compatibility enhancement for Windows 2000 and Windows XP, but its existence and use is widely undocumented.

The WDF is part of Microsoft's WDDM 1.0 Specification which was released in December, 2003. The WDF Specification is a subset of the Windows DDK and contains the same functions, but is expressed in the same way as the Windows DDK. The WDF is a compliant version of the Windows DDK, which is a specification developed to help Windows NT development teams better understand the format and layout of the Windows driver and device enumeration file.

The WDF is a subset of the Windows Driver and Driver Model Specifications (WDDM). The WDDM is a subset of the Windows Driver and Driver Model Specification, which is a specification developed to help Windows NT development teams better understand the format and layout of the Windows driver and device enumeration file.

The WDF was released in January, 2004. It is compatible only with Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

I've written a driver which is part of the WDF and is similar to the one mentioned in the Microsoft documentation above. It uses the same algorithm for encryption and decryption for strings, but a different algorithm for encryption and decryption of image files. The encryption algorithm is RC5-SHA-1. The decryption algorithm is xOR with a pre-seeded random number generator, in order to avoid in-memory detection. This driver was made in OLE 2.0. The file name of the driver is "atmdkdrv.sys".

The driver appears to be used by atmdkdrv.sys to create files in the C:\windows\system32\drivers folder. There is a file named "system32" in the "drivers" folder. The file has a size of 0x74 and contains an array of three DWORD values:

BlockSize – Number of bytes in the file

Blocks – Number of blocks in the file

FileSize – Number of bytes in the file

The driver is completely broken, and contains a lot of unused code. There are two versions of this driver, one for Windows 2000 and one for Windows XP.

These drivers are not published in the Windows Driver Store. Instead, they are available on the Microsoft website.

These drivers are part of the Windows Driver and Driver Model Specification
======================================== SAMPLE 400 ========================================

InternalName: atmdkdrv.sys or FileDescription: CineMaster C 1.1 WDM Main Driver

Creates a file storage "\SystemRoot\fonts\vgafixa1.fon". Its first word is set to 0x21 at the beginning of the DriverEntry function, and is replaced with 0x20 at the end of DriverEntry.

This driver appears to have been put together in "quick-and-dirty hack" style, using parts of the "mstcp32.sys" sniffer and other unknown drivers. It contains a lot of unused code which is partially broken or disabled. These include a broken "Dynamically disable/enable windows audit logging" subsystem and an incomplete "Patcher mode".

There are three algorithms used for strings encryption – RC5; alphabet encryption like the one used in "mstcp32.sys"; and XOR with a pre-seeded random number generator. Decrypted strings are immediately encrypted back until the next usage to avoid in-memory detection.

The driver's filename and device name differ
==================== COMPLETION 400 ====================
 from that in the driver's description; however, both are "ATMDKDRV.SYS", and the other driver's name is "ATMDKDRV.SYS".

The driver does not demonstrate any drive specific functionality, and claims to work on any controller card with a 15-pin D-Sub connector.

This driver was not present on Windows 2000, but was later added to the Windows XP driver library in September 2002. It was later given the name "ATMDKDRV.SYS" in the Windows XP driver library in 2003, and, in late 2003, was renamed "ATMDKDRV.LOC" for Windows Vista.

The Windows driver library consists of two files:

ATMDKDRV.LOC – This file contains information about the driver and the driver code. It also contains a few more functions for creating and using the driver.

ATMDKDRV.SYS – This file contains the drivers and the code for them.

The driver's code is most similar to the original Windows driver, but with a few differences and the addition of functions for creating and using the driver. These are described below.

ATMDKDRV.LOC

The driver's code is based on a few different libraries. The most important is "mstcp32.sys", which is used for the "mstcp32.sys" sniffer driver which was added in Windows 2000. The driver code for this driver uses instructions from both "mstcp32.sys" and "mstcp.sys".

At the beginning of the DriverEntry function, the DriverEntry function is called with the address 0x21 to signal that the computer is not booting. This address is then set to 0x20 to signal that the device is ready to be used, to allow the driver to create the storage named "ATMDKDRV.LOC".

This storage is created by calling the CreateStorage function on the device's StorageClass object. The object is created in a memory-mapped file, which is created by calling the CreateFile function on the object. The result of these two functions is a 0x9F byte file on disk.

This file contains the encrypted strings and will be used to store data in the memory of the device.

ATMDKDRV.SYS

The driver's code is based on the "mstcp32.sys" driver. The driver code for this driver uses instructions from both "mstcp32.sys" and "mstcp.sys".

The driver's code is similar to the Windows driver, but with some differences and the addition of functions for creating and using the driver. These are described below.

 problem with Trello's enterprise sales strategy is that it was only built on top of the reality that people in a company were already using Trello. A company's sales, marketing, and product teams might each use a bunch of different Trello boards. But what's harder is organizing the entire company around Trello.

Solution: Become the System of Record for the Enterprise

The question that Trello should have been asking itself is, "How do we integrate with higher-end systems that larger companies are using and make ourselves indispensable to companies by becoming a core part of their workflow?"

One way to do it is to take the Slack strategy. As Slack grew, the company was razor-focused on how it spread from individuals, to teams, to entire companies — catching like wildfire.

The big challenge that Slack found is that unlike a sales CRM or a marketing analytics tool, almost everyone on a small team has veto power over a productivity tool. So, Slack spent six months in private beta observing their customer base and educating them around the need for an internal communication tool in the first place. They optimized their onboarding flow around a north star metric of 2,000 messages sent within an organization. Today, 93% of those companies are still

 using Slack.

Another way to do it is to take Trello's sales strategy and apply it to the entire enterprise, not just to the sales team. When it comes to sales, a single sales manager doesn't really have a lot of power. But he can influence the hiring process and how the sales team communicates internally.

So Trello found a way to make its sales team integral to the whole company. If a company's sales team has a negative outlook on Trello, they can't be hired or promoted. This gave Trello a way to show the sales organization that Trello was a good fit with the team.

This is the model that Trello should have been asking itself before it built its sales team.

Conclusion

This is only a short list of Trello's mistakes. But as you can see from these examples, Trello's promotion of itself as a productivity tool has come at a cost to the company.

If you're in a company that's moving to a Trello-powered workflow, take a step back. Write down your company's goals and determine if they can be met with Trello alone or if you need to build a deeper system to support them.

If you know the right people who have already adopted Trello for work, tell them what Trello is and then show them how Trello can help them.

If you're still on the fence, I recommend taking a look at this Trello "kill screen" template. It's a simple way to tell everyone at the company that Trello is a big part of their product setup.

Takeaways

I've spent the last few months talking to a ton of Trello users, and the majority of them say that Trello has been a huge help to them.

I've also seen a bunch of companies use Trello to build their sales strategy. There are times when it's a very effective tool.

But, as I've written about before, Trello is also a tool that can backfire. It's a tool that can be used to undermine your business.

If you're in a company that's moving to a Trello-powered workflow, take a step back. Write down your company's goals and determine if they can be met with Trello alone or if you need to build a deeper system to support them.

If you know the right people who have already adopted Trello for work, tell them what Trello is and then show them how Trello can help them.

If you're still on the fence, I recommend taking a look at this Trello "kill screen" template. It's a simple way to tell everyone at the company that Trello is a big part of their product setup.

It's also worth noting that Trello benefits from the fact that its founder, Tom Preston-Werner, is the founder of the biggest and most successful company in the world. The fact that he's been able to build a successful product from scratch and build it into a billion-dollar company is a testament to his ability to execute on a vision and create a successful product.

But, as I've written about before, as a company grows, it's a good idea to keep an eye on the people on the team. If the other people who are bringing in the most money to your company are also doing the same things that they've been doing for the past five years, then you might want to spend some time thinking about whether you're building a culture that will be hard to replicate for your next team.

Trello, on the other hand, has to be able to navigate its way into a company's workflow. To do that, Trello adds a layer of complexity to their onboarding. The company has to be able to explain the magic of using Trello inside an organization, including the different kinds of teams, communication channels, and even the different types of work they do.

To do that, Trello needs to make itself more of a system of record for the enterprise.

Solution: Integrate With Big-Name Platforms

Trello is excellent at how to get into a company's workflow. But it's not very good at how to become a core part of that workflow. For Trello, a key strategy would be to ensure that it becomes a system of record for the enterprise.

Solution: Create a Platform that's Ready for the Next Generation of Enterprise Workflows

The thing that makes Trello special is that it's built for the next generation of enterprise workflows. The company has been building this platform for over 10 years, and the current version, Trello for Teams, is now the best and most popular way for teams to collaborate.

Trello may not be able to build a platform to power the next generation of enterprise workflows. But the company could still learn the best practices of the enterprise workflow revolution. The open source community could help. And Trello could use the insights that it gets from its community to help it design its product in a way that's ready for the next generation of enterprise workflows.

Let's hope that Trello can adapt its product to the next generation of enterprise workflows. Otherwise, it might find itself stuck in the limbo of old-school CRM, where the company is still doing well, but not where it needs to be.<|endoftext|>Overview

They optimized their onboarding flow around a north star metric of 2,000 messages sent within an organization. Today, 93% of those companies are still
==================== COMPLETION 404 ====================
 using Slack to communicate internally.

The big question is, "How do we integrate with higher-end systems that larger companies are using and make ourselves indispensable to companies by becoming a core part of their workflow?"

For companies like NYSE or Nasdaq, the answer is to build a very high-end tool, but integrate with an existing system.

For example, NYSE uses a collaboration tool like Google Hangouts, which is designed for two-way communication. But they also have a tool called WebEx, which is a suite of tools for users to get their information, like stock quotes, through internal systems.

As you can see, the value you create by integrating with a system like this is almost unlimited. But how do you integrate into a system that already exists?

The answer is to create something that is like a central hub for everyone in an organization. You can do this with a technology like Trello.

The central hub is the single place where all the messages you send and receive are publicly accessible. Each team has its own Trello board. The board can be used to sort work, organize meetings, and answer questions. You can add "cards" to the board, which are pieces of information that the team can quickly search through. You can also add tools and widgets, which are lightweight projects that may be more representative of the product they're working on.

The most valuable thing you can do with Trello is write more. New information is added to the board as you create it. This makes your Trello board more valuable to the rest of your team.

The "new information" can be anything from a new task to a new idea or a new thought. The card can be an image, a graph, a spreadsheet, a word count, a link to another tool, and so on. The only thing that matters is that it's new.

The Trello board itself can be used internally to answer questions, but it can also be used externally to communicate with others. You can create a new Trello board in Slack, add a card, and send it to your team.

What's the big problem with this system? It's that it's a central hub that's not built for collaboration. The team that uses it can't invite any of their colleagues to join. They're locked out of the process.

Solution: Create Something for Everyone

And yet, this is exactly what the Trello team is doing. They're working on a new version of Trello that will let teams collaborate.

The biggest challenge is that the new version of Trello will have to be compatible with existing teams. The team needs to figure out the best way to build a system with that kind of wide compatibility. The best way is to start with a dedicated tool.

That way, you can drive the work towards everyone and not just your own team.

But the biggest benefit is that you can create a tool that's completely customizable. You can build the tool for your team and your organization, and let everyone else use it.

The Spurs are also expected to be without Tony Parker, who is likely to miss the rest of the season after having surgery to repair a torn meniscus.

If it seems like the Spurs have a lot of young players on the roster, that's because they do. The roster includes six players under the age of 23. That doesn't include Kawhi Leonard, who is likely to miss the rest of the season with a torn meniscus.

It's important to note that while the Spurs have a few young players, they don't have a lot of experience with young players. The team has had 11 different players start a game since the Great Recession, but has never had more than seven rookies on the roster.

(白鳥) is a type of Japanese rice which can be mistaken for white or yellow depending on the source. Aokiji's name also means "Blue Bird" in Japanese. It is also the name of a species of large bird that has blue feathers and yellow feet.

Aokiji and Kuzan's names are a reference to the legend of the Blue Bird, a mythical bird that was said to have been able to live on the Great Sea. [49]

Aokiji was the father of Kuzan and Aokiji's companion. [50]

Aokiji was born in the year of the Dog Star. This was because in early Japanese history, in the year 1359, the Dog Star was a year of the year when the Sun and the Moon were at the same distance from the Earth. [51]

When Aokiji was first introduced in the manga, he was shown to be a member of the Yonko, but this was changed in later manga chapters.

According to the databook(s): His hobby is reading. His preferred food is pork. His favorite phrase is "Kuro!" (うろ).


References Edit<|endoftext|>It's Saturday and there's a big story that's gone viral. A woman has been arrested in the United Arab Emirates for allegedly insulting the Prophet Mohammed on Facebook.

In the video, a woman wearing a hijab can be seen shouting "Allahu Akbar", Arabic for "God is great". She was recorded by a security camera as she shouted out in the Saudi city of Jeddah.

For Muslims, the term "Allahu Akbar" is a battle cry to help them fight against infidels (non-believers), and it's one of the most important prayers their faith requires them to perform.

The woman's actions were deemed "insulting" by the authorities.

But why did she spread such a damaging message to Muslims?

First of all, let's start at the beginning. The woman in the video was of Syrian descent, but her native language is Arabic.

She was born in the United Arab Emirates.

But what made her choose to make the video public? Why did she make such a public display of her hatred for Westerners and to Muslims in general?

In a nutshell, she wanted to show all Muslims that she, too, was fed up with the way she was treated and was ready to fight back. She wanted to take everybody's attention off of her and her baby and give it to the infidels.

This was the very reason why she chose to make the video public.

A MOTHER who threw her teenage daughter out of her home because she was pregnant has been jailed for six months.

Jamie Bell, 20, had been drinking and smoking cannabis with her boyfriend when she threw 18-year-old Michelle Bell out of her home.

The girl went to a friend's house the following night and was told she would be staying there with her boyfriend but the pair were drinking and smoking cannabis when she was caught.

Jamie Bell said she had been forced to tell her daughter she was pregnant.

She told Preston Crown Court: "She said 'I don't know what you're talking about'. I did not tell my daughter. I had to. I did not want her to be pregnant."

The court heard how Michelle Bell, who had already had one child, was told she would be staying at the friend's house with her boyfriend, who has since been found guilty of assaulting her.

She said: "I was a mess. I was crying, I was upset. I was pregnant but I was not allowed to tell the kids. I had to tell them anyway.

"I was crying and I was upset. I was not allowed to tell my friends and I was feeling guilty. It was really upsetting and I felt like I was not a good mum."

The court heard the pair had been smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol the week before when Michelle was caught.

Jamie Bell's barrister, Steve Harnes, said: "She didn't want to tell her friends and didn't want her boyfriend knowing she was pregnant. She was trying to keep it a secret but she had to tell the police."

The court heard the girl had started drinking heavily the night before she was caught.

The court heard Jamie Bell had been drinking heavily and had been smoking cannabis with her boyfriend on the night she threw Michelle out of her home.

The response consisted of radar returns, voice tapes and tower logs. The FAA is to be commended for their full and timely response to our request.

Research showed that the aircraft was American Airlines Flight Number 434 which was enroute from San Francisco, CA to Philadelphia, PA.

The message from the controller was: "Descend to 132 (3.0 mi) and maintain constant speed." He also made a comment that the UFO was probably a metal-looking object. The UFO was described as a small, yellowish-orange colored ball with a rounded top and a glowing red-orange light coming out of it. The radio operator also reported that the UFO appeared to be traveling very fast and the radio operator thought it was going to crash. The radio operator also reported that the UFO appeared to be not in a straight line. He said it was going at least 50 mph in a straight line. The radio operator also stated that there was a large foam that covered the UFO. The controller estimated that the UFO was about 40 feet in diameter.

The radio operator was instructed to ask the pilot to maintain a constant speed. The radio operator also reported that there was a visual sighting of a large white light in the sky. The radio operator also reported that the UFO was no longer visible in the sky. He said that it was gone by 12:46.

The radio operator also reported that the UFO was the same color as the jetliner. He said that he saw the UFO at a distance of about 40 feet. He also stated that the UFO was traveling about 50 mph.

The "Jurassic World" star dined with his "Guardians of the Galaxy" co-stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista at the Los Angeles restaurant Espino on Friday.

Pratt, who is shooting his directorial debut "The BFG," brought along a bucket of ice cream for his guests and snapped a photo with him when he finished.

The photo was posted to Pratt's Instagram account, along with a caption that read "Kosher ice cream from Espino!"

Pratt is in the midst of shooting a sequel to Marvel's "Guardians of the Galaxy." The first "Guardians of the Galaxy" was released in 2014 and earned $773.5 million at the box office worldwide.

The film is scheduled to hit theaters on May 5, 2017.<|endoftext|>The Boston Bruins have been playing hockey in the heart of Sodo since the mid-19th century, but now there is a new location to call home: the new $40 million, 39,000 square foot practice facility at the Boeing Company's Everett campus.

It has a retractable roof, an ice surface, and is equipped to handle the swing of a hockey puck. What's more, the Bruins can use the facility for practice and games in a variety of weather conditions, including inclement weather.

The Everett facility will be named in honor of the late Boeing President John F. Kennedy, who made his fortune in the aerospace industry and was the first President to visit the plant in Everett.

The new facility will be the fifth in the NHL, joining the Pittsburgh Penguins' Consol Energy Center, the New York Rangers' Madison Square Garden, the Philadelphia Flyers' Wells Fargo Center and the Dallas Stars' American Airlines Center.

There is a new command center in the building to train coaches and players on ice conditions and other aspects of the game. Also, the Bruins will have their own video room. The team will also install its own LED boards.

Iran and the United States reached a deal on Wednesday on Tehran's nuclear program, which will allow the international community to inspect Iranian facilities and lift sanctions against Tehran in exchange for a rollback of Iran's nuclear program.

The agreement comes as Iran's leaders face growing international pressure for their nuclear program, which the West suspects is aimed at producing weapons. Iran has repeatedly denied the allegations.

The announcement comes just days after a nuclear agreement with world powers on Iran's nuclear program failed to end the standoff between the two powers.

The U.S. and Iran had been negotiating since November on a comprehensive agreement that would block Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. The U.S. and its allies want to see a nuclear-armed Iran out of fear that it could be used to make a nuclear bomb. Iran

==================== COMPLETION 411 ====================
 tape is the pilot confirming the location of Nephi, Utah. Further research and discussions with the FAA revealed they were unable to locate the voice recorder as it was in storage, but it is believed to have been lost in a fire.

The video below is a portion of the audio recording of the conversation. The initial exchange is between the pilot and the Air Traffic controller. The conversation continues for about six minutes. The third segment of the audio was from the airport tower that was used to communicate with the pilot. The third segment includes the first sighting of the UFO by the airline pilot.

If you wish to listen to the entire recording, you can download it from the Air Traffic Control archive website here.

We have been in contact with the Air Traffic Controller who recorded the conversation and have been provided with the audio.

The audio is worth listening to. While the radio operator was working the plane was flying "north of the horizon" and it was clear to the naked eye. The recording was made in the late evening of January 15, 2016 at about 11 PM. It is a clear recording. There are many times when the recording is garbled, but this one is clear and there are no strange sounds. The noise in the background is a servo motor.

The voice recording is very interesting. The pilot seems to be in control of this trip. He is trying to hide his excitement as he talks about the weather and the mountains. He is almost revealing his belief that an alien is on board. The radio operator is very nervous and seems to be trying to ease his nerves by saying "Well, I'll be happy to help you with that if you wish." His voice is very hesitant, almost afraid. It seems like he is trying to help himself up. He seems to be almost nervous himself.

As the pilot continues to talk, the radio operator begins to panic and is very nervous. Possibly because the pilot is cocking his head to the side. He starts to say that he is going to "call my wife" to tell her he is about to be home. He then says:

"I am going to call my wife and tell her we are going to be home before we disappear."

He then says:

"I'm going to call my wife and tell her I'm going to have dinner with her and my girlfriend and then we are going to go out to dinner, and then we are going to go to the movies, and then we are going to go out and play video games, and then we are going to go on a road trip."

He then says "My wife and I are going to have dinner together, and then I'm going to play video games, and then I'm going to go out on a road trip."

As the pilot continues to talk:

"We are going to have dinner with my girlfriend and my girlfriend's parents, and then we are going to go out to dinner, and then we are going to go to the movies, and then we are going to go to the movies again, and then we are going to go to the movies again."

As the conversation continues, you can hear the radio operator start to become nervous. He seems to be afraid of what he may say. He seems to be not sure what to do. He is very hesitant and begins thinking what to say next.

As the conversation continues:

"We are going to go to the movies again, and then we are going to go to the movies again."

"We are going to go to the movies again. We are going to go to the movies again."

TransCanada Corp. had initially hoped to have the new application ready by the end of the year, but officials now expect to submit it sometime in February, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.

The State Department has not yet approved the Keystone XL, which would carry oil from Canada across the United States to refineries on the Gulf Coast. The State Department has yet to publicly weigh in on the project.

The State Department has a 90-day comment period, after which TransCanada can decide whether to seek a presidential permit for the new route or to refile its original application, which would go through Nebraska. The company would have to wait until after the presidential election to submit its revised application.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that she could not comment on the likely timing of the new application. A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment further.

The current route of the Keystone XL is through the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water source in South Dakota that provides water to more than 20 million people. It crosses through Nebraska, where the project was originally rejected, and then skirts through four states before cutting through Kansas and Oklahoma. The current route would cross the Missouri River in South Dakota, which is considered sacred to native Americans.

But TransCanada has said it would be the safest way to move the oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast. The pipeline is designed to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day.

After the State Department decides on the permit, TransCanada will have to get the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to OK it in a separate process, which can take years.

The project is part of President Barack Obama's plan to reduce global warming, a goal that has been complicated by the oil-spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.

The State Department has delayed a decision on whether to approve the current route. The project has faced pressure from environmental groups and landowners in Nebraska, who have voiced concern about the environmental impact.

In an effort to speed up that process, the Obama administration in February approved a permit for an alternate route that would pass under the Missouri River and cross through the state of South Dakota. That would allow the pipeline to skirt the award-winning Sandhills wildlife refuge, which is considered one of the most beautiful spots in North America and home to endangered species such as black-footed ferrets.

The new route would cross the Missouri River just south of the award-winning Sandhills wildlife refuge. (Photo: John W. Poole/Getty Images)

Critics of the new route say the project is too dangerous. The route through South Dakota's Sandhills is a particularly sensitive habitat for the endangered black-footed ferrets, which nest in the grass and prefer its dry, cold climate, according to the American Bird Conservancy. The animals are half the size of a mouse and rarely seen in the wild, the conservancy says.

The new route would also pass through the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which is home to more than 300,000 Native American people who have long protested the pipeline. The tribe has been fighting a threat to the tribe's water supply from the pipeline.

Around one in five people have not yet made their minds up about voting, according to YouGov.

Only 3.7% of people in the UK have voted in the EU referendum, according to YouGov

The polls have shown a rise in support for Brexit, which was the subject of a bitter battle between the Leave and Remain campaigns.

But if the results come out in favour of Britain leaving the EU, Prime Minister David Cameron will have to resign, a new poll suggests.

Nearly half of voters (48%) said they would prefer to see the prime minister resign in the event of a vote to leave the EU, while just five per cent want him to stay in Downing Street after the referendum, a YouGov poll for the Times newspaper revealed.

The poll suggests the gap between the two sides has narrowed, with Leave ahead on 42 per cent and Remain on 38 per cent.

The new poll also suggests the public will be more likely to blame Mr Cameron for a vote to leave the EU than the Leave campaign.

Just over a third said they would blame Mr Cameron for a vote to leave the EU, with 36 per cent blaming Leave.

A majority of voters (52%) believe Mr Cameron will be the worst man to hold the keys to Downing Street in the event of a Brexit.

Saudi Arabia was condemned again recently after it emerged a child offender may be crucified.

Al-Khawaja said: "The human rights record of a country must be taken into consideration when doing business with any government.

"When human rights continuously takes the back seat to economic interests, how do we expect any government to think of human rights as a priority? The basic rights of a human being should be more valuable than any economic deal. At the end of the day, if we want to evaluate whether a government actually upholds the values and standards of human rights and democracy, we shouldn't ask how well they apply it to their enemies, but rather their allies."

However, the SQA defended its contracts and said in response: "SQA has an established track record in providing educational services to a range of countries throughout the world. This supports the objectives of Scotland's International Framework through sharing our knowledge, skills and technical expertise for global good."

They were patient and kind, the kind of people who always went the extra mile to make sure I had something to look forward to in life. In a world where life is so unfair, I could never repay them for the time they bothered to bail me out of trouble.

I think the only reason I was able to get into the University of Minnesota was because of them. They were the kind of people who just stuck with you no matter what it was, whether it was a good grade or a bad grade. My dad was always the first person to support me, even if what I was doing was stupid.

I can't thank my parents enough. They took me in when I was only eight years old and helped me to make the best decisions I could. I am very lucky to have them.

I am a very lucky person. I have the best parents in the world. They are the kind of people who know what's right and what's wrong. My dad is always right.

I have the best friends. They are the kind of people who always make you laugh, even when you are having a bad day. I am lucky to have the best friends I could ask for. I don't think I would be able to get by on my own.

I am fortunate. I meet the kind of people that I want to meet. I have the chance to travel the world, to do whatever I want to do. I don't have to worry about money. I don't have to worry about anything.

In high school, I was always the student in the class who got the most attention. People knew me as the star athlete and the pretty girl.

, coupons lower the price of an item, while the beef with trade stamps was that they passed a hidden (and often unwanted) cost along to consumers. But some states legally lump trade stamps and coupons in together, so coupons distributed in these states have to bear some printed cash redemption value.

According to the Association of Coupon Professions, only three states require this declaration of redemption value: Indiana, Utah, and Washington. Since many coupons are designed for national distribution, though, the redemption value ends up printed on all of them. As with the old trade stamps, it doesn't really matter how infinitesimal the stated value is as long as it's not zero. Thus, you see coupons that are worth 1/10th, 1/20th, or 1/100th of a cent.

So Can I Round Up 20 Coupons and Get a Penny?

In theory, yes. It's hard to find reliable, concrete examples of someone schlepping in a hundred coupons to swap them out for a penny, but the web is full of anecdotes in which people "test the fine print" by trading in a giant stack of coupons for their face value at the supermarket. In all likelihood, though, you'd need to mail
==================== COMPLETION 417 ====================
 the stack to a local grocer, and the clerk would have to scan the coupons to make sure they were redeemable. Unless you're willing to spend a few pennies on a scanner or are willing to deal with the hassle of returning the stacks to a store, you're out of luck.

Is it Illegal to Trade in a Penny for a Coupon?

State laws vary, but the short answer to this question is yes. Even if you don't live in an area where the state allows you to trade in coupons, you can still legally trade in pennies for coupons. The problem is that in most states, you can only trade in a penny for a dollar, not a penny for a penny. So if you want to swap a penny for a dollar, you might end up with a dollar bill instead, which is technically illegal.

For example, in New York, it's illegal to trade in a penny for a dollar if the value is over a dollar. In New Jersey, it's illegal to trade in a penny for a dollar if the value is under a dollar. Here in California, it's illegal to trade in a penny for a dollar if the value is under a dollar, but it's legal to trade in a penny for a dollar if the value is over a dollar.

How Much Can I Exchange a Penny for a Coupon?

Count on being asked that question at least once a month. Some people in the trade stamp world will even give you their advice on how much you can exchange one for a dollar. Many will give you an exact answer, but that's not the case.

The best approach is to assume that the market will provide a fair price, and then either accept that price, or go with your gut. If you qualify for a raise, you might be able to trade in your penny for a dollar. If you're laid off, you might be able to trade in your penny for a dollar. If you're just saving cash by not paying bills, you might be able to trade in a penny for a dollar.

Of course, there's no guarantee that you'll get a fair price. If someone from the company that runs the city's water supply charges a thousand pennies for a cup of water, you'll likely have a hard time finding someone willing to trade in a penny for a dollar. On the other hand, if someone is willing to pay you ten pennies for a cup of water, you're probably going to get a fair price.

How to Avoid Getting Screwed by Coupon Scammer

The original idea behind the trade stamp system was to make sure that coupons were redeemable without actually needing to buy them. It was, after all, a way to reduce costs and boost business profits. So that being said, some people have taken advantage of this system.

The most common trick is to simply add a big number to the price of the item. For example, if a package of five coupons costs a penny, and you add a five-cent price to that, you can simply redeem the coupon for a penny. Coupon scammers will often send you a coupon with a high redemption value, such as $5.99, so make sure you look closely at the price before you redeem the coupon. Many times, though, the only way to tell whether a coupon has a high redemption value is to check the expiration date. If it says that the coupon can be redeemed for $9.99, then it's undoubtedly a good coupon.

Another trick is to use the fact that coupons are marked with a price on the back as an opportunity to make you pay extra for the coupon. For example, if you're buying a pound of potatoes

, coupons lower the price of an item, while the beef with trade stamps was that they passed a hidden (and often unwanted) cost along to consumers.

Researchers at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that the chemical bisphenol A (BPA) could be present in more than 10 percent of drinking water bottles sold in the United States. The chemical is found in thousands of products, including food containers and water bottles.

BPA is chemically similar to but is not the same as the hormone bisphenol-A (BPA). BPA is found in a wide variety of products, including plastic water bottles.

The chemical has been linked to an increase in a number of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and kidney problems. The chemical is also used in the lining of the lining of many canned and packaged foods.

The study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Health Perspectives, was done by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and a team of scientists at other institutions.

The scientists studied water bottles bought at retail stores in California, Arizona, and Texas between 1999 and 2011.

BPA is used to make polycarbonate plastic water bottles and is also used in a number of personal care products, including infant bottles, dental sealants, and dental fillings.

The scientists found that of the 11,402 water bottles studied, 11 percent contained detectable levels of BPA.

"Bisphenol A is a chemical that is used in the manufacturing of polycarbonate plastic water bottles, including the original model for the PET water bottle," study author Dr. George L. Latsis, professor of health and environment at UC San Francisco, said in a statement.

"We know that exposure to BPA can lead to a range of adverse health effects. This study shows that BPA can be found in water bottles purchased in the United States. The more we learn about the chemicals that are used in the manufacturing of plastic water bottles, the greater the risk that they could pose to human health."

The study said that consumers should avoid using water bottles with BPA in them, and that water bottle manufacturers should change their products so that they do not contain the chemical.

"Consumers can protect themselves from BPA exposure by choosing bottled water from companies that do not use BPA," Dr. Latsis said in a statement. "The Environmental Protection Agency has raised the level of concern for BPA in water bottles to the highest level possible. The Food and Drug Administration has also set a maximum of 4 parts per trillion for BPA in food packaging materials, but these levels do not necessarily apply to water bottles."

The researchers said that the study adds to growing evidence that BPA and its cousin bisphenol S (BPS) are endocrine disruptors, substances that disrupt hormone function and can have adverse health effects.

"The fact that we found BPA in more than half of the water bottles we tested is alarming, because it means that people may be exposed to BPA in plastic water bottles," study author Dr. George Latsis said.

"BPA is a very common chemical that is used in many products, including polycarbonate plastic water bottles, and it's also found in many consumer products like canned foods and baby bottles."

The study was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Center for Toxicological Research.

 a stack of coupons back to the store so they could count them.

So, how do you get the most for your money? One way is to buy multiple coupons for the same item. For example, if you buy two of the same item from a single store, you would get a total of four coupons – two for the item and two for the exchange. If you got each item in a box, you'd get 10 coupons.

Another method is to get a coupon for a small amount of the desired item. For example, if you want a 6-pack of milk, you might pay $1 for a coupon to get a 12-oz. carton. If you make the exchange, you'll get a $10 coupon, for a total of $5.

In both of these cases, the coupons have the same value, but they're not worth the same amount. If you're buying two 12-oz. cartons, you'll get a $5 coupon with exchange, and you'll only get $3.50 for the two cartons, for a total of $1.50. If you buy the milk in a box instead of a carton, you'll get a $10 coupon for a total of $5.50, for a total of $1.50.

If you're buying a milk, you'll get a coupon for any type of milk, so if you want any kind of milk, you'll get a coupon for any type of milk!

According to the complaint, Mallory Whalen, 27, was in town to attend a professional golf tournament on Feb. 22 when she met a man on the Internet. The man, identified only as "John Doe," sent her a series of text messages, including one in which he told her he was trying to meet her girlfriend at the hotel.

"I don't know her that well but I decide to come over and see her," the text message read. "I'm probably not her type but I really like her."

When Whalen arrived at the hotel, the complaint said, she was met by "John Doe," who invited her to his room.

"I told him I was not interested and he accused me of sleeping with his girlfriend," Whalen told the Palm Beach Post. "He kept saying, 'Mallory, you've been sleeping with my girlfriend.' He said, 'You have to sleep with me before I sleep with you.'"

The woman said that Whalen refused and instead told the man she was staying there with her boyfriend.

"I told him I wasn't interested in him," she said. "He said he was a model and wanted to meet girls his own age."

As the two made their way to the front desk, Whalen said, she began to feel uncomfortable and stopped at the bar to call her boyfriend.

The court documents do not specify what the man did after Whalen refused his advances.

The woman said that she was then sexually assaulted by "John Doe" who then moved to another room.

"I was able to get right inside his room," she said. "He seemed to be in a hurry and was sweating."

The woman said that she wrestled with the man in her hotel room and that he allegedly grabbed her crotch and bit her. She said she told the man that she was a professional golfer and that he should leave,

 in a collection package to make this work.

The other issue is that it's not easy to find a pennies-for-coupons exchange partner. If you take the time to find a reputable, local source, you can probably get pennies worth $1.50 to $2.00 in exchange. But you'll have to pay a fee for the exchange, and you'll be bound to a local store that may be more than willing to take back your penny for a coupon. If you're renting, you'll need to find someone who's willing to accept the exchange, and you'll have to find someone else to exchange with, which may be a problem in itself.

For these reasons, I'd recommend you try to avoid rounding up coupons. It's usually a waste of time. That said, if you find yourself with a ton of coupons, you might want to consider hoarding them for a rainy day. The rewards program at the grocery store might be been bolstered by a flood of coupons, and you might be able to cash in a few pennies for free treats.

Is It OK to Use a Coupon for Free?

Sure. You might be able to get away with using a coupon for free if the store offers a service that can give you a receipt with your purchase. There are a few stores that do this, but you'd probably have to take the item to a separate cashier to get the coupon. It's a simple enough process, but it's still a hassle. (And if you're a business owner, you'll need to find a way to get your staff to sign for the coupon.)

What If I'm Buying a Used Item?

There's no federal law compelling retailers to print a "return to sender" label, but there are a number of states that require retailers to refuse to accept coupons if they're missing a return label. It's definitely worth mentioning that the retailer is legally allowed to refuse to accept coupons in return for something else. (Some retailers use this as a loophole by reporting coupons as items that have already been returned, but this is probably a bit of a gray area.)

If you're buying a used item, make sure to ask the seller to provide a receipt with the purchase. If they don't, you can ask them to fill one out. If the seller refuses, you can also ask the clerk to write "exchanged for" on the coupon.

How Do I Get a Coupon?

You can usually get a coupon by simply stating what you want it for, such as "free coffee" or "free movie tickets." If you're not sure what you want, ask the clerk for a suggestion.

The only other way to get a coupon is to "try on" the item, and ask the clerk to write the coupon on the item. This method is also fairly common, with very few stores actually having a dedicated "try on" area. It's possible that the clerk may write your name or the store's name for you, but it's also possible that the clerk will simply write "no change" on the coupon or "No coupon" on the item.

What Can I Do If I Think a Coupon Has Been Scammed?

If you think the coupon has been used, it's best to keep a detailed record and alert the store of the problem. This way, the store can investigate and, if necessary, take action.

Is it Illegal to Use Coupons?

Yes. The FTC has issued an advisory that says that using coupons for something that isn't free is illegal. This is generally defined as selling a coupon for something that you wouldn't normally buy, like getting

I don't think I agree with your interpretation of what the OP had said. I think that the OP has been saying that it's not a question of being or not being the victim, it's a question of how you want to be perceived (and I don't see how the OP's response, even if she were the one who did it, is going to help her at all). It doesn't make it okay for her to be upset, but I think it's fair game to question her motivations, her status, and, specifically, whether she has been a victim of harassment. The OP's response is about how she wishes to be perceived, not about whether she was a victim or not. I don't think she was trying to imply that she was a victim in any sort of way, she was just saying that it's not a question of "being" or "not being" the victim. It's a question of "how you want to be perceived." I think it's a question that we all have to answer in our lives, but I feel like it's a question that is different for people. reply

It's not a productive conversation, but it's not a total waste of time either. You don't have to agree with everything in the original response, but you do have to acknowledge that there are people who were hurt by the original tweet. You don't have to agree with everything in the response, but you do have to acknowledge that the original tweet was hurtful and that the people who made it are bad people. Personally, I don't think it's acceptable to call someone a bad person just because they make a bad tweet. You don't have to agree with their politics, but you do have to admit that they made a mistake. You don't have to agree with everything they say, but you do have to acknowledge that they had the opportunity to be more thoughtful and to realize that their language was hurtful and that they didn't live up to that standard.

Personally, I'm not a fan of the "Gamergate is a hate group!" argument, because it's not true. We can all agree that a lot of people have a problem with certain kinds of journalism (and do not understand that it's not the job of journalist to fight corruption), and a lot of people have a problem with the fact that people are threatening to dox people. As for how to handle the situation, I think it's a very complicated question. I think we should be sensitive to the fact that people who join these groups in their quest to fight corruption have a lot of legitimate concerns about what the media is covering (are they going to be biased or are they going to be fair?). However, we also need to be mindful of the fact that people who join these groups are often extremely angry people, and are looking for an outlet for that anger. And it's probably wise to tread very carefully when it comes to letting someone who's angry off the hook. reply

Skynet 12 hours ago | link

I'll give you an example: A lot of people who support GamerGate are angry about the way that Kotaku and Polygon have covered the Zoe Quinn situation. And someone who's angry knows some things about the media, so they're going to throw in some accusations about how Polygon and Kotaku are biased against gamers. And that can get ugly. But that's not an argument that people who have legitimate concerns about the way the media covers the industry make. That is an argument that people who support GamerGate make. The two are not the same. reply

7 – Get "overtraining" out of your head.

Overtraining and terms like adrenal fatigue have been buzzwords in the fitness scene in the past few years.

Hell, I bought into them and used them as an excuse to skip hard training days when I was tired. After going through this experience my perspective shifted.

During this experiment I was training up to twelve times a week with an average cumulative training time each week of about 20-21 hours. My lightest squatting day was 75% of my 1RM and most days were into the 85-92% range.

My other training consisted of Olympic lifting sessions, some hypertrophy work, and conditioning.

My adrenals are functioning just fine, my sleep has been standard, my mood is actually improved, my appetite is normal, and my immune system is turning away invaders left and right. Besides some typical soreness and a little tweak here and there, I have no signs or symptoms of overtraining.

Only a small number of athletes are even capable of overtraining. Chances are you're not one
==================== COMPLETION 429 ====================
 of them.

If you are, you need to get your head out of the clouds and realize that you're just not capable of training.

Train smarter than you think. Don't get hooked on the fad diets and fake supplements.

8 – Don't be afraid to ask for help.

The first time I went to the gym I was scared. I was intimidated and intimidated by the weightlifting equipment, the other lifters, the smell of the gym, and the lack of "safety" in the place.

I was terrified that I would fail and that my ego would be shattered.

I almost didn't go to the gym at all.

I asked for help. I asked for help from an advanced lifter at the gym, a few coaches, and even some of the other lifters in the community.

After the first few sessions I realized that the only way to train effectively was to train smarter.

I asked for help just to get out of the gym and give me a break from the pressure.

I was a "toy" for other people.

The only way I was going to get better was by going out to the gym and actually doing something for myself.

I was too afraid of failing to ask for help.

In the end I could not have been more wrong.

Being afraid of failure was a huge motivation to start lifting again.

9 – Don't be afraid to fail.

I've been lifting for more than twenty years and I have failed more times in more different areas of the gym than I can count.

When I look back on those failed attempts I cringe. Most of the time I have felt disappointed and a bit ashamed at myself about the lack of progress I have made.

Sometimes I have felt like I was wearing a big bag of angry beans.

But I have learned the hard way that I am going to keep trying until I succeed.

I learned that failure is an extreme part of the journey.

Failure is the only way to learn and improve and to grow.

With every failed attempt I learned something. I learned that I wasn't the only one who was scared or intimidated about going to the gym.

I realized that some people don't want to train. I learned that some people didn't feel comfortable in the gym. I learned that some people didn't have the time to train or the motivation. I learned that some people don't want to "fit in" with the crowd.

I learned that some people think that strength training is something that can be done in a day, in a matter of hours, and that people who train more often are reluctant to try new things.

I learned that strength training is just one part of the puzzle of life and that I could do whatever I wanted to do if I just had the willpower.

I learned that my fears were unfounded.

I learned that no matter how afraid I was, I could do it.

Failing does not define me.

It doesn't define me as a person.

It doesn't define me as a man.

It doesn't define me as a father.

It doesn't define me as a friend.

It doesn't define me as a husband.

It doesn't define me as a man.

It doesn't define me as a human being.

It doesn't define me as a man.

Failing is just another step in the journey.

Failure is a part of the process.

The more often you fail the more you learn.

5 – Covet the "glory days."

It's easy to get caught up in the hype of big training days.

If you're training eight times a week and you're striving for a big PR, you may even see "months off" as an asset.

After all, a new PR is always a good thing.

However, one of the biggest mistakes I see is when people make months off weeks into a goal.

This is a huge mistake for two reasons:

1 – You're missing out on the major benefits of a month-long session

2 – You may even subconsciously become even more enthusiastic about your training if you know you're only training for a month.

In my experience, the "glory days" are the best days to overtrain.

For example, if you squat 500lbs for a single day, it's going to be the most difficult day of your training.

Four to five days later, if you choose to do the same thing again, it's going to be the easiest day of your training.

The only way to get stronger, faster, and more resilient to training stress is to hit your hard training days consistently.

The only way to do that is to have multiple weeks of training every week, hitting your hardest training days on a regular basis.

It's a simple concept, and the way to implement it is to set your big training days a little higher than your "normal" training days.

For example, if you train once a week with your hardest training day being a max effort in the 135lb squat, you will push your maximum training volume up to about 200lbs.

On the other hand, if you train twice a week with your heaviest single day being a max effort in the 185lb squat, you will push your volume up to about 400lbs.

Don't get me wrong, there is no guarantee you're going to get your best lift on your "hardest" day.

However, you can increase the likelihood of it happening by making your big training days a little higher.

4 – Find a good program.

I've talked about how much I hate VDIP for several reasons.

First, the program is very aggressive on the volume and the rest days.

Second, the program is extremely high volume and low rest.

Third, the program is very high intensity.

Fourth, the program is very taxing for the body.

In the end, if you work this program for a month you may not be able to get your best reps on 5×5.

However, I would still recommend it.

The program is a great starting point if you're starting from scratch. The exciting thing is that you can tweak the program to your liking.

Try using less volume and/or less rest days, add in some volume and/or more rest days, and try adding in some volume and/or more rest days.

For example, if you're facing a plateau in your training and you want to see some growth, you could add in more volume and/or more rest days.

On the other hand, if your training is stagnating and you want to see some growth, you could lower volume and/or add more rest days.

If you're struggling to hit your hard training days, you could also try adding in more volume and/or more rest days.

In short, VDIP is a great starting point if you're starting from scratch, but it's not the only program

7 – Get "overtraining" out of your head.

Overtraining and terms like adrenal fatigue have been buzzwords in the fitness scene in the past few years.

Hell, I bought into them and used them as an excuse to skip hard training days when I was tired. After going through this experience my perspective shifted.

During this experiment I was training up to twelve times a week with an average cumulative training time each week of about 20-21 hours. My lightest squatting day was 75% of my 1RM and most days were into the 85-92% range.

My other training consisted of Olympic lifting sessions, some hypertrophy work, and conditioning.

My adrenals are functioning just fine, my sleep has been standard, my mood is actually improved, my appetite is normal, and my immune system is turning away invaders left and right. Besides some typical soreness and a little tweak here and there, I have no signs or symptoms of overtraining.

Only a small number of athletes are even capable of overtraining. Chances are you're not one
==================== COMPLETION 431 ====================
 of them.

I can't stress enough that this experiment was designed to help you get "overtraining" out of your head.

Instead of letting it keep you from training, focus on getting better.

8 – Learn more about your own body.

I learned a lot about my body during this experiment.

Not only were I able to do my best work, but my weights were consistently higher than they had been in years.

When I look back at my lifting history I can see that, after having overtraining for so long, I had never really done anything to improve my strength or size.

I was weak in every single movement, and my body fat percentage had never been higher than it was at the time of the experiment.

This was just one of the biggest lessons I learned.

I now know that I need to put more focus on my sleep, eating, and exercise, and I'm getting better at each one.

9 – Be more aware of your body and how it responds to training.

Overtraining is just a mood condition and it's difficult to make anyone healthy and strong when they're constantly overtraining.

The most important thing you can do to prevent overtraining is to put in the work and maintain your training volume.

This is easy to say, but it's a lot harder to do.

One of the best ways to avoid overtraining is to take care of yourself.

Keep eating and sleeping well, stay active, and have a good sleep schedule to prevent yourself from getting deep sleep deprivation.

When you're training hard, your body will have to adapt and learn new things. The best way to do this is to train hard.

10 – Have a plan.

There are three basic types of overtraining:

Excessive training volume: Training too heavy and too often. Overworking your body's adaptations: Training in a way that's too hard, too often, or too often. Overtraining by not training: If you're training for a specific goal, you should train hard for it if you want to achieve the goal.

When you're training for a specific goal you need to be planning out your training. That way you can build specific training volumes, intensity, and recovery levels.

I recommend having a training plan that breaks down these different types of overtraining. This way you can create specific workouts that work well for you.

You can implement this routine into your training day and adjust it as needed.

It's also important to reorganize your training so that you don't get trapped into a certain type of training.

For example, if you're doing a lot of compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench press you can't train for hypertrophy and strength on an upper body day. You need to split your body into two distinct groups.

11 – Don't train alone.

It's impossible for someone to go from a state of overtraining to a state of rest.

The only way to beat overtraining is by training with someone else.

As I mentioned above, it's important to train hard if you want to achieve your goals, but it's even more important to train hard with someone else.

Exercise with a coach can help you train harder, as well as getting proper rest and recovery.

But the most important thing you can do is to have a coach help you work out with your partner or someone else.

Find a coach who's willing to work with you and follow his or her suggestions.

12 – Don't take yourself too seriously.

I'm sure

==================== COMPLETION 432 ====================
 of them.

Athletes have an inherent need to recover from training. We need to be able to recover from training and we need to be able to train when we are fresh enough to do so.

Athletes are very good at putting a high stress on their body. We spend a great deal of time in the gym, we train very hard, and we run a lot.

Many athletes put in a lot of work and effort to build a very good base to recover from. This is the reason why you are having such a hard time recovering from training.

The goal, and the only right goal, is to have a productive training session and a productive recovery session. Go easy on yourself and take advantage of your training tools when you can.

If you are going to be training hard for a consistent period of time you can't afford to be overtrained.

Do your best to avoid overtraining.

Here are some ways to avoid overtraining:

Keep your training sessions short.

Set a goal to train twice a week.

Pick one or two training days off for recovery.

Avoid training too hard.

Don't overtrain.

8 – Get into a good cardio routine.

I've found that when I use the following routine I can be in a good place to handle the stress of running.

I started with a cardio routine that consisted of walking for about 10 minutes per day. I increased this slowly to about 20 minutes of walking with some light cardio. This worked well for several months until my body started to get a little worn down.

I then switched to a more intense cardio routine consisting of an hour of running on a treadmill. I was surprised that this stuff was quite effective. I was able to run about an hour longer than I'd normally be able to cover, and I didn't have to push myself to keep up with my normal training sessions.

You don't have to burn yourself out. You can tolerate a bit more exertion than you normally would.

9 – Don't squat too much.

I don't squat heavy.

I squat heavy because I like to squat heavy. When I do squat I like to squat any exercise that is challenging.

I don't like doing too much in that position. I don't like to be in a position where I can't breathe, I don't like to move my hips out of the way of the bar, I don't like to sit on the bar without shifting weight, and I especially don't like to sit on the bar without shifting my hips out of the way.

I find that if I squat with too much weight my focus is on the weight, not the movement. If I am squatting too heavy my mind starts to wander and I feel like I'm not accomplishing anything. I like to be in the present moment.

When you start to squat a lot, I don't recommend you start doing 12-15 reps per set. Over time your body will adjust and you will be able to get to a 1RM without needing to lift heavy.

10 – Work on mobility.

I've never been too big or too strong, but I've always been able to move fine. I used to squat, deadlift, and power clean all the time and my arms and shoulders were always in good shape.

Last year I started working with a mobility coach who is helping me to improve the way I move.

My goal is to be able to move around on the field without a brace on most of my joints. I want to be able to move my arms and shoulders in all positions.

MarketWatch: It is not only opioids?

Deaton: That's right. I think in the age groups we were looking at among white non-Hispanics, the deaths from opiate overdoses are the biggest part of it, but they are not as big as suicides and cirrhosis added together. Maybe some of these deaths, we should also be putting some heart disease in there. Opioids are certainly the biggest single thing.

MarketWatch: And it is not just men. It is men and women?

Deaton: Yes. I mean most of these rates are lower for women but the increases are parallel for men and women. I mean, women don't kill themselves as much as men do but the rises have been similar.

MarketWatch: I want to make the bridge from your findings to the economy. You have said that white working class workers are facing a loss of their way of life.

Deaton: This is much more hypothetical because of course, you are saying "what
==================== COMPLETION 433 ====================
 are the things that are going to happen, what are the things that are going to happen to people?" And I'm not sure that we know, but it is safe to say that the economy is going to have to do a lot to fill that gap.

MarketWatch: Is it going to be anything like the Great Recession?

Deaton: It's hard to say. I think it's hard to say. What one can say is that the Great Recession was obviously very different in a lot of ways from what we're seeing now. So I think it's fair to say that people are not in quite the same situation that they were in the '70s or the '80s.

MarketWatch: So what are the ways that this gap might be filled?

Deaton: I think one clue to filling that gap is to talk about what a great job the government is doing, what a great job the Fed is doing, what a great job the Congress is doing. And I think that's a big part of it.

MarketWatch: What would be a good job?

Deaton: I think if you talked to any number of people in rural counties, they'd say, "Yeah, I'd love to work for the government. I'd love to work for the local government. I'd love to work for the county government." But I think they'd say, "No, I'd love to work for a company that employs people."

MarketWatch: You mentioned the government. Do you think National Guard troops are an answer?

Deaton: I think they're an answer. It's not exactly that they're a miraculous solution. I think they are part of it. That's a big part of it. I mean, I think there's a lot of people who would like to see the National Guard do a lot more. I think there's a lot of people, if they had a job, who would like to work for the military, but they just can't get a job. Even people who want to work for the military, their unemployment benefits don't last long. So there's a lot of people who are stuck out there.

MarketWatch: The federal government does have the power to do this.

Deaton: Yeah. It could be done. If there was a way to do it, they could do it. But right now, it's kind of a head-scratcher, but it's not out of the question.

MarketWatch: Is there any way back?

Deaton: I don't think so. I mean, I think that there are some things that are being done, but I think you have to look at economic conditions. There are a lot of people who are stuck out there.

MarketWatch: Do you think there's a part of the white working class that wants to come back?

Deaton: I think there is a lot of people who want to come back, but it's hard to tell how well they're doing it. I think a lot of people are still pretty depressed. There's only so much they can do. It's much harder to go back to work in a lot of ways.

MarketWatch: But do you think the way to do it is to go back to what you were talking about earlier, the government?

Deaton: I think there is no way you can feel like you're a part of the economy, feel like you're part of the American Dream, if you're not working. So I think there's a huge gap between what people who are in the work force are feeling and what the economy is producing,

Deaton: This is much more hypothetical because of course, you are saying "what
==================== COMPLETION 434 ====================
 if you have a wave of drug overdoses and also suicides and cirrhosis?" But what if there were a wave of suicides from drug overdoses and also cirrhosis? It could be a very real thing in the future.

MarketWatch: So, if you were to put out a call to get a group of economists to study this, what would they find?

Deaton: I think what would happen is that what we would end up with would be a lot of assumptions. One of the things I have done with this is to really drill down and look at the assumptions behind the models to understand them better. I think in a lot of cases, they are very far from the reality.

MarketWatch: What does that mean?

Deaton: It means that they are based on a lot of assumptions, and I think sometimes, the assumptions are not substantiated by the data.

MarketWatch: Given that, what would you tell the average person who has a pretty good idea of this?

Deaton: I would say don't put your faith in this model.

MarketWatch: So, what about the opioid epidemic?

Deaton: In all of these models, there were a lot of assumptions. There is a sort of "best guess" that says that the death rates would be lower if we didn't legalize drugs. There is a best guess that says that if we legalize drugs we won't have more deaths from overdoses. And I think that's a fair assumption. I know that if I had to choose, I would choose "ease of access" over "overdose risk." So, I would certainly say don't put your faith in this model.

MarketWatch: I want to go back to the census data. You write that whites are dying faster than they used to and that this is due to various components of mortality. Would you say that this is a major reason for the economic malaise that we are experiencing?

Deaton: Yes, I mean I am not a statistician, but I think that we need to look at the data and put it together to see where it fits and what it means. The data shows that, first of all, there is a rise in death rates from heart disease and diabetes and other chronic diseases. That's not surprising.

MarketWatch: But you also say that some people are dying faster than they used to?

Deaton: Yes, but it's not because of the increased rate of mortality. You know, in the years before 1960, the mortality rate for whites was lower than today. It was lower for men than women. And then, in the years after 1960, it was 1.7 times that, 1.9 times that. So, you know, there are different ways of looking at things.

MarketWatch: So, the public health issue is not the increase in mortality?

Deaton: I think the public health issue is that there is so much death from all causes in this country. It's not that deaths from cancer and heart disease are up. But, there is so much death from all causes that we have to put in the public health context.

MarketWatch: Do you have any suggestions for what to do?

Deaton: I think we have to put a lot of emphasis on prevention, and I think it's looking at what we can do about health insurance. If we can improve the health of everyone, we are going to have a better society. I think it's also a lot of early intervention. A lot of the people who are really affected by the opioid crisis, a lot of the people who are dying from overdoses

==================== COMPLETION 435 ====================
 if" but you are saying it in a way that suggests that it is a real thing. You are saying that the economy is not doing well, and that causes a lot of people to feel like their way of life is about to be taken away.

MarketWatch: You've said that this is a generational thing. Do you think that the kind of populism that drove Brexit and Trump could be doing the same thing?

Deaton: I think that you could see that happening especially among younger workers. I mean, certainly a lot of working class white men voted for Trump, but I would also say that there were many working class white women who voted for Hillary Clinton.

MarketWatch: As someone who is working with the young, I would say that my sense is that they are not really looking at all the issues that they are seeing in the media. I have been doing a lot of outreach to young people in the last year, and in the last few weeks, I have seen a lot more attention to the issues than I have ever seen in my whole career.

Deaton: I think that's right. I think that's a good turn of events. I think that's a sign of a lot of the things that I have been saying. It is an indication that people, particularly young people are looking at the world in a different way than they have in the past.

MarketWatch: What are some of those things?

Deaton: I think that the last couple of decades have been pretty dire for women. A lot of women are working longer hours at lower wages. I mean, one of the things that has been getting a lot of press lately is that after a long period of decline in the wages for men, women's wages have started to go up. I think that's a pretty big deal.

I think that you see a lot of other trends in the economy that are really concerning for the white working class. I mean, I think the biggest one is that median household income is not growing. That is a real problem. I think we are in the midst of a long, long period of stagnation in wealth, and a lot of people are finding themselves in dire straits in terms of their savings. I think that is a big deal. I think that other things that are worrying young people are the financialization of the economy and the fact that a lot of the wealth is not being passed down to the next generation. I think that is a big issue for these young people.

I think that the economy is not doing well. I think the stock market is a little bit better than it was last year. I think that there is a lot of uncertainty in the markets. I think that the housing market is a little bit better than it was in the past. I think that it is a little bit scarier than a year ago. I think that a lot of people are feeling a little bit of uncertainty but that doesn't mean that they are going to stay in that uncertainty. I think they are going to move forward with it. I think they are going to be optimistic.

MarketWatch: Do you think that that will translate into a countervailing force?

Deaton: I think so. I think that we need to start thinking about a new kind of politics and a new kind of economy. I think that we need to think about a new kind of politics and a new kind of economy. I think that we need to think about a new kind of politics and a new kind of economy.

MarketWatch: What do you mean by a new kind of politics?

MarketWatch: I want to make the bridge from your findings to the economy. You have said that white working class workers are facing a loss of their way of life.

Deaton: This is much more hypothetical because of course, you are saying "what
==================== COMPLETION 436 ====================
 is my jobs going to look like in the next 5 years?" But these trends do seem to be going in that direction with the increasingly precarious nature of employment. And I think that this is going to exacerbate the economic challenge that the white working class is saying, "we don't know what is going to happen to our jobs."

MarketWatch: Do you have any advice for people looking for work?

Deaton: There is no magic bullet. There are things that the government can do, like creating more jobs. But there are things that the private sector can do as well. And we are seeing this in the manufacturing sector a lot, particularly in the auto industry. And we are seeing this in the construction sector as well. Don't be afraid to go out and invest in improving your own skills, because the skills you need are going to be in demand.

MarketWatch: Where does the rise of the white working class fit into the broader narrative of America's changing demographics?

Deaton: White working class people are a much more important demographic than they have been in the past. They have the lion's share of the decline in the labor force participation rate. It is a much more significant problem for the white working class than for African-Americans and Hispanics. But at the same time, they have the most potential for growth. And that is something that the government can help with by encouraging them to get more education.

MarketWatch: My sense is that the white working class is a very vulnerable group because they are more economically insecure, and they are more reliant on government assistance. It's a big burden on their family.

Deaton: Yes, they are more vulnerable than the average American. Most Americans who are not college educated have a greater security than they do. So they are a much more fragile group than they were.

MarketWatch: So let's say that the white working class is not going to grow as rapidly as you would like and that's going to limit their ability to support a large family. What are the long-term implications of that?

Deaton: That's a big question. And I think the answer to that is, of course, it's possible that there will be a reversal of some of this progress. I mean, the data we have is that if you look at the rate of decline in the labor force participation rate, it is very slow. So we are not seeing a big decline. But I think the bigger question is, are they going to be able to support a family?

MarketWatch: In terms of the economic and political climate, how do you see that playing out?

Deaton: I think that it is going to be a challenge. I think that the Trump administration, especially on the trade front, is making it more difficult for American companies to invest overseas. So I think that's going to be a challenge.

MarketWatch: What do you say to people who say that these numbers and trends are simply a statistical artifact, that there are lots of factors that are also playing a role in the rise in some of these diseases?

Deaton: I think it is very important to look at the facts. I think that there are a lot of factors that play a role in these trends, but I think it is very important to look at the facts.

MarketWatch: Let me ask you this: Are America's white working class actually more racist than the general population?

Deaton: I don't think so. We don't have data that say we are. It's possible that we are. I think that there was a study done that looked at the counties where whites had a higher rate of

By Glen Stanish


September 11, 2001, much like December 7, 1941, is a day that will live in infamy. The post 9-11 period is one of the saddest times in American history. It has, however, provided the American people a slow and painful awakening of sorts.


As an airline pilot for American Airlines, the attacks of 9-11 hit very close to home. I was in the middle of a four-day trip on a layover in downtown Fort Worth on 9-11. Like many Americans that day, I woke up to the news of the devastating attacks. And, like most Americans, for a brief period after the attacks I was in a state of shock and awe.


Very shortly after the attacks we were informed by our elected leaders and the media that we had been attacked by Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaida because they didn't like our freedoms. Simple enough, but lacking a plausible political motive. For those who think a bit further than what we're told and deeper about the causes of war - greed in a word - this explanation was hard to accept. It was as if President George W. Bush had given us a square peg, and no matter how hard we tried,
==================== COMPLETION 437 ====================
 we could not make a round hole.


As time passed the attacks seemed more and more likely. They became more and more shocking. And, as time passed, we did not become more and more angry. Instead, we became more and more confused.


Where is Osama Bin Laden? What is Al Qaida? Why is this happening? The answers to these questions remain unknown. Even though the attacks were not faked, the government has continued to hide the truth.


In some cases the government has even gone so far as to admit that the attacks may have been an inside job. Somebody is trying to frame us. A conspiracy theory has begun to take hold about the attacks.


As I tried to come to grips with the attacks of September 11, 2001, I took solace in one of the simplest rules of life. "Nothing in this world is as it seems." We know that now.


As an American, I know that terrorism does not exist. That it has never existed. It is an invention of the government for their own purposes. But, as a pilot, I know that terrorists can strike at any time. And, as a pilot, I know that the United States can defend itself.


And, as a pilot, I would not let my guard down. Because, when I was experiencing the events of September 11, 2001, I had no intention of letting my guard down.


And, as a fighter pilot, I knew that the United States would not allow Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaida to strike at America's heart, the United States of America.


I will tell you why. Because in the heart of every American, there is a part of them that knows that al Qaeda never attacked America. Al Qaida never attacked America because there are no airports in Afghanistan. Al Qaida attacked America because we did not attack Afghanistan. Al Qaida attacked America because we did not attack Iraq. Al Qaida attacked America because we did not attack Afghanistan. Al Qaida attacked America because we were too busy with Iraq.


The United States has been attacked many times before. These attacks have been perpetrated by many different nations. Why is it that we have not been attacked by al Qaeda?


Throughout the world, there are those who wish to do us harm. I am here to tell you that they will not succeed. Can you name me one time that the United States has been attacked? Can you name a time that the United States has been attacked because we did not attack a country?


Here is what I know. The United States of America will always have the power to defend itself. And, therefore, America will never allow another attack on the United States of America.


I want to be clear. This is not a war on terror. The United States of America will not be intimidated. We are not going to allow a tiny minority of terrorists to destroy the liberties and security of this nation.


Since September 11, 2001, we have been under attack by those who wish to do us harm. But we have never been under attack by an enemy that is as wide spread and as sophisticated as al Qaeda.


Al Qaeda has repeatedly attacked America on a global scale. Al Qaeda has attacked America at home. Al Qaeda has attacked America on the streets of New York. Al Qaeda has attacked America in our airports. Al Qaeda has attacked America in our financial centers. Al Qaeda has attacked America in our schools, in our shopping malls, in our movie theaters, in our places of worship, in our streets and in our schools.


Al Qaeda has attacked America on American soil.


And, most recently, Al Qaeda has attacked America in our embassies.

September 11, 2001, much like December 7, 1941, is a day that will live in infamy. The post 9-11 period is one of the saddest times in American history. It has, however, provided the American people a slow and painful awakening of sorts.


As an airline pilot for American Airlines, the attacks of 9-11 hit very close to home. I was in the middle of a four-day trip on a layover in downtown Fort Worth on 9-11. Like many Americans that day, I woke up to the news of the devastating attacks. And, like most Americans, for a brief period after the attacks I was in a state of shock and awe.


Very shortly after the attacks we were informed by our elected leaders and the media that we had been attacked by Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaida because they didn't like our freedoms. Simple enough, but lacking a plausible political motive. For those who think a bit further than what we're told and deeper about the causes of war - greed in a word - this explanation was hard to accept. It was as if President George W. Bush had given us a square peg, and no matter how hard we tried,
==================== COMPLETION 438 ====================
 we couldn't find a round one.


As Americans we are conditioned to believe that the international community will come to our rescue. We are encouraged to believe that the United Nations is the answer to any problem, but when the United States chooses war, the international community is cut off from the American people.


One of the most frustrating things about 9-11 is that we never got to the bottom of why this attack occurred. The only conclusion we were left with was that Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaida had a bomb that went off on the World Trade Center.


The most disturbing thing about 9-11 was that the big U.S. newspaper chains, television networks and newspapers published false and biased information.


The story of the World Trade Center, despite the fact that it was a built-in, built-in target for an attack, was not told. We never learned that a special team of the Department of Defense was on the scene of the WTC the day of the attack. Nor was the story told that the WTC was one of the most highly fortified buildings in the world. We didn't learn that its steel frame was made of over 3,000 tons of steel, that it had over 8 million rivets holding it together, that it was the tallest building in the world at 541 feet, or that it was connected to the Manhattan Subway system and the Pentagon through a single elevator.


We never learned that the Twin Towers were constructed of over 100 million bricks, that the WTC was one of the most heavily guarded buildings in the world, that it was connected to the airport with a single belt system, that it was connected to the New York City subway system, that it was connected to the Pentagon through a single elevator, that it was connected to the White House through a single elevator, that it was connected to the CIA, FBI and Secret Service, and that it was a three-story building.


We don't even know if the planes that hit the towers were manned or not. The official government story, that this was an act of terrorism, was never told.


Some people believe that the CIA and military have been involved in some form of cover-up. Others believe that there is a more sinister explanation.


Many of us are very confused about what really happened on 9-11, and we are beginning to realize that there are two separate stories that are not being told.


One story that we are being told is that the United States invaded Afghanistan in order to find Osama Bin Laden. As we now know the attack did not result in any Bin Laden or Al Qaida members. But it did result in the death of thousands of innocent people.


Some people believe that Osama Bin Laden is still alive and living in a safe house in Pakistan. He is also believed to be behind the recent attacks in France, Denmark, Norway and England. So, the truth of the matter is that there are two stories, both of which are very disturbing.


The other story is that the United States invaded Afghanistan in order to serve the interests of the oil industry. In order to have a stable oil producing country like Afghanistan, the United States must have a stable government. That stable government must have control over the oil and gas resources that are located there.


The United States has been at war in Afghanistan since October of 2001. The war has caused over a million refugees to flee the country. Many have died as a result of the war.


The war has also caused the potential for the United States to become a major oil producing country.


The United States has been using the U.S. military to attack Afghanistan in order to serve the interests of the oil industry. This is the story that we are being

September 11, 2001, much like December 7, 1941, is a day that will live in infamy. The post 9-11 period is one of the saddest times in American history. It has, however, provided the American people a slow and painful awakening of sorts.

Like many Americans that day, I woke up to the news of the devastating attacks. And, like most Americans, for a brief period after the attacks I was in a state of shock and awe.


Very shortly after the attacks we were informed by our elected leaders and the media that we had been attacked by Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaida because they didn't like our freedoms. Simple enough, but lacking a plausible political motive. For those who think a bit further than what we're told and deeper about the causes of war - greed in a word - this explanation was hard to accept. It was as if President George W. Bush had given us a square peg, and no matter how hard we tried,
==================== COMPLETION 439 ====================
 we were unable to put a round peg into it.


In those early days after the attacks, the obvious answer was to defend our freedoms. This is the basic and bedrock principle and purpose of The Constitution. We fought two world wars to defend it. We fought a war in Viet Nam to protect it. And we defended our liberties by upholding the Bill of Rights.


After the 9-11 attacks, however, a different question began to occupy the minds of many Americans: are we defending our freedoms or defending Islam?


Oops.


Many Americans, particularly the young, began to believe that we were fighting for something that we didn't care about - freedom. The attacks of 9-11 were blamed not only on those evil Muslims who wanted to kill us, but on our freedom-loving government for allowing this to happen. And, in many cases, we were told that freedom is just another word for security, and in fact, that freedom is the greatest threat to national security.


This belief, which was widespread throughout the American population, was not only misguided, but it was detrimental to our nation as a whole. American Muslims have been fighting hard to protect our freedoms. We've been fighting them for a long time. It has been a long and difficult fight. Conservative Muslims have fought for our freedoms both during the cold war and during the "war on terror" in the Middle East.


Even in the face of a violent attack on our freedom, we must never forget that we are a nation of immigrants.


Our founding fathers, who were refugees and immigrants, knew that freedom is not a gift granted by government, but a gift that we have earned through our hard labors. We must always remember that.


We must remember that our freedom comes from God. God gave us this freedom in the Constitution, and He will not abandon us.


And, more than anything, we must never forget the message of that Constitution.


The Constitution is the eternal, living document that sets the boundaries of our liberty, and it is the most powerful weapon that we have to defend it. The Constitution was not written for the New World, but for the Old, and it was written to protect every American's right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.


The Constitution is the most powerful weapon that we have to defend it.


And, in this new century, the Constitution must be upheld.


"God Willing and Able to Provide,"


and "We the People"


The Constitution provides these fundamental rights to every American. It was designed, after all, for a time when our freedom was under threat from a tyrannical government that would one day become evil and corrupt. In the New World, the Constitution was the tool that we used to defend ourselves, our families and our nation.


The Constitution was designed to provide a way to preserve our freedom.


The Constitution sets the boundaries of our liberty. The Constitution is the most powerful weapon that we have to defend it.


It is our job to defend the Constitution. It is our job to defend the Bill of Rights. And, it is our job to defend the Bill of Rights by voting for and by serving our elected officials.


It is our job to defend our freedoms. It is our job to protect our rights. And, it is our job to defend our freedoms by serving our elected officials.


And, it is our job to defend the Constitution.


And, it is our job to defend our freedoms.


It is our job to defend our freedoms.


And, it is our job to protect our rights.


It is our job to defend our freedoms.

Like many Americans that day, I woke up to the news of the devastating attacks. And, like most Americans, for a brief period after the attacks I was in a state of shock and awe.


Very shortly after the attacks we were informed by our elected leaders and the media that we had been attacked by Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaida because they didn't like our freedoms. Simple enough, but lacking a plausible political motive. For those who think a bit further than what we're told and deeper about the causes of war - greed in a word - this explanation was hard to accept. It was as if President George W. Bush had given us a square peg, and no matter how hard we tried,
==================== COMPLETION 440 ====================
 we were unable to turn that peg over into a round one.


It took a while for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan to be revealed as the false pretexts for the invasion of Afghanistan. The media and the politicians rushed to blame the attacks on Saddam Hussein and Al Qaida. That didn't fit the story either. So, we were told that the chief problem with the 9-11 attacks was that they were carried out by incompetent people, and that they were carried out by al-Qaeda in order to justify the invasion of Afghanistan. The true story is that the 9-11 attacks were carried out by a group of people within the U.S. government who were in a position to prevent the attacks from occurring, but chose not to.


We are also told that the attacks were an inside job. That George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld orchestrated the attacks, and that the "war on terror" was a response to the attacks. They lied. They knew they were lying, but they didn't care. They were used. The false narrative has been adopted by the Bush administration. It is the basis of their foreign policy. It is the basis of their domestic policy. It is the basis of many of their actions. It is the basis of many of their lies.


It is difficult to know where to start and where to stop in examining the lies and ineptitude of the Bush administration. To help us in our inquiry, I offer a list of nine lies and nine false statements that are being told by the Bush administration.


1. "We did not know that the hijackers were planning an attack on our country."


The truth is that we knew as soon as we received the first reports that the attacks were underway. It was reported that the first plane hit the Pentagon. It was reported that the second plane hit the World Trade Center. It was reported that the third plane hit the Pentagon. We knew that they were preparing to attack our country.


The beginning of the real 9-11 investigation was done by a former federal prosecutor, Lee Hamilton, who worked for the Department of Justice. Hamilton's reports, as well as the testimony of many other witnesses, confirmed that the Bush administration knew of the 9-11 attacks before they occurred.


2. "We don't know who the hijackers were, and we don't know why they did it."


The truth is that we do know who the hijackers were, and we do know why they did it. We know that it was an inside job. We know that the hijackers were trained and directed by a group within the U.S. government. We know that the hijackers were led to the U.S. by two of their Saudi handlers. We know that the hijackers were trained by the CIA.


We know that the hijackers were directed by a group within the CIA called Able Danger. We know that Able Danger identified the hijackers within weeks of the attacks. We know that Able Danger identified the hijackers before the Department of Justice. We know that the CIA had been monitoring the phone calls of the hijackers, and that the CIA had been tracking their movements.


We know that the hijackers had trained at a base in Virginia, and that the base had been identified by the FBI as a training location for hijackers. We know that the hijackers had been living in Florida, and that the FBI had been monitoring their activities there. We know that the hijackers had been wearing uniforms with the insignia of the U.S. military. We know that the hijackers had been receiving training in Bulgaria, and that the Bulgarian military had been tracking their activities. We know that the hijackers had been recruited by

There was a noise that sounded like the sailor tripping over something for once, and Anna quickly reached out a useless hand into the darkness. Surprisingly, though there was no further disruption of her footsteps, a quick squeeze found its way to Anna's fingertips.

Taking that as permission to continue, Anna did so, ticking the names off her warm fingers.

"Or, you know, Hoarfrost Hearse, Ice Demon, Winter Scourge—Snowball Scoundrel." She paused. "Hurricane Hustler."

"That is not a real title."

Anna bit her bottom lip, grinning. "It is," she confirmed.

A pained silence filled the cool night air. Now in very good humor, and high on the success of narrowly avoiding another rock, Anna gleefully continued the conversation.

"So were you the one to teach your cabin boy how to draw those snowflakes?"

"Olaf taught himself," the sailor said, sounding so embarrassed that Anna wished they were doing this during the middle

 of the night. "I was just following his lead."

"What happened?" Anna asked, her smile growing.

"He got way too close," the sailor said, sounding somewhat sheepish.

"And he screamed," Anna said, trying to make it sound as if the other woman was being silly.

"And I said, 'don't touch me, I'm a pirate' and went after him," the sailor said, her voice growing soft. "And then he ran away, and I think I lost the whistle."

Anna was surprised at the sudden change in tone. "You lost the whistle?"

"Yes," the sailor said, shrugging. "But I didn't know that at the time."

"Are you saying you were going to go after him?"

The sailor shook her head. "No, I wasn't."

Anna shifted her weight in the dark, trying to avoid the sudden thud of something heavy hitting the ground. "And you are saying you didn't want to be caught?"

"Was I going to catch him?" the sailor said, her voice wavering, like she was trying to find the right word.

Anna leaned closer, her fingers curling into a fist. "You were going after him."

"I was," the sailor said, her voice breaking again. "I was going to keep him from getting away."

Anna's fist tightened. "You were going to take him down."

"I was."

"He was going to try and kill you."

"He was," the sailor agreed. "He was trying to kill me."

"And what did you do?"

The sailor jerked her head in the direction of the fire. "I became a pirate."

"A pirate?" Anna asked, raising an eyebrow. "Why did you decide to become a pirate?"

"Because I was the best at it," the sailor said, coming to a stop right in front of Anna.

"Oh?" Anna asked, almost incredulous. "What do you mean by that? You were a good pirate, weren't you?"

"I was," the sailor said, her voice sounding so hollow.

"But you didn't have a ship, you didn't have a crew, you just went out and boarded and attacked ships?" Anna asked, hoping that if she was lucky, she wouldn't be the only one to feel this way.

"Well," the sailor said, throwing her head back and laughing at herself. "I never knew what to do with a crew. I hated them."

"You were a pirate!" Anna shouted, finally getting over the shock of the pirate's confession.

The sailor's laughter sounded like a bellow, echoing in the darkness. "I was a pirate, and I had a ship and I hunted pirates."

"But you didn't have a crew, and you didn't know how to fight."

"I didn't know how to fight," the sailor said, throwing her head back and laughing again. "I just had a crew, and I was happy with that."

Anna's fists tightened, her head swimming.

"This is funny," she said, trying to keep herself from laughing again.

"This is not funny," the sailor said, her voice cracking. "I was a pirate."

"What did you do?"

"I killed people. I killed pirates."

Anna felt tears welling in her eyes, and she felt suddenly ill. "If you killed pirates, why did you save me?"

"Neither have I," Anna said cheerfully. "But I'm getting ahead of myself. He's been drawing them since we first got here. He's really good at it."

"He is?"

"That's what they say."

Anna grinned. "Oh, Olaf does have an eye for a good face."

"I have to agree," the sailor said. "He's a good boy."

"I like your hair," Anna said, and the sailor looked at her in surprise.

"Your hair?"

"The way it just kind of rolls down your back on the breeze," Anna said, and the sailor grinned. "Sorry, I don't have a head for that kind of thing. I've been a sailor for a long time, and I've seen enough to know that you don't exactly need one."

"It's on purpose?"

"It's purposely long and curly," Anna said, and the sailor laughed.

"You're not one of them."

"I am. I mean, I've seen plenty of them, of course, but the ones I've seen up close are...different. They're more...fierce."

"I wonder if he's ever had a fight with you?"

"Yes, and he won," Anna said. "But not often."

"What did he win?"

"I don't know," Anna said. She looked down at the sailor's feet. "He won a game of cards."

"I see," the sailor said. "And when did you win?"

"When I was a kid," Anna said. "I was a terrible poker player back then. I was always losing."

"I see," the sailor said. "And you're very good, I see."

"I am, I think. And I've won a lot of money. But I know I can't beat you at poker. And I'm not even good enough to get into the tournaments. Because you're Elsa, and I'm not. So I've never even tried."

"So we do have a deal," the sailor said.

Anna smiled. "Well, a deal's a deal. And there's another thing I have to ask you."

"What is it?"

"I want you to marry me."

The sailor blinked. "Are you crazy?"

"I am," Anna said. "But this is my chance. I've been waiting for this my whole life, and I may not even be able to do it until I'm twenty-five."

"I'm not getting married until I'm twenty-five," the sailor said. "I don't know anything about you."

"I know everything about you, I do." The sailor's eyes widened. "You're a pirate, right? And you're sexy."

Anna laughed. "I'm not your type, but I'm a good dancer. And I can tell what you like. I'm almost sure that you like me."

"Please don't," the sailor said. "I don't want to ruin what we have. I've been a sailor for twenty-three years, and I've met some pretty nice people—and then you come along, and you're going to ruin everything."

"I'll ruin it," Anna said, and she could not help but smile, despite the sailor's protests. "And I'm going to enjoy it."

"Well, I think we've all learned a lesson or two from Olaf."

"You're the one who taught me how to draw all those snowflakes."

"I had to use my own hands, and I really didn't want to see him be so embarrassed by the process."

Anna felt herself smile again, and she didn't really want to stop. At least until the door opened and Elsa entered, looking at her with a bit of a frown. "Anna?"

"Yes?" Anna asked, smiling even bigger.

"Are you girls still going to stay here?"

"Yes!" Anna asked, eagerly. "We're staying here!"

"Well, don't let me keep you from your friends."

"Oh, no!" Anna said, practically bouncing up and down. "I didn't know you were friends with Elsa! I mean, I know she's a wuss—"

"Oh, I'm not a wuss!" Elsa cut in. "I'm just a good sister."

"Oh, well, we're sure you'll be fine!" Anna said, giving the two an encouraging smile.

"It's your turn to be a wuss, Anna," Elsa said, sharply.

Anna giggled. "Oh, really?"

Elsa looked at her curiously. "Hmm, I thought so. Are you sure you don't want to spend the night?"

Anna handed her a small box. "I'm not sure if that's really a good idea," she said, "but Elsa, you'll probably never see this again."

Elsa saw the small box, and she opened it. Inside was a small, purple and pink, hand-made box. Anna immediately recognized it as one of Anna's favorites.

Elsa's eyes widened as she recognized the box. "I'm so happy you found it!" She gave it to Anna, and Anna immediately tossed it to her, trying not to cry in delight.

Elsa rolled her eyes. "Well, it was worth a try," she said. "You've already made a good impression on your shipmates, and I think you'll do well in the future."

"Elsa, I'm going to be a good shipmate!" Anna said, waving her hand in the air.

"Well, I don't think you're going to keep that promise."

Anna threw her hands in the air. "I don't care! I'm going to be a good shipmate! Elsa, have you ever wanted to hold a snowflake? Now you can!"

Elsa shook her head. "No, I haven't."

"Well then, I guess you'll have to hold me!" Anna said to Elsa, who was still staring at her with a quizzical expression on her face.

"Anna, does it really matter?"

"Of course it does! I'm going to be your shipmate!"

Elsa gave a small smile. "I'm sure you will."

Anna grinned back. "You know, I'm really glad I asked you to stay over. I think it'll be a little awkward if we don't get to know each other."

Elsa laughed, and Anna felt a bit of a blush rise on her face. "Well, I'm really glad you asked me to stay, too."

The two girls shared a soft smile, and then the door opened again, and Elsa and Kristoff entered. The two of them had been engaged in a quiet conversation, and Anna was glad that they had been able to do that without having to hear

"And what did you teach him?"

"I'll tell you when I teach him again."

"Did you teach him how to draw everything?"

The sailor shook her head. "Olaf doesn't draw anything, Anna. He's just a silly kid."

"Oh."

"Yes," said the sailor, "but he was good at writing, so I taught him how to write too."

Anna was silent for a moment, contemplating.

"What have you decided to do with Olaf?"

"Hm?"

"Will you marry him?"

"No."

"Then what?"

"I don't know."

"Anna, you're not going to marry him."

"I know."

"So why don't you just wait until you're older, and then you'll figure it out?"

"I don't know."

"Do you have a date for the day he turns eighteen?"

"No."

"Then by all means, wait until then."

"So when are you going to ask him out?"

The sailor sighed. "I don't know."

"I'm going to ask him out tomorrow."

"Tomorrow!"

"Tomorrow."

"I can't wait."

"I can't wait either."

"I'll wait."

"I'll wait."

"I'm going to ask him out, I'm going to ask him out, I'm going to ask him out, don't you know that?"

The sailor's voice softened. "Anna, I'm sorry."

Anna smiled. "It's okay, it's okay."

"I'll be waiting."

And with that, if Anna had known it would be this easy, she would have asked for thirty minutes more.

"I'm sorry," the sailor said again, "I'm sorry that I didn't know."

"No, it's fine. You're not at fault. You're just a very young sailor."

Anna laughed. She loved a quick laugh.

"I hope you have a lot more fun tomorrow."

"Tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow," the sailor repeated, "I promise."

"I promise."

"I love you, Anna."

Anna reached out to touch the sailor's hand, but found that she couldn't reach. She didn't know what it was. Maybe it was because she had lost her finger when she was young, but she had been keeping it quite covered up. The sailor's hand was slick with snow and ice, and it was cold. Not to mention, Anna didn't know why she was holding the hand of this sailor from another time.

"I love you too."

In the darkness, Anna could hear the sailor's voice. She could taste her.

Anna's hand was cold.

Anna was brightening when she heard the sailor say, "Sapphire's going to be here in a minute."

"Yes, well, you can wait."

"I can wait."

Anna could still feel the sailor's warm breath on her lips.

"I mean, I can wait."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean I'm sure you don't want to hear about Sapphire."

The sailor leaned back against the fireplace. "I want to hear about Sapphire."

"Really, Sapphire? You don't want to hear about

Important: given the way bash scripts handle quotes on parameters passed to them, if the new value you want to set for the property is a string you need to explicitly escape the quotes as in the example.

Note: this method is not the same as using the setter method which you can learn more about in the docs.

jyparser also provides several setters which allow you to set a property for an element with a string or number:

~ cat test.json | docker run -i --rm jlordiales/jyparser set ".menu.id" "new_id" { "menu" : { "id" : "new_id" , "value" : "File" , "popup" : { "menuitem" : [ { "value" : "New" , "onclick" : "CreateNewDoc()" } , { "value" : "Open" , "onclick" : "OpenDoc()" } , { "value" : "Close" , "onclick" : "CloseDoc()" } ] } } }

You can also use the setters to set a property on a container element:

~ cat test.json | docker run -i --rm jlordiales/jyparser set ".menu.id" "new_id" { "menu" : { "id" : "new_id" , "value" : "File" , "popup" : { "menuitem" : [ { "value" : "New" , "onclick" : "CreateNewDoc()" } , { "value" : "Open" , "onclick" : "OpenDoc()" } , { "value" : "Close" , "onclick" : "CloseDoc()" } ] } } }

jyparser also provides a helper method, set_from , which will set a property from an element:

~ cat test.json |
======================================== SAMPLE 446 ========================================
 the input and a new value to update that element to. The result is the original input with the value updated.

Important: given the way bash scripts handle quotes on parameters passed to them, if the new value you want to set for the property is a string you need to explicitly escape the quotes as in the example. Otherwise, jq will complain that the value is not valid (rightfully so). This is not needed for numbers or booleans. So the following works as expected:

If you want to use the current value of a property as the value to update it with, you can use the make() function.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Tuesday the rebels launched an offensive to sever supply lines and cut routes used by Syrian government forces to move troops and supplies to the coastal city of Latakia.

In a series of coordinated military maneuvers in the Sunni Muslim-populated province of Idlib, the rebels have attacked government positions and checkpoints, according to the monitoring group.

The offensive follows a three-week-old offensive that has seen government troops regain control of several rebel-held towns and villages in Latakia province.

The rebels have been largely focused on pushing government forces back from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front in the north, while the al-Qaeda affiliate in the coastal province has been on the defensive for months.

The offensive is likely to draw in a new wave of foreign fighters to the Syrian war, according to analysts.

"This is a new group of foreign fighters that are coming to Syria to fight the regime," said Andrew Tabler, a fellow at the Washington Institute who was an adviser to the rebel coalition.

The rebels are now fighting alongside forces including the Nusra Front and other Islamist groups, which have been increasingly targeting the Syrian government in recent months.

Rebels have been attacking Syrian government positions in the Idlib province, which is predominantly Sunni Muslim but also includes a significant Christian minority, since July.

On Tuesday, the rebel coalition said it had expanded the offensive "to cut the supply routes and several regime checkpoints" near the city of Idlib.

The offensive is likely to draw in a new wave of foreign fighters to the Syrian war, according to analysts.

"The foreign fighters from Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Tunisia, Lebanon and even Turkey have been coming in, in an exponential way," Tabler said.

However, he said the rebels have been unable to gain access to the coastal city of Latakia, and are instead concentrating their efforts in other areas.

The rebel alliance has also been trying to capture other areas in the Idlib province, Tabler said, including the town of Qusayr, which is controlled by the Nusra Front. The

tubal pregnancy", but ectopic pregnancies can occur, on rare occasions, in the ovary, around or behind the uterus, or in the cervix. There are various reasons why a fertilized egg can be blocked or slowed in the fallopian tube, to include a birth defect in the fallopian tubes, endometriosis (uterine lining tissue occurring in the fallopian tubes), complications caused by a ruptured appendix, and scarring from past infections or surgeries. The risk for ectopic pregnancies is significantly increased by age (over 35), in vitro fertilization, having multiple sexual partners, smoking, and getting pregnant while using certain intrauterine artificial contraception devices or after having a tubal ligation. Also reconstructive surgery to the fallopian tubes significantly increases the chances of an ectopic pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy is always a life-threatening condition to mother and child. Without the removal of the developing cells a rupture will occur, and the resulting hemorrhaging will kill the mother. Obviously, therefore, the baby cannot survive in such a condition, either. An ectopic pregnancy must be treated immediately in order to save the life of the mother, but the death of the unborn baby is always a consequence of all current ectopic pregnancy treatments. The Catholic Church
==================== COMPLETION 449 ====================
 has never officially declared that an ectopic pregnancy can be treated with medication or surgery. The Church has always taught that the life of the unborn baby is a gift from God to be protected and blessed (Catechism of the Catholic Church, no. 1763). Therefore, the medical care of ectopic pregnancies must always be based on this "gift" from God. We also have to take into consideration the fact that the life of the mother is not a gift to be protected and blessed. Abortion is a direct violation of the gift of life to the mother. Therefore, the medical care of ectopic pregnancies cannot be based on a "gift" from God. The Church's position on this issue has been clear since the year 1847. During the last century, the Church has changed its position on abortion. With the rise of the contraceptive technology, and with the discovery that the procedure had a devastating effect on the development of the child, the Church has changed its position on abortion to allow the use of contraceptives and to instruct couples to use them in order to avoid pregnancy. The Church has always taught that abortion is a grave sin (Catechism of the Catholic Church, no. 1765). The Church believes that the destruction of the embryo is the most serious evil possible, and a person who would destroy an innocent human life is a murderer. Therefore, the Church strongly condemns abortion. However, according to the criteria of the medical profession, only a small percentage of ectopic pregnancies can be handled successfully with medications. The most common ectopic pregnancy is one that occurs in the fallopian tubes. The Fallopian tubes are a series of tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus. When the fertilized egg implants in the ovary, the embryo spontaneously separates from the ovary and travels down the fallopian tube. Sometimes, the embryos detect these vessels and break through into the other end of the fallopian tube. These embryos are called ectopic. Ectopic pregnancies usually are not fatal, and most do not require surgery. However, there are cases that require a surgical procedure. The most common surgical procedure is a tubal ligation, which removes a small piece of the fallopian tube, and then a tubal procedure is performed to open the fallopian tubes, to remove the fertilized egg, to clean out the tubal lumen, and to repair the fallopian tube. If the fallopian tube is not cleaned out properly, the implantation of the fertilized egg will continue, and the resulting embryo will die. Sometimes, the fallopian tube is not ruptured with the tubal ligation. If this is the case, the embryo may remain in the fallopian tubes, which will grow in size and eventually burst. An ectopic pregnancy can be treated with medication or surgery to remove the embryo, or it can be treated with surgery to remove the fallopian tube and then the remaining embryos, depending on the degree of damage to the fallopian tubes from the surgery. In most cases, the treatment is done in the Fallopian tube. If the treatment is done in the Fallopian tube, the procedure is known as a tubal ligation. If the treatment is done in the ovary, the procedure is known as a tubal procedure. The most common medications used for ectopic pregnancies are methylfolate (whose active ingredient is pyrimethamine), and clomiphene citrate (which is a synthetic version of this medication). Other medications used during ectopic pregnancy treatment include succinate, methotrexate, and cyclosporine. Many doctors perform the surgery to remove the fertilized egg in the Fallopian tube. In some cases, the Fallopian tube may be left open. In the case of a tubal procedure, the implantation of

The Catholic Church
==================== COMPLETION 450 ====================
 does not take a position on whether an ectopic pregnancy is a good thing or not, but the church strongly discourages pregancies, IVF, and ART from using the fallopian tubes. Abortion: Although abortion is illegal in the United States, there are many factors that make it difficult to restrict abortion in other countries. It is illegal in all other countries, including Ireland, where the majority of women have abortions. The choice of whether or not a woman should have an abortion is a personal decision that is best made by the woman and her family. When a woman's life is in danger, she should be given the choice to have an abortion, and the law should protect her right to do so. The Catholic Church opposes all abortion. In the case of a medical emergency, the Catholic Church opposes abortion, as well. There is one in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure that is less invasive than a tubal ligation or a tubal ligation after an ectopic pregnancy. The procedure must be performed by a trained medical professional. This procedure is called "unilateral oophorectomy" because it is performed under local anesthesia. The reason for this is that the chemical that is put into the woman's body during the procedure can cause an abortion if the semen is not removed. There is one less invasive procedure called a hysterectomy, which has the same effect as a tubal ligation. The hysterectomy is also less invasive than a tubal ligation. The hysterectomy procedure is only performed if the woman's life is in danger. The Catholic Church opposes both medical abortions and hysterectomy. It believes that a woman's body has the right to determine whether or not she should have an abortion. The Catholic Church does not believe that a woman has the right to make her own decisions about her body. The Catholic Church believes that a woman has the right to make her own decisions about her health and her body. The Catholic Church believes that women have the right to make their own health decisions. The Catholic Church believes that to have a choice about their health is a fundamental human right. The Catholic Church believes that the state can and should regulate health care to help ensure that the reproductive health of women is met.

What are the ramifications of an abortion on an unborn child?

The unborn child in the womb experiences severe trauma. However, one of the most important aspects of the unborn child is his or her emotional development. This is the reason why the Catholic Church opposes abortion and the use of chemical abortion. The unborn child is completely dependent on his or her mother for survival. But, the child is also dependent on the mother for love, comfort, and understanding. Thus, when the mother is in an emotionally-distressing situation, she may inflict harm on her own child by causing him or her to experience harm. This is true even if that child is the result of incest. An emotionally-distressing situation can include a hospital visit, a long car ride, or an emotional crisis. Many women suffer from a miscarriage, and even if they recover, they may carry that miscarriage with them for the rest of their lives.

The Catholic Church
==================== COMPLETION 451 ====================
 has been very clear in its teaching on the issue of ectopic pregnancies and ectopic pregnancy treatment, and it has always been considered a serious, life-threatening condition. In fact, the Church's teaching on the matter has been in place since the fourth century, when the Church held that an ectopic pregnancy would always kill the mother, and that the baby would be born dead, with the result that all of the Church's prayers were in vain. The Church has always taught that if the pregnancy is not treated, the mother will die, and the baby will die. In past centuries, the Church has also taught that the baby would not survive if the mother was treated with drugs or surgery in an effort to treat the ectopic pregnancy. Since this is not the case today, the Church has no problem with the use of these methods to treat ectopic pregnancy.

In addition to ectopic pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy treatment includes the following:

Surgical removal of the endometriosis, if this is confirmed by ultrasound.

Surgical removal of the ectopic pregnancy, if this is confirmed by ultrasound.

Surgical removal of the ectopic pregnancy, if this is confirmed by ultrasound.

In vitro fertilization, if this is confirmed by ultrasound.

There are a number of ways in which ectopic pregnancies can be treated. In the case of ectopic pregnancy treatment, the majority of procedures may involve removal of a fertilized egg and its attached cells. Examples of these procedures include:

In addition to surgery, occiput (or endometrial ablation) and hysterectomy are also commonly used for ectopic pregnancy treatment.

A common mistake people make regarding ectopic pregnancy treatment is to assume that the endometrial lining is removed during the treatment. The endometrial lining, however, is not removed during the treatment. Essentially, the endometrial lining is left in place, but the endometrial cells are removed. This is not a surgical procedure.

The following procedures are only used to treat ectopic pregnancy. The treatment of ectopic pregnancy is not a "cure" for ectopic pregnancy, but it is a procedure that may be helpful in preventing future ectopic pregnancies.

Intrauterine insemination


Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is the process of fertilization between the male and the female in vitro by sperm. The sperm must be retrieved from the mother, and then transferred to the uterus of the mother using an IUI instrument. An IUI is done to avoid the possibility of pregnancy during the procedure. However, a pregnancy can occur in the mother, even if the IUI procedure is not successful. A woman can get pregnant

==================== COMPLETION 452 ====================
's position on ectopic pregnancy is clear: the individual should follow the medical advice and try to treat the problem immediately by terminating the pregnancy, and obtaining medical attention in a timely manner.

The Catholic Church has made a number of judgments on the morality of contraception, including:

Those who go to extremes in their attempts to avoid pregnancy or refrain from sexual relations, either for reasons of religious or moral conviction, are, in the Church's view, committing grave sin, even if they are not at present pregnant.

Those who use contraception in order to avoid the natural consequences of sexual relations (such as the failure of [oral] contraceptives to prevent the fertilization of an egg and the consequence of pregnancy) are also committing grave sin, if they are not pregnant.

Consequently, contraception is intrinsically evil and, therefore, contrary to the natural moral law.

In certain circumstances, it may be permissible to use contraceptives for moral reasons, provided that other methods of birth control are available.

And when you're out there and you're facing a, you know, line of police that are armed with assault rifles, there's an MRAP, there's whatever military—there's helicopters overhead, it is very scary. You think about what happens if someone just accidentally, you know, gets too excited and thinks that somehow, you know, maybe we're praying too hard or whatever it is, and they shoot. You know, that's how it feels when you're there. And the police are a scary presence.

It's not a comfortable feeling to know that you are actually afraid for your life from the police because they're protecting a pipeline and they're protecting the interests of Dakota Access. That's a very scary feeling, and it's one that I think, you know, more people need to be aware of. And they need to understand that we've reached a point now where we've got, you know, a state actively and openly protecting the interests of Big Oil, and we've got a Congress that's directly controlled.

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to turn to a clip from a Democracy Now! interview with a climate justice organizer. This is Carl Pope, who runs The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's Environmental Protection and Education Program.

CARL POPE: The way the pipeline is being constructed is destroying the only source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. They're not doing an environmental impact assessment. They're not taking the community's concerns into account. They're not doing any kind of cultural consultation. And they're doing this even though the pipeline is right next to a treaty reservation.

AMY GOODMAN: That's Carl Pope, coordinator for the Environmental Protection and Education Program at the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. He's a member of the Hunkpapa Lakota Nation. He's talking about the pipeline, the Dakota Access pipeline. This is Democracy Now! We'll be back in a minute.

AMY GOODMAN: "Winds of Change," by Tanya Tagaq. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, "Winds of Change" by Tanya Tagaq is in the current issue of Rolling Stone. Tagaq is an executive director for the Blackfeet Nation of Montana, is a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! We're speaking to Tanya Tagaq of the Blackfeet Nation. Tanya Tagaq, I wanted to ask you about this—this interview that you did with Rolling Stone. When you were interviewed, you were talking about the whole issue of—what's happening right now in North Dakota.

TANYA TAGAQ: Well, the main thing that's happening right now is—is that people are out there, and they're trying to protect their water and their sacred sites. And they're trying to protect their ancestors, their culture, and their way of life. And it's—there's been a lot of tension. There's been a lot of violence. But when you look at the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which is a sovereign nation, a nation-to-nation nation, they are very respected and very important. And they are an indigenous nation. They're indigenous people, and they're trying to protect their way of life and their land. And it's a very peaceful protest. And it's been peaceful.

AMY GOODMAN: And just talk about the response of the government, of the Obama administration, to the protests.

TANYA TAGAQ: Well, it's—it's—you know, it's been a long time. You know, it's been, like, eight months since the pipeline was approved in North Dakota. And I think that, you know, one of the reasons that it's been so long is because the Obama administration has been a bit slow in sending the pipeline construction equipment to North Dakota. And they're trying to get the—you know, the—the equipment into the ground.

And so, you know, we've seen this machinery. It's been there for eight months, and they're still trying to get it into the ground. And they're trying to get the pipe into the ground. And finally, we're getting the permit. And they're trying to get the pipeline in the ground, but the protestors are still out there. And that's what's stopping them.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And the significance of this?

AMY GOODMAN: I want to turn to another segment of the Democracy Now! interview with climate activist and scholar Bill McKibben. He spoke to us just a few days before the White House released its new climate plan, which includes a pledge to reduce carbon pollution by up to 28 percent by 2025. He says the Obama administration has taken a major step forward, but the real battle is ahead.

BILL McKIBBEN: I think it's important to keep in mind that if we don't get serious about tackling the problem of climate change now, it's going to be very difficult for us to do that later. We're going to have to get to a point in the next several decades where we're actually doing things that are going to make a difference, where we're actually doing something about climate change. And I think we're still a long way away from that.

AMY GOODMAN: That's Bill McKibben, on the new Obama plan to tackle climate change. I want to go now to another clip of that conversation. Democracy Now! producer Mike Burke, we're talking to Bill McKibben. We're having him on to talk about the significance of the Paris climate summit. And we'll be joined in the studio by our guests, Bill McKibben, Naomi Klein, and, also, Asawin Suebsaeng, from the Indigenous Environmental Network, who is in France, speaking out against what she calls the climate summit. So, Mike Burke, you're on the road in Chicago. You're speaking at the Union Institute of Chicago. Can you tell us what is happening in Chicago right now, Bill McKibben?

MIKE BURKE: So, Bill, I think what's happening in the city right now is they're all gearing up for this climate summit, and it's taking place in the same place. It's taking place at McCormick Place. So, you know, the climate summit is happening right now. And the other thing that's happening right now, what's really happening right now, you know, is that people are really mobilizing around this issue of climate change. You know, protesters are taking to the street, you know, in different cities around the world to oppose the conference. Asawin Suebsaeng is the head of the Indigenous Environmental Network, which is based in France, and she's speaking out against what she calls the climate summit.

The Cubs had the best record in the majors in each of the six seasons that have ended since the end of the World Series in 2004. They won their first World Series, in 1908, before their final championship, in 1945, and they won their last World Series, in 1924, before their last championship.

In those games, they swept the Cincinnati Reds, St. Louis Cardinals and the Philadelphia Phillies in four games, after the second of three straight World Series defeats for the Cubs in 1924.

The Cubs' dominance was the stuff of legend.

"It was like the Chicago Bears, who won their last championship in the summer of 1945, and that was the last championship they won in any sport," said Cincinnati Reds manager Dusty Baker, who managed the Cubs in 1924.

Baseball's greatest era began in Chicago. The Cubs moved into the city in 1883. The city had four major league teams at the time: the Chicago Bears, the Chicago or Chicago-White Sox, the Chicago Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs.

The two teams battled each other, with the Cubs winning the first game of the 1883 World Series, and the Bears winning the next three. The Cubs defeated the Cardinals in the World Series the next season, before the White Sox won it all in 1884.

The Cubs dominated the National League for many years, winning five pennants and sweeping the Chicago Pirates in the 1908 World Series.

The team's dominance continued after the turn of the century.

They won their first pennant in 1908, before losing it in 1910 to the Cubs' archrival, the Giants. The Cubs would win the National League pennant in 1911, the only time they won a pennant in the National League.

They won a second World Series in 1912, before losing it in 1915 to the Philadelphia Phillies. They would win their final World Series in 1916, before losing it in 1918 to the Cincinnati Reds.<|endoftext|>The cash-strapped human rights group has reported that more than 500 people have been killed in rebel-held areas in Syria since the start of the year, and a further 3,000 have been kidnapped by the regime.

The report, which focuses on the period from October to December, also notes that more than 7,500 people have been arrested, including 6,500 children, since the start of the conflict.

It also informs that 39 people have been executed by the regime, including a number of women and girls.

In the report, Human Rights Watch says: "A new wave of abuses in Syria's rebel-held areas has included unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and restrictions on basic freedoms.

"The government of Bashar al-Assad has also allegedly committed crimes against humanity in areas controlled by its opponents."

The UK-based group adds that the "disproportionate" death toll and systematic abuses in rebel-held areas have led to a deterioration in the "legal, human rights, and humanitarian situation" in Syria.

We've got—we've got a situation where we have a government that is, you know, fundamentally undermining the democratic process. And we've got—you know, we have an administration that is—is, you know, very much committed to the interests of the fossil fuel industry. So, you know, right now, it's a situation in which the United States is not providing the leadership that the rest of the world needs. And the rest of the world needs leadership.

And the people in the rest of the world need to understand that we're not going to get anywhere in our fight for a sustainable future unless we get a lot of support from the rest of the world. So, this is a global struggle. It's not a just a local struggle. It's not a fight against the police or against the pipeline. It's a fight for a better future. And the United States needs to leave behind a model that is economically and environmentally destructive and that is a special interest that is not serving the interests of the American people.

AMY GOODMAN: Joe Stiglitz and Naomi Klein, your book, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate. Naomi, we're going to continue what you were saying. Naomi Klein, your response?

NAOMI KLEIN: You know, I think that Joe is absolutely right. And I think that what is happening is—we have—right now, what we have is a rerun of the history of climate change, which was already happening before the fossil fuel industry came onto the scene. And you know, the fossil fuel industry was the one that was really the first to profit off of the crisis of climate change, because they were the first to start digging up oil, to extract oil. And, you know, the fossil fuel industry is a—you know, it's a very—it's a very, very powerful interest. And it's going to be a very powerful interest—it's not just the fossil fuel industry. You know, it's the shipping industry and the coal industry. It's the transportation industry. It's the power companies. It's the banking industry. And so, the fossil fuel industry has, you know, been the one that has been driving this. And we have a situation now where the fossil fuel industry is not only making huge profits, but they're also trying to make sure that the public school children of the United States, you know, are not going to have access to clean water. You know, we have a situation now where the fossil fuel industry is attacking the public schools—

 The crowd of two thousand, packed into a high-school gymnasium, cheered as Obama denounced the "anti-government, anti-immigrant, anti-trade" agenda of Trump and the Republican Party. On Monday, a few hours before the Associated Press declared that Clinton had secured enough delegates to win the nomination, the Times reported that Clinton advisers and the White House were in "active conversations" about how to deploy the President on the campaign trail. But the President, for his part, has already deployed himself.

Elkhart was a reminder of just how effective Obama is on the stump. And his rising approval rating—now at fifty-one per cent, up six points since January, according to Gallup—has increased expectations that he'll send some of his likability in Clinton's direction (and save a little for the rest of the Democratic slate across the country). Last week, on the Web site The Ringer, Obama's former speechwriter, Jon Favreau, described the President as the star player on her "Democratic Dream Team." Chuck Todd, of NBC, has predicted that Obama will serve as Clinton's chief "character witness." Others have suggested that Obama will focus on the economy, as he did in Elkhart, or on baiting

 Trump. "The President wants to be a foil to Donald Trump, trying to make him feel comfortable saying things that are not true," a former senior official said. It's a tactic that worked in 2008, when Obama and John McCain, then the Republican nominee, tangled over the state of the economy and Obama's birthplace. "It's one reason why he's so good at this—he's got the ability to make people feel good about things that aren't true," the former senior official said.

But Obama is also a political maverick, and he's going to have to decide whether to deploy his political skills to counter Trump's anti-establishment appeal or stick to the messaging of his own campaign. To do the latter, he will find himself frequently adopting Trump's style of political attack. As Obama said in Elkhart, he also knows that he will have to answer for his own record, and that the "integrity" of his Presidency will be put to the test if he does so.

There are at least two paths he can take. The first is to pretend that Clinton's nomination is inevitable, and to "let her do her thing." This might be the most politically damaging route, since it would make Clinton the Democrats' "presumptive nominee," a status that would make the President's policies irrelevant, especially when it comes to immigration, trade, and Wall Street regulation. But it could also help Clinton win over some of Obama's many disillusioned liberal supporters. The second path is the one he seems most likely to take: to embrace the populist anti-Trump agenda that has been shaping up in the Republican Party.

Obama has a history of jumping on the bandwagon of the anti-Trump forces. In March, after Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists," Obama proclaimed, "We're going to have to start treating each other with respect." He was rebutted by Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who said, "The President doesn't get it, or he gets it better than anybody understands, which is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn Mexican-origin judge."

The President has already signaled that he intends to oppose Trump on some of his most controversial issues: the ban on Muslims entering the country, for example. But he could also try to find common ground with the candidate. As Obama said in Elkhart, the President knows that "if Republicans are serious about being a party that speaks to the aspirations and the dreams of working people, that is the party that I want to be a part of."

Trump, for his part, would certainly welcome the opportunity to court Obama's anti-establishment supporters. But he could have a hard time making Obama his connection. Obama was never Obama to the left of Clinton on such issues as trade and immigration, but he has often been willing to work with the Republican base: For example, in 2014, he agreed to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that is popular with the Tea Party and which Trump opposes.

The Trump campaign has already signaled that it would like to work with the President. Now that Trump is likely to be the Republican nominee, one of his top advisers, Roger Stone, told the Breitbart News Network, "I think you can work with him, because he's not a socialist, he's a Republican." But Stone cautioned that any progress on immigration or trade would be contingent on Trump winning the Presidency. "We're going to have to start treating each other with respect," Stone said. "That's what this country is based on, and it's what the President will fight for."

Trump also has a history of trying to work with Democrats. In 2000, he won the Republican nomination by casting

 Trump, who has called Obama "the worst President in the history of our country." The Times, in its editorial, described Obama's mission as "a series of speeches about the Democratic Party that will help Clinton win the Presidency."

Obama's campaign advisers, however, are not holding their breath. "He's not going to go out and do some kind of disconcerting thing," Dan Pfeiffer, Obama's former communications director, told me. "He's not going to go out and look like a dour, doltish, out-of-touch guy. He's going to go out there saying, 'I'm really excited about this, I'm really excited about this, I'm really excited about this.' "

That's why Obama's advisers are convinced that Clinton will need him. Although they acknowledge that Obama is not the same person as he was on the campaign trail, they see him as a sort of substitute. "We're in a new world," Pfeiffer said. "I think he's a much more appealing figure than he was in 2008, and he's an appealing figure in the Democratic Party, because he's a person who is not a politician—and is not offering a diagnosis of the problem."

Obama has spent the past few weeks rehearsing a series of speeches that he has intended to deliver in the coming weeks, at rallies in Pennsylvania and Ohio and in the battleground states of Virginia and Florida. Obama began this process in earnest, according to a White House official, last Friday, when he received a briefing on Trump's campaign and was briefed by his senior political adviser, David Axelrod. The official said that Obama was "very concerned about the potential for disarray and chaos." "He was very much taken aback by the campaign," the official added. "He was appalled by the fact that Trump was continuing to attack the Khan family, attack the Khan family, and attack the Khans over and over, and that his supporters were responding in kind."

Obama began by revisiting the 2008 primary, when he campaigned for Clinton and came under attack from Barack Obama, who had emerged as her rival. "I know that some of you have never forgotten 2008," Obama told the crowd in Elkhart. "I know that some of you have never forgotten the first time we worked together, and I know that some of you have never forgotten the last time we worked together. We were in the middle of a war. The Democratic Party was in the middle of a tough battle. And every day, I believe, we had to push back and we had to keep fighting. And we had to keep working together... what we did then is what we have to do again. We have to keep working together."

Obama's speech in Elkhart was not a standalone event. He appeared as a featured speaker at a campaign event in Dade City, Florida, for Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel, and then spoke at a fundraiser for the DCCC in Tampa, Florida, before heading to Cleveland, Ohio, for a campaign rally. Later, he was to appear at a fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Cleveland, and he was to appear in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for another D.C.-area event. The White House said that he would have to leave Washington on Wednesday.

Obama's speech was to be delivered in the shadow of the Republican National Convention, but it was his first public appearance since the Republican convention ended in Cleveland. He spent the day before the convention in New York, attending a dinner held for him by the New York City Council on Public Service, and was scheduled to fly on Thursday to Charlotte, North Carolina, for a paid speech at the Democratic National Convention.

 Trump.

Obama's advisers see his presence as a potent weapon in the war against Trump. On Tuesday, the day after Elkhart, the President's approval ratings, according to the RealClearPolitics.com polling average, were fifty-six per cent. The average for the last two weeks is fifty-eight per cent. In the nineteen-fifties, the average was fifty-one per cent. In the seventies, it was fifty-nine per cent. In the eighties, it was sixty-four per cent. In the nineties, it was sixty-nine per cent. By contrast, Trump's are at thirty-four per cent. Obama, Obama's advisers believe, is, at this point, the single most effective voice against Trump.

The media was not surprised when Obama focused on the economy. "I think his message has been clear from the beginning: the economy is in good shape, and the key to prosperity is not getting bogged down in these constantly inflamed and contentious political conflicts," Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, told me. "That's what he's focused on." But the President's approach is part of a broader shift in the way he sees the world. "I think Obama is really trying to refocus on what he's accomplished over the last eight years," his former speechwriter Favreau said. "He's focused on his successes, and he's focused on the good work he's done with a Democratic Congress. He's focusing on the fact that there are millions of Americans who are struggling, who have seen their 401-k's go down, and who are worried about the future of their kids."

Other Democrats point out that Obama's approach differs from the way Clinton has run her campaign. Clinton has focused on the economy, and on Trump's temperament. She has not been as aggressive in attacking Trump's character. Obama, on the other hand, has been particularly inflammatory, even by his standards. On Monday, he had the crowd at Elkhart singing "Na, na, na, hey hey, goodbye," a popular song from the "Cinderella Man" movie series, in reference to the Republican nominee, and, in a similar vein, "If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."

Obama's approach is part of a broader shift in the way he sees the world.

"If you're going to run a campaign, you can't let the opposition define your opponent," Obama said in Elkhart. "You have to define your opponent." It was a dig at Trump, who, as a candidate, has repeatedly criticized Obama's leadership. "You can't have a campaign where every day you say, 'Boy, I wish President Obama was doing this instead of that,' " Obama said. "You can't have a campaign where the first thing you do is point to the sky and say, 'That's the day Barack Obama failed.' "

Obama did not mention Clinton by name, but he was clearly referring to her, and to his own failings, in Elkhart, where he tied Trump to the mundane problems that have plagued his presidency. "We have not reduced our deficit, not even close," he said. "We've seen the long-term decline in our manufacturing base, and we are seeing that reflected in our trade deficit, which is the largest it's been since the end of World War II." Obama spoke of the impact of his "recovery," which he said "was not only complacent, but self-defeating." In order to make up for the numbers on the deficit, Obama said, "We need to have a real recovery. We need to be investing in education

 anti-establishment candidates like Trump or Bernie Sanders. "I'd encourage him to make a good case for himself," Phil Singer, the longtime Democratic consultant who worked for Bill Clinton, told me. "I think he thinks that he can't lose the way he lost."

As the mood on the campaign trail has darkened, Obama's approval ratings have risen, albeit slowly. Following the September attacks in Paris, the President has been relatively muted. But, as he has done before, he has been able to use the recent terrorist attacks as a means of galvanizing his supporters. In an interview with the New Yorker, he saw the recent terrorist attacks as an opportunity for his supporters to channel their anger toward the Republicans who have opposed Obama's policies. "The only thing that can stop a bad idea is a good idea," Obama said. "And if people are looking for a good idea from somebody who is running for President, they're not going to find it in some of these folks." In her interview with the President, Clinton indicated that, like Obama, she would use the attacks as a launching pad for her own campaign. "I think what we have seen is that there are a lot of people who are sick and tired of the tone" of the campaign, she said. "People are looking for someone. They're looking for a leader who can change the tone in Washington."

But if Clinton and Obama succeed in uniting their supporters in the wake of the terrorist attacks, it will not be because they have one another's backs. It will be because they are both capable of such unity. And, in Obama's case, there may be potential advantages to such a partnership. The President's approval ratings are up because, unlike Clinton, he is a polarizing figure who has been able to prevail upon the country's primary electorate. That, in turn, is rooted in his commitment to domestic and foreign policy. Obama's slogan, "Yes we can," reflects his belief that America, through its greatness, should be able to overcome its many problems and setbacks. In that sense, Obama is more like a Jonas Brothers song than a Bob Dylan song. The Jonas Brothers sing about an idyllic life, but their songs are also about loss.

After all, the original song was written in the aftermath of World War II, when the United States was still at war with the Soviet Union. And if Obama is the Jonas Brothers, then Clinton is, more or less, the boy who cried wolf.

Clinton has been a hawk on national-security issues since the days of her husband's Administration, which served as a launching pad for her own political career. She has consistently supported the Iraq War and, from the start, supported the Bush Administration's Middle East policies. In 2002, when the State Department released a report concluding that Iraq's W.M.D. program was a total failure, Clinton was the only Democratic Senator to vote against an amendment to the Defense Appropriations Act that would have required the administration to provide evidence to Congress that Iraq had since reconstituted its chemical-weapons program. (Clinton said that she would not vote for the amendment because it did not provide enough time for her inspectors to complete their work.) She was also a sponsor of the bipartisan, comprehensive USA Patriot Act, which was signed into law in October, 2001.

In 2005, she co-sponsored the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act, which gave the executive branch sweeping new powers to detain Americans suspected of terrorism. The law permitted the military to shut down any American's Internet service and seize any electronic device that was used to communicate with an American suspected of terrorism. "This bill will establish a new framework for the President and the Department of Defense to conduct a full range of counterterrorism operations, including

The Group uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of share options granted. The model considers many factors that are directly related to the fair value of the shares held by the option holders such as the fair value of options as of the date of grant, the expected volatility of the underlying stock over the life of the options, and the expected dividend yield.

The fair value of the options granted is calculated based on the market price of the underlying stock multiplied by the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the underlying stock, and the expected dividend yield. The fair value of the options granted is recognized as an expense in the statement of income, with the corresponding credit recognized in equity.

Stock purchase plans —To the extent the Company has a share purchase plan, it adjusts the fair value of options granted to reflect the actual exercise price of the related share purchase options.

Dividend receipts —The Group issues dividend receipts for its shareholders, including the Bank for its regular quarterly dividend payments upon the receipt of its profits. All dividends are paid out of earnings.

Details of the outstanding dividends are set out in the Bank's Quarterly Report on Form 20-F for the year ended 30 June 2016, which can be obtained from the Bank's website.

The Group has a recognised minimum capital requirement of $1.0 billion and a maximum capital requirement of $6.0 billion.

Capital and Working Capital —The Group has audited the effectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting as of 30 June 2016. The Group's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
======================================== SAMPLE 468 ========================================
 acquisition price is recorded as a gain in the income statement.

Share-based payment transactions —The Bank has approved Group-wide share options plans for the executive members of the Board of Directors ("BoD"), management and staff of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognized as a compensation cost, with the corresponding credit recognized in equity. The total amount to be expensed over the requisite period, which is determined by reference to the fair value of the share options granted, is calculated with the graded vesting attribution method. The fair value of the options is determined using an option-pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, the expected life of the options, the expected volatility of and the expected dividends on the underlying stock, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option.

When the options are exercised and new shares are issued, the proceeds received net of any transaction costs are credited to common stock and additional paid-in capital.

Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (Accumulated OCI) —The Group records unrealized gains and losses on AFS Securities, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses
==================== COMPLETION 468 ====================
, and deferred tax assets or liabilities, net of tax, in Accumulated OCI on a non-taxable basis. These gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. These non-taxable items are comprehensive income (loss) arising from the changes in fair values of AFS Securities or deferred tax assets or liabilities. The amount of gains and losses carried forward and recognized is subject to change in future periods.

Taxed gains/losses on share-based payments —The Group recognizes an amount of tax benefit from share-based payments that are recognized as a component of AFS Securities when the actual amount of the share-based payment is determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying share option.

During the year ended 30 September 2014, the Group recognized a tax benefit of RMB39 million (US$6.3 million) in connection with share-based payments made to certain employees.

At 30 September 2014, the Group had a liability for share-based payments of RMB1,000 million (US$166 million) related to AFS Securities.

Retirement fund assets —The Group has a defined benefit pension plan for the employees and former employees of the Group (the "Retirement Plan"). These plan assets were established to provide a retirement benefit to the employees and former employees for their working lives, and are used to meet the defined contribution requirements of the Plan.

The Group has become subject to the taxation of the net income of the Retirement Plan and the excess of the Plan's net income over its defined contribution requirements. The Group's contribution of contributions to the Fund is 100% of the Plan's net income.

The Fund has not paid any dividends at any time since its establishment in 2008. The Fund's current assets are invested in a combination of marketable securities and bank deposits. The Fund's investments are principally government and agency securities. The Fund has also invested in mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and foreign currency denominated instruments.

The Fund is a separate legal entity from the Group and is included in the Group's consolidated financial statements. The Group's liability for share-based payments (on which the deduction for share-based payments is based) and the credit for the Fund are reflected in the Group's consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

At 30 September 2014, the Group had a liability for share-based payments of RMB2,218 million (US$394 million) related to the Fund. The Group has provided RMB1,839 million (US$230 million) as a matching contribution to the Fund since its establishment in 2008, which was paid in connection with the establishment of the Fund.

 about the differences between this wide-angle prime and the Batis 25mm. In my opinion, these two lenses are very different in terms of how they should be used out in the field but I can understand the doubt. As of now, they are two of only three wide angle prime lenses available for the Sony FE mount system (excluding all the possibilities with adapted lenses of course). So I decided to extend my thoughts to a more complete analysis with the hope that it will satisfy the curiosity of other Sony FE users as well.

Before starting there is an important point I want to highlight: I reviewed both lenses but at separate times. You can find the dedicated articles below:

This means that you won't find side-by-side comparisons featuring the same scene. If I was talking about two lenses with the same focal length, this would be more of a problem and I probably would have skipped publishing this article altogether. However, in this case, I feel that it is less of an issue because of that 4mm difference, which is quite relevant when talking about wide angle lenses.

So while this comparison will discuss the optical performance of each product, it will primarily focus on my personal experience with both lenses.

Loxia 2.8
==================== COMPLETION 469 ====================
/1.8

I first started using the Loxia 2.8/1.8 nearly a year ago when I bought my Sony FS7. This lens was a gift from Sony and was the first lens I tried with the FE mount. At the time, I had no idea what to expect from this lens or how it would perform with the Sony mirrorless camera. My first impressions were that the lens had very little distortion, was very sharp out of the corners and had very good bokeh. I was only able to capture 4 shots before the lens failed to focus. I was very disappointed but I also couldn't really fault the lens. It was a lens that I didn't understand as much as I would have liked but nonetheless I enjoyed using it.

At that time, I used a Sony A6000 (with MTF chart in the gallery below) for my daily use. However, in the past 3 months, I had upgraded to the Sony A7rII and had used the Sony FE 28mm f/2.8 for only a few days. Since then, everything has changed for me. I used the Sony A7rII extensively for portrait and landscape photography and I am now using the Sony FE 2.8/1.8 exclusively.

I am very happy with the lens. I have only had it for a little over a year, but I still find new things to take advantage of. It has a great bokeh (especially in the corners) and the image quality is excellent. I don't think it is a lens that I would ever let go of.

I don't want to go into the technical details here but bear with me. For this comparison, I decided to use an equivalent focal length of 24mm (the 24mm equivalent focal length on the Sony FE is 24.5mm). I have used 24mm lenses on several Sony cameras previously and they were always very good. I will not go into detail here but I will share a few of the things that I like about this lens.

The first thing that I like best about this lens is that it is very light at 1.8kg (2.8lb). That is a lot lighter than the Sony FE 24mm f/1.8L and it's even lighter than the Sony FE 24mm f/2.8L. The lens feels very solid in hand. The lens hood is very well made and it comes with a nice rubber ring that fits the lens very well.

Before I go into detail, let me tell you what I think is the most important feature of this lens: the size. I have never seen a lens this small and I am very happy with it. It is so small that it is optimal for taking photos without the need to stand up. The lens is also very small enough that I would even be able to carry it around with me in a bag. The barrel is quite long which means that I have never had any problems with smearing or any other optical problems. The lens hood is also very large so it can even be used when the lens is attached to smaller cameras (like the A6000).

Loxia 2/1.8

When I first took the Loxia 2.8/1.8 out of the package, I was very pleased. I was already familiar with the FE 28mm f/2.8L and I was very impressed with the build quality and the sharpness of this lens. I also knew that this lens would be very similar to the FE 28mm but it didn't take me long to notice that the two lenses are different. The Loxia is noticeably smaller and lighter than the FE 28mm.

Loxia 2.8
==================== COMPLETION 470 ====================
/24

Loxia 2.8/24 (full-frame equivalent)

The information about the lens was very straightforward and the focus ring on both lenses works as described. The focus ring on the Loxia is a bit stiffer than the one on the Batis but it is still quiet and fun to use. The focus ring of the Loxia is a bit shorter than the Batis, which makes the lens feel right in the hand.

The Loxia 2.8/24 is a fine lens with decent optics. The lens has a minimum focusing distance of 3.3 meters, which is a bit short (but not that far) and the maximum magnification of 1:4.0. The lens has excellent image quality. The contrast is good with good color saturation and the bokeh is quite nice. The small size of the lens means that the Loxia is not an easy lens to carry around with you. With a lens hood installed, it weighs an incredible 500 grams, which makes it a bit heavier than the Batis 2.8/24.

The lens has a very wide open aperture, which effectively makes the Loxia a very wide angle lens. When stopped down, the lens becomes more of a normal lens, but still a very good one.

The Loxia 2.8/24 is a very sharp lens and the image quality is very good even at f/2.8.

The lens is not a fast lens and the maximum aperture is a bit slower than that of the Batis 2.8/24. In my opinion, this is a somewhat minor issue. At f/2.8 though, the Loxia 2.8/24 is a very good lens and very sharp.

The lens is not a very expensive lens as I have used it for well over a year. It is available for around $400 at B&H.

The huge advantage of the Loxia 2.8/24 over the Batis 2.8/24 is its 24mm focal length. The Batis 2.8/24 has a maximum focal length of 24mm and it is not a very wide lens. The Loxia 2.8/24 is a very nice lens that is much better in every way than the Batis 2.8/24.

The Loxia 2.8/24 is a very versatile lens. It can be used wide open or stopped down. It can be used for landscape or still life photography. It can be used for portraits. It can be used for architecture or landscapes. It can be used to compose close-ups. It can be used for architecture photography. It can be used for still lifes photography. It is not a perfect lens. It is significantly slower than the Batis 2.8/24 but in my opinion, this is not a big issue.

The Loxia 2.8/24 can be used for sports photography. It can be used to take photos of small animals and birds. It can be used for wildlife photography. It can be used for wildlife photography. It can be used for wildlife photography. I have not yet tried it but I plan to.

The Loxia 2.8/24 is a very well-rounded lens. It is a well-built lens with a nice build quality. The lens has a very nice image quality even wide open and, as I mentioned earlier, it is sharp at f/2.8.

The Loxia 2.8/24 is a very nice lens. I consider it to be a very good general purpose lens. One of the main reasons that I prefer this lens over the Batis

Loxia 2.8
==================== COMPLETION 471 ====================
/28-105mm F4 (corrected lens)

I have not used the Loxia 2.8 before and I didn't want to buy it because of my poor experience with the Batis 25mm. I am a strong believer in customer service and I didn't want to waste time and money on a lens that didn't work for me. The fact that my experience with the Batis 25mm is not great is not the reason I decided to write this article, it is the reason I decided to write this article. I'm not going to say that the Loxia 2.8/28-105mm F4 is a bad lens but that it is not as great as it could be.

The build quality of the Loxia 2.8/28-105mm F4 is quite good (it is one of the few lenses that I have in my kit with at least two other lenses that I can use as a replacement for the Loxia 2.8/28-105mm). It has a very nice coating on the front of the lens and the front elements of the lens are very smooth. The design of the lens is quite standard. The focus ring is very smooth and has a nice weight to it. The focusing is quite good; I could focus this lens quite accurately without any issues.

The autofocus system is a little bit different than that of the Batis 25mm. The focus ring is relatively smooth and has a nice weight to it. The focus ring is a little bit stiff at the minimum focus distance but this doesn't bother me too much because I almost always use this lens at around infinity. The focus ring is so smooth that it doesn't really matter where you focus it. I would say that the focus ring is a little bit softer than the Batis 25mm but it is nothing to complain about.

The aperture ring is very smooth and has a nice weight to it. This lens has an aperture ring that is slightly longer than the Batis 25mm. I would say that this aperture ring is a little bit longer than the Batis 25mm but it is not so much that it is going to affect the operation of the lens. If you have read my review of the Batis 25mm you will know that the Batis 25mm has a shorter aperture ring than the Loxia 2.8/28-105mm F4. This doesn't bother me too much because I almost always use this lens at around f/2.8.

The lens includes a very nice neutral density filter. I really like the neutral density filter that comes with this lens; it comes in two pieces and you can easily remove the one piece without the other. The only problem I have with the neutral density filter is that it is not very flexible; it does not provide much flexibility when you want to use it on a wide angle lens.

The zoom ring of the Loxia 2.8/28-105mm F4 is quite small. It is not very stiff and has a nice weight to it. The zoom ring does not rotate when it is in the helicoid. The zoom ring is a little bit stiff when it is in the helicoid. The zoom ring is quite smooth and has a nice weight to it. The zoom ring does not rotate when it is in the helicoid.

We will start with the Loxia 2.8/24mm on the left, and the Batis 2.8/24mm on the right.

Loxia

Loxia 2.8/24mm F4.0 EX R WR @ F5.6 1/250, ISO 800 (left) and 1/320, ISO 800 (right)

The Loxia 2.8/24mm is a manual focus lens, which means that the focusing ring is located at the front of the lens, and the focus distance (distance between the lens and the sensor) is set by rotating the lens mount around the barrel of the camera.

The first thing to keep in mind is that the Loxia 2.8/24mm is NOT a fast lens. It is not exactly "fast" – I'm not sure how fast it is now but it certainly was not as fast as the Sony FE 24mm F2.8G. However, it is not as slow as the Canon EF 24mm F1.4L IS USM.

The Loxia 2.8/24mm has an aperture of f4 and a maximum aperture of f5.6. The aperture ring is a little too short to use the maximum aperture, so you will have to use the f/2.8 setting for the best results. This is not a problem because you should not be focusing at this aperture anyway. The lens is not like a fast prime lens like an FE 24mm F2.8G, which is a fast FE 24mm F2.8 that is specifically designed for use at f/2.8.

As you can see, the Loxia 2.8/24mm focuses very tightly and quickly. It is not like a shallow DOF prime lens like the Sony FE 24mm F2.8G, which does not have a focus ring at all.

The Loxia 2.8/24mm is not particularly smooth in the corners. The corners are somewhat soft and contrasty, but in general, the corners are not bad.

The center is sharp at all apertures, and the image is nicely corrected for chromatic aberration.

As you can see, the Loxia 2.8/24mm has very good contrast, even at the maximum aperture.

The Loxia 2.8/24mm is not particularly sharp wide open, but by f/4, it has very nice corner performance, especially from f/2.8.

The Loxia 2.8/24mm has a tendency to flare. It is not as bad as with the Sony FE 24mm F2.8G, but it is also not as good. The lens is not designed to be used wide open, and it will flare as soon as you stop down.

The Loxia 2.8/24mm has a rather large maximum magnification of 0.3x, so you will definitely need a better macro lens with this lens.

The Loxia 2.8/24mm has very nice bokeh, making it a great portrait lens. The bokeh is soft and smooth, and it does not need an extender to bring out the bokeh.

Compared to the EF 24mm F1.4L II USM, this lens has a slightly soft corner, but it is not as soft as the Sony FE 24mm F2.8G.

The Loxia 2.8/24mm has a nice focus-to-ap

We hope that fans of racing games of all kinds will give us the chance to deliver upon our dreams and desires and create a true successor to GeneRally.

In the most simple terms: we believe GeneRally deserves a sequel.

When we took over development of GeneRally from its original authors (Hannu & Jukka Rabina) in early 2010, it quickly became clear that there was very limited scope for improvement. Much of the game's decade-old systems posed issues with extension and compatibility with today's hardware and modern operating systems. We knew there was only one road to go down to save a game that has brought untold joy to countless men, women and children over the years...

And so in 2011, with the blessing of Hannu & Jukka, work began on GeneRally 2 - a true spiritual successor to GeneRally: a top-down racing game for a more civilised age.

Thank you for your support!<|endoftext|>Much like the state's current taxation system, the state's tax structure is outdated and ineffective.

Texas' tax structure is outdated and ineffective. Both state and local governments have used the same formula to calculate the tax burden of each resident. This formula has been in place for more than 150 years and has failed to keep pace with our changing society.

If ever a state needed a tax reform, it's Texas. We have the most regressive tax system in the country, with the lowest rates in the country.

Texas' tax system is outdated and ineffective.

Although the state's overall tax structure is flat, Texas is the most regressive state in the country. Forty-five of the 50 states rank higher than Texas in this category. In addition, the top income tax rates in Texas are among the highest in the country.

Texas is the most regressive state in the country.

These are just a few of the reasons that Texas is the most regressive state in the U.S., and the worst place to live for the poor.

Texas' tax structure is outdated and ineffective.

Currently, the state's tax structure isn't designed to ensure that all of its residents pay their fair share of taxes.

The state and local governments are responsible for setting the rate of tax at the center of the state. These rates are based on the average of the tax rates for business and individual taxpayers.

For example, when the state's personal income tax rate is 5.25 percent, the individual rate is 0.25 percent. But, when the state's personal income tax rate is 5.25 percent, the individual tax rate is 0.25 percent.

The state's business tax rate is 4.5 percent, which is based on the rate for business in the state. In this case, the business tax rate is 0.25 percent.

The state's corporate tax rate is 8.25 percent, which is based on the rate of the corporate tax in the state. In this case, the corporate tax rate is 0.25 percent.

The state's gross receipts tax rate is 5 percent, which is based on the rate of the gross receipts tax in the state. In this case, the gross receipts tax rate is 0.25 percent.

This means that if you earn $1,000, you will pay $205 in individual income tax, $50 in state income tax, and $35 in gross receipts tax.

However, if you earn $10,000, you will pay $625 in individual income tax, $75 in state income tax, and $1,250 in gross receipts tax.

In addition, the state has a variety of other tax credits, deductions, exemptions, and credits. These tax credits and deductions are intended to "level the playing field" so that all taxpayers pay their fair share.

The UCLA-led study, published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, is the first to provide evidence that the gut microbiota and weight are linked by shared genes.

"While the gut microbiota is known to affect host metabolism, only recently has it been shown that the gut microbiota can also affect weight," said senior author Shoukhrat Mitalipov, a professor of integrative biology and microbiology and immunology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

Mitalipov and his team, including postdoctoral scholar Jacob Erickson, found that the gut microbiota of obese children was different from that of lean children. Fat cells from the obese children produced less leptin, a hormone that signals fat storage, than did those from lean children. The difference in body fat distribution was also correlated with differences in the gut bacteria of the obese children.

"We found that the gut microbiota of obese children is different from that of lean children," Mitalipov said. "These results are particularly

We hope that fans of racing games of all kinds will give us the chance to deliver upon our dreams and desires and create a true successor to GeneRally.

In the most simple terms: we believe GeneRally deserves a sequel.

When we took over development of GeneRally from its original authors (Hannu & Jukka Rabina) in early 2010, it quickly became clear that there was very limited scope for improvement. Much of the game's decade-old systems posed issues with extension and compatibility with today's hardware and modern operating systems. We knew there was only one road to go down to save a game that has brought untold joy to countless men, women and children over the years...

And so in 2011, with the blessing of Hannu & Jukka, work began on GeneRally 2 - a true spiritual successor to GeneRally: a top-down racing game for a more civilised age.

For us, developing GeneRally 2 isn't a task to be done in isolation. The GR community is the lifeblood of the game, and without their constant efforts to

Warmly, Hannu & Jukka

We're not asking you to give up on the game you love. We know you've got a passion for GeneRally and you're not going to let us down! We're just hoping that you'll join us on this journey.

We've got some great ideas for the game we want to bring back to life, but we need your support to help us realise them.

So please take a look at our Stretch Goals and help us make our dream a reality.

This is the moment a Florida woman got a baby out of a fridge in the middle of the night - and it's the last thing she remembers until she woke up hours later in a hospital.

The traumatised mother got a nightmare of a start to the night, after she woke at 4am to find her unborn baby in a fridge alongside a bag of flour.

Her father Chris Mella said he had left the fridge open and the baby was still inside when he got home from work.

He said: "The first thing I remember is waking up and seeing the baby in the freezer in the middle of the night.

"I called 911 and I was so worried."

He said his wife was hysterical and she had no memory of the night before.

After giving the baby a bath to revive her, Chris went back to his bedroom but the baby was gone.

He said: "I went back and got a flashlight and tried to look around but it was dark and I couldn't find the baby."

Chris said he came out of his bedroom and asked his wife if she was alright and she said yes she was fine.

But he then realised she had no memory of what happened.

He said: "I didn't really know what to do and I knew she was upset, so I just took her to the hospital.

"She was crying and I couldn't understand why she was crying."

Chris said he filed a report and the police arrived around 5am.

He said: "I was surprised I didn't get arrested that night. I felt like a criminal."

Chris said he has been very concerned about his wife since the incident and has even called the police department to check on her.

He added: "I'm just very worried. She's never been in trouble before."

(Image: Caters)

Chris has been told the baby is healthy and will be fine.

He said: "She's OK, she's just a little upset.

"She's got a concussion, she's got cuts and bruises and she's got a nose bleed.

"She's not in any pain and she's got all the tubes in her and she's getting better."

Chris said he plans to take the baby to a doctor to get a check-up and to get the baby's address.

He said: "I don't want her to be alone."<|endoftext|>The official website for the television anime of Yana Toboso 's Haruhi Suzumiya light novel series revealed more of the project's cast on Thursday.

 make it fun, we would be nowhere. Our first priority was to create a sequel that would deliver the same excitement and passion that has made the original game so much fun.

It also had to look and feel as good as the original, and as reliable as the original.

That's why we've spent the last half a year preparing for the launch of a brand new beta version of the game, which will be available first on our own website, then on Steam at the end of May, and finally on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. This Beta will be available in several flavours, depending on the platform you choose to play the game on.

The Beta will allow you to play the game's tracks and modes (such as the original run-and-gun and the new 'Race' mode), as well as experience all the things you've come to love about the original game - including the original soundtrack that debuted with the original release, and the brand new fan favourites 'Rally' and 'Tournament' modes.

We hope you'll join us in the beta, and we hope you'll be as excited about it as we are.

We'll be announcing further details on the new beta as we get them - stay tuned!

Until then, please enjoy our teaser trailer and explore the game's brand new sections on our website!<|endoftext|>THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

 deals also with my apprehensions concerning Hurricane wastage in France, which were realised in the Spring of 1940. It also dealt with an estimate worked out by the Air Ministry Organisation Staff that after 3 months of fighting we might expect the fighter strength to have been reduced to 26 squadrons.

In October, 1939, the Air Ministry further reconsidered their policy, and ordered the formation of 10 additional fighter squadrons, 4 of which were destined for the Coastal Command.

In January, 1940, the Northern flank of our continuous defence organisation was on the Forth, and the South-Western flank was at Tangmere in Sussex, with the exception of an isolated station at Filton for the local defence of Bristol and the mouth of the Severn. On the 2nd and 4th February I wrote two letters pointing out these limitations, and asking for an extension of aerodrome facilities, intelligence cover and communications.

On the 9th February I was told that a paper was in preparation, and that I would be given an opportunity to remark on the proposals at a later stage.

On the 6th March I received the paper referred to and forwarded my comments on the 23rd March.

On the 14th May I received a letter from the Chief of Air Staff, which said that the following had been agreed upon: The request for an extension of aerodrome facilities would be withdrawn;

The request for additional intelligence cover would be withdrawn;

The request for aerodrome facilities would be withdrawn, unless the Government should undertake to provide a new aerodrome in France.

I replied on the 17th May, and asked whether the further extension of aerodrome facilities and intelligence cover was still to be given, and if so, what were the implications.

On the 19th May I received a reply from the Foreign Office, which said that the Government had decided to withdraw the request for aerodrome facilities and for additional intelligence cover, and that no further extension of aerodrome facilities or additional intelligence cover would be given.

On the 30th May I received a letter from the Chief of Air Staff to the effect that the Government would be willing to consider the proposal that the request for additional aerodrome facilities and intelligence cover should be withdrawn.

On the 3rd June I wrote to the Air Ministry to ask why I had been told that it was not likely that we would be in a position to supply additional aerodrome facilities or additional intelligence cover, and whether the further extension of aerodrome facilities and intelligence cover would be withdrawn.

On the 4th June I received a reply from the Chief of Air Staff to the effect that the proposal for the withdrawal of aerodrome facilities and intelligence cover which I had been told about had been withdrawn, and that we were now prepared to supply additional aerodrome facilities and additional intelligence cover.

On the 6th June I was informed that the Chief of Air Staff had arranged to meet me at 2.30 p.m. on the 17th June and to advise whether we should be prepared to supply additional aerodrome facilities and additional intelligence cover.

On the 9th June I was informed by the Chief of Air Staff that, in view of the present state of the war, he had decided to supply additional aerodrome facilities and additional intelligence cover, and that the meeting would take place at 2.30 p.m. on the 17th June at the Admiralty.

On the 16th June I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister, asking whether, in view of the present state of the war, the Government would be prepared to supply additional aerodrome facilities and additional intelligence cover.

On the 18th June I received a reply from the Prime Minister in which, after stating that the Government had decided to supply additional aerodrome facilities and additional intelligence cover, he said:

"It is clear that the situation in the Western Front is such that we must supply additional aerodrome facilities and additional intelligence cover to meet the probable requirements of the French Air Force, and that the best possible arrangement will be that the extent of these services will be established as soon as possible, being agreed between the British and French Governments.

"The legal and political arrangements will be the subject of a further communication, which will be transmitted to you as soon as possible."

On the 29th June I wrote a letter to the Chief of Air Staff assuring him of the Prime Minister's approval of the further extension of aerodrome facilities and additional intelligence cover.

He says the ATM card is the basis of a new generation of ATMs for the digital age. I am going to take the test on his website and send him the serial number if he goes through with taking the test.

This is a truly great program. I was researching the ATM card hack and at one point I was only able to find about 2 or 3 articles on the back of the card. The website for this program is a bit more robust and documented than the others I found. The software is fairly easy to learn and even has a bunch of tutorials that are very detailed. After I read through the tutorials I was able to get the card to work without any issues. My first experience was using it to get an ATM to dispense cash from a small amount of money. I had a small amount of money (the amount is kept hidden from you) and the ATM would take this amount of money and dispense the cash out. The ATM card is programmed to only dispense cash when the amount is in the range of $20-$50. The ATM will not dispense cash if the amount is $50 or above. I covered the withdrawal process in a few easy steps and the ATM card was ready to go. After the ATM was programmed I was able to get the cash out without any issues. I gave the ATM card to my friend (a fellow computer science graduate) and he

I don't know if it is a scam or not but i was contacted by a person named " klan" who said that his name is coming out of the sky and that he will give me a 1000$ and a big house after i do some good deeds for him. I thought it was a prank or some kind of scam but i have to admit that i believed him and so i gave him 1000$ and a house..I did as i was told and for about another 6 months or so i was getting all the bills paid and there was never a problem. I was getting all the utilities and all the bills paid and i thought that was it but a few months ago i got a letter from the town hall of my town informing me that i have to pay a fine because i did not pay the fine that klan owed me.. I called the town hall and they told me that if i want to get my money back now i will have to pay a fine and i will have to pay it within 48hrs..I called klan and he told me that he is in debt because he had to go to the court and pay the fine and he is going to get his money back after that..I did as i was told and now i am still in debt because i am still paying the fine.. I have talked to a few other people who have been contacted by this guy and they are still in debt.. This is a scam and it is scary.. I am not sure how this person got my number but I hope he doesn't call me.. September 25, 2015 at 10:27 AM

I just want to let all of you know that I recently had a similar situation to the one you all are talking about happening to me. After giving a friend this $500 card, he then sold it to a friend. The friend then went to sell the card on Craigslist and got caught. The friend then turned himself in and was arrested. The police said they would not be able to find this card since their computer got hacked. They then got a warrant for my friend's computer. No one on my friend's side of the family has this card anymore. I cannot believe this. This is not a joke, this is a real scam going on right now. So if you are reading this, if you think you might have been approached by someone like this, please CALL THE AUTHORITIES: 1-800-477-TIPS (8477) October 1, 2015 at 10:18 AM

I was taught how to reverse engineer the card and see what is on it. It is clear the card has a chip in it. There are too many people to name that have had this card. Note, there is no way you would be able to get your money back. It is illegal to sell a blank ATM card. This card would have to be purchased from an authorized dealer or a short term rental

Sickos don't understand the concept of "privacy" or "privacy" is one of the first things any white person learns in school, so a lot of them don't understand the concept of "privacy" in the context of black people. They think that everyone is sharing their businesses, personal information, social media posts, etc. and that's all they're doing. That's not true. There's a whole lot more to it than that. Being a black person doesn't give you a license to share your business, personal information, social media posts, etc. with whomever you want, whenever you want. That's the whole point of the 2nd Amendment. They're always trying to get it taken away from them, but the 2nd Amendment is there for a reason, and it really pisses me off when even some of my white friends and family members think it's okay to break the law in order to use a firearm. You can't be a part of the "civil rights movement" and sit back and say "well, I'll just do what a black person is doing and break the law in order to be able to defend myself". I'm glad that I have my gun, it's a huge deterrent to a lot of the violent criminal crap out there, and I'm glad that I helped to spread the word about it. I'm sure that I'm not the only black person who has a gun. It's time for us to start acting like it. September 25, 2015 at 11:04 AM

A lot of people think that blacks are so entitled and always will be that they never learn. They really have no idea what "privacy" truly is. Blacks aren't just going to sit and watch their business get stolen. If they knew what "privacy" was, they would know how to protect themselves. When you have a firearm, you have a responsibility to protect it at all times. Even if that means that you have to take your life in your hands. September 25, 2015 at 11:05 AM

I have been watching BRA the past two years. The same organization that is the main reason the mainstream media is not covering this story because of the media's agenda to promote race war. The same organization that is responsible for this "massacre" that has the media and police completely turning a blind eye. I have a question for all of you. Why would someone want to harm a police officer? Why would anyone want to hurt a security guard? Why would anyone want to kill a doctor? Why would anyone want to commit suicide? Many of us who are in the "criminal" underground know that the black community is a dysfunctional culture and that blacks are not going to do normal, civilized things. But, the problem is that many of us who are not part of the criminal underground are forced into the criminal underground by the criminal environment and that's the only way that we make a living. Many of us who are in the criminal underground know that there is no way out for blacks. The only way that we can possibly be free is if we are willing to take our lives in our hands, because it is a very simple equation. If blacks were truly civilized, then they would not be in the criminal underground. If blacks were truly civilized, then they would stop hurting innocent people and just live their lives. I have a feeling that if it wasn't for the fact that the black community is dysfunctional and has no real relationship with the law, that this tragic event would not have happened.

Orlik Golden Sliced is a refreshing sort of tobacco that should be welcomed by almost any pipe smoker, and it has become one of my favorite brands for daily use.

The flavor doesn't last long, but it isn't bitter or harsh and it burns very cool. In this respect, it has a lot in common with venerable blends like Samuel Gawith's Luxury Bullseye Flake. The only thing I don't like about this blend is the room note. It's a little harsh for me, but it's not overwhelmingly so. I don't smoke this in a pipe that is large enough to accommodate the 50g tin and I've never used a pipe cleaner. This is a tobacco for those who like a little bit of something different, but don't want anything too strong. Nobody has rated this review yet.

The tobacco is a beautiful golden brown color, easily sliced and rubbed out. It is very easy to pack and light and stays lit superbly. The flavors are very rich and mellow.

Anecdotal evidence from brokers is often the best guide to real estate prices in China, where government indexes of transactions are flawed.

The national government's own index of real estate prices attracts skepticism from analysts. Beijing statisticians allow local governments to measure prices based on a few old neighborhoods in each city where few transactions take place, so the national index shows fairly stable prices year after year in a wildly gyrating market.

Private surveys of real estate developers tend to reflect price increases accurately during good times, but few developers have been willing to admit their heavy discounting in the past year.

Other economic statistics released on Sunday also did not paint a cheerful picture. Retail sales were up 13.2 percent in August from a year ago, maintaining the slower pace they have shown through the summer — although part of the slowness reflects lower inflation.

The central bank's daily economic indicators have remained stable for the past month, and the central bank said in a statement on Sunday that economic activity was likely to continue at a moderate pace.

The central bank's statement did not give any clues about the direction of policy. Analysts said it was unlikely that the central bank would unveil a new set of interest rate cuts in the coming months, but that the central bank would probably be cautious about raising interest rates in the short term, given the uncertainty about the growth outlook.

China's central bank has kept interest rates artificially low for years, a policy that has helped China stay out of a global recession despite its economic slowdown. Much of the recent economic growth has been fueled by cheap money from the central bank, which has kept its benchmark interest rate near zero for years.

The central bank has kept interest rates low in the hope that it will sustain a cultural preference for saving over spending and that the country's slowing economic growth will in time lead to a surplus of savings, which will in turn stimulate demand. The central bank has also kept interest rates low to help banks lend more, which reflects the belief that the economy is still recovering from the global financial crisis.

In a sign that the central bank is still concerned about the slowing economy, the bank said on Sunday that its interest rate targets would remain unchanged.

But the central bank's statement appeared to be more focused on the fact that real estate prices continued to rise, suggesting that its policy of keeping interest rates low would not be enough to prevent sharp price increases.

"The authorities' policy has not been effective in slowing housing prices in the short run," said Li Hui, an economist at Shenzhen Zhonghua Securities.

A survey conducted by China Real Estate Information Corp. last month showed that most property developers were willing to cut prices by 10 percent to 15 percent to sell apartments. But most developers did not see such cuts as practical because they needed to raise much larger amounts of capital to finance the projects.

"From the perspective of a developer, the price cut is a good thing, but the question is what will happen in the long run," said Rui Zhang, a Shanghai-based economist. "Most developers are still reluctant to cut prices."<|endoftext|>The US Air Force has ordered a second F-35A Lightning II from Lockheed Martin, signalling the arrival of its fourth generation fighters in the skies over the Atlantic.

The government report was expected to add to growing signs that Beijing is dealing with the impact of slowing growth and capital outflows, which have caused a sharp depreciation of the renminbi.

The Chinese central bank has been buying dollars to support the renminbi, which has fallen about 20 percent against the dollar since mid-June. But the central bank's efforts have had little impact on the dollar's value against the yuan.

China is on course for its slowest expansion in 25 years, the International Monetary Fund said in a report on Saturday. The report, based on figures from the Ministry of Commerce, showed that growth was 2.4 percent in the second quarter, down from 2.8 percent in the first quarter.

The Chinese government has adopted strict limits on credit growth in recent months, and the central bank has stepped up its efforts to rein in a speculative property market in the south.

"If there's any sign of easing, that will be welcomed by most Chinese," said Victor Shih, a Shanghai-based economist at Commerzbank. "But if they do not ease, or do it in a half-hearted way, it will have a negative effect."

"The consumption side is still under pressure," said Wang Feng, head of economic research at West Capital Investment.

The housing market could rebound in the coming months. There are two major factors that could help: the slowdown in industrial production and a return of housing construction in cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen that were previously hit by a shortage of land.

Some of those cities have made progress in rebuilding housing in the last year, but some experts warn that the problems are far from solved.

"The conditions are still very bad," said Zhang Qing, an economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. "We are still not able to build enough housing."

Many analysts believe that China's economy will not escape the downturn unless the government pushes to loosen its grip on the economy, a move that would inevitably bring higher inflation.

China is already expected to post more than 10 percent inflation in the year ending in June, and economist Peter Zhou of Citigroup said that such a rise in prices would lead some to doubt whether China could withstand a downturn in the economy.

"The question is whether it can sustainably sustain that kind of inflation," he said. "At the moment, we are still not convinced that it can."

However, Mr. Zhou said that the government's recent efforts to tighten the rules on lending to the real estate sector could ease the pressure on prices.

"The biggest risk is that the central bank could help the real estate market by lowering the mortgage interest rate," he said. "If that happens, it will help," he added.<|endoftext|>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Friday that Iran should not be allowed to accelerate its nuclear program at the expense of an international agreement to restrict Tehran's nuclear activities, while Russia expressed hope that an agreement would be reached.

I've made the point before that I have no problem with the idea of diversity, as long as it's not a race-based whole. I also don't think that it's a good idea to pick and choose which ethnicities or racial groups you want to be inclusive of, and I don't think that it's a good idea to just allow anyone in regardless of whether or not they're a designated minority. But I do think that we should recognize that there are different types of diversity, and should not be so quick to use the word "diversity" to mean "all races." I think that this is particularly important now, when we're facing a real crisis of racism in this country.

It's not that I think that we should all be trying to be like everybody else. I'm not all that impressed with the current crop of "woke" celebrities, for example. It's not that I don't like the idea of diversity or ethnic-specific groups. I'm just not very excited about it. It's not that I think that they should all be lumped together and regarded as the same thing. It's that I think that all of the different strains of diversity that we want to discuss should be identified and recognized as such.

Diversity is not the same thing as "all-black." Not everyone who is black is a member of the Black Panther party. Not everyone who is Chinese is a member of the Kuomintang. Not everyone who is Hispanic is a member of the PRI. Diversity is quite a lot of different things. It includes such things as gender, sexuality, religion, class, ability, age, disability, and so on. The point is that we should stop saying "diversity" and start saying "diversity of cultures."

Diversity is not a monolithic thing. That's just a stupid way of looking at things.

(This post is a modified excerpt from a longer piece that originally appeared on TheCultureCycle.com.)<|endoftext|>The "mushroom cloud" of the far-right is up in arms over Donald Trump's military action against Syria.

But what of the many thousands of Syrian refugees who have fled to Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and elsewhere over the past five years, fleeing violence from President Bashar al-Assad's regime and ISIS? Are they "collateral damage" of the Trump administration's war with Assad?

By now, it should be clear that the answer is no.

The United States has rescued more than 3 million Syrians since 2011. In the past few years, it has played a key role in coordinating a push for a ceasefire in Yemen, helping to stabilize Iraq and training Iraqi security forces. The latest humanitarian crisis in Syria is the result of the Assad regime's brutal and indiscriminate assault on the country's civilian population.

The U.S. has been at the forefront of the effort to reach a cease-fire in Syria, but it's not the U.S. that is suffering from the violence. The Assad regime's indiscriminate attacks on civilians have forced millions of Syrians from their homes. The U.N. estimates that more than 3 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011.

More than half the refugees in the region are children, and despite their ages, they are the most vulnerable to the conflict and its consequences. The United Nations has found that many of the children fleeing to Jordan are suffering from malnutrition and dehydration
