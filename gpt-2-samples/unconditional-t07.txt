Makers say the new system is much more difficult to hack

Raspberry Pi is a tiny computer which comes with an ARM processor, so it's easy to hack. But now the makers of this tiny computer have come up with an even more powerful chip: the Raspberry Pi 2.

The Raspberry Pi 2 runs an ARM-based processor, which means it's much more difficult to hack. The Raspberry Pi 2 has a much bigger internal memory, so it is also easier to store big programs in memory. It also has a faster processor than its predecessor, and it has a built-in WiFi and Bluetooth.

The Raspberry Pi 2 has been in the works for about a year, with a number of different designs. The current version is the one shown above, which is a Raspberry Pi Model B. The Raspberry Pi Model A is a Raspberry Pi without an SD card slot, so it doesn't have any built-in internet connectivity.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation has been working on the Raspberry Pi 2 for some time now, and it's a big improvement over the old Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi 2 is smaller, has more memory, and has better internet connectivity.

The Raspberry Pi 2 is available for under $30 from a number of places, including Amazon, and will be available in the UK, US, Australia and Europe soon.<|endoftext|>Description

The following information is from the Official World of Warcraft website.

The Burning Legion is a faction of demonic invaders that preys on the unsuspecting worlds of Azeroth. They are led by the deposed lord of the Burning Legion, Kil'jaeden, and are known to be led by a Kaldorei Highlord. They are also known as the Legion in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.

Interestingly, when the world was born of the Well of Eternity and gave birth to the World Tree, the true name of the world was not revealed. A book named "The Ebon Herald" by the Prophet Velen alluded to this, and in the book he revealed the name of the world was "Azeroth".

The Burning Legion was created when the Well of Eternity was destroyed at the dawn of time, and the titans, the leaders of the species of the world, were buried under the ruins. The titans, after giving birth to the world to dwell on, vanished forever and the world was left in the care of the titans. The titans were then buried under the ruins by the Burning Legion. The Legion's servants, the demons, were created from the bones of the fallen titans and the blood of the first born.

The Burning Legion were created by Kil'jaeden, who had been trapped in the Well of Eternity by the titans. Kil'jaeden was then sent forth by the titans to conquer Azeroth.

The Burning Legion's main goal is to extinguish life on Azeroth. They are at war with the mortal races, but are also at war with each other. Each demon has a distinct set of goals. The Burning Legion are known to attack outposts of the Alliance and the Horde in order to gain material to fuel their warmachine, and do so on a regular basis.

Overview Edit

The Burning Legion are a faction of demonic invaders that preys on the unsuspecting worlds of Azeroth. They are led by the deposed Lord of the Burning Legion, Kil'jaeden, and are known to be led by a Kaldorei Highlord. They are also known as the Legion in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.

The Legion are known to be a race of demonic beings, with a number of elemental sub-races. They are also known to be at war with each other. The Burning Legion are known to attack outposts of the Alliance and the Horde in order to gain material to fuel their warmachine, and do so on a regular basis.

The Burning Legion are the source of the Curse of Flesh, which spreads to all living things in Azeroth. The Burning Legion are also known to have created the Ley-Line Defenses, a gigantic network of energy-infused portals that prevent the passage of the living and the undead.

The Burning Legion are also known to have created the thum'um, a ritualistic language with known uses on the demon world of Niskara and on Azeroth itself.

The Burning Legion are known to have created the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, a vast, magical forest that is home to the Kaldorei, the Highborne of the Silver Hand and a great number of other races.

The Burning Legion are known to have created a number of weapon types.

The following section contains information from the Warcraft RPG which is considered non-canon.

Biology Edit

Gargantuan demons, the Burning Legion are a race of demons whose physiology and diseases are the result of the Curse of Flesh. The physical appearance of these demons is a combination of demons and humanoid creatures; while their skin is of the same color as their surroundings, the most prominent feature of their bodies is a massive black eye set in an otherwise smooth face.

Each demon is born with a pair of horns and a wide mouth. Among the demons, their skin is often of a dark, mottled color, while their eyes are usually black. The Burning Legion's hunger is also extremely different from those of other demons. Instead of consuming blood from individuals, the Burning Legion's hunger is the only hunger of the world, and causes it to burn with a constant, ravenous intensity.

The Burning Legion tend to be very large and have a large and complex anatomy. Their bodies are composed mostly of iron and ash, and their skin is quite flexible and malleable. Their horns and teeth are barbed and jagged.

The Burning Legion have a number of unusual and bizarre abilities. An innocent observer might easily mistake a Burning Legion demon for a normal demon, but the Burning Legion's location also provides them with a great deal of camouflage.

The Burning Legion have the ability to fly, and can use this ability to move across land and air. They have a particularly powerful form of levitation, allowing them to fly for long distances. The Burning Legion

Mobs of young men, in blue T-shirts and black balaclavas, waved Ukrainian flags and sang "Glory to Ukraine!" as they gathered in the city center of the eastern city of Donetsk on Saturday, calling for the government in Kiev to leave.

They chanted, "No to the bandits!" and "We are ready to die for Ukraine!"

Protesters described the Kiev government as the "bandits" and "fascists" and said they would not leave the streets until the pro-Western authorities in Kiev quit.

The protesters, who seem to be mainly young men and boys, called for the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, a close ally of Russia whose presidency was ended by the ouster of the Moscow-backed president in February.<|endoftext|>Written by: Carolee

So I have been trying to find a good way to do my nails. While I can't seem to find a good way to do my nails, I can find a good way to do my eyes for the eyelids.

I am trying to get my eyelids painted first, then my nails.

I am trying to get my eyelids painted first, then my nails. I have tried several different brands and blue, pink, purple, and red ones. In the end, I settled on the brand called "Tarte". I can't remember exactly how I got it. I ordered it on the day of my holiday and it was delivered 4 days later. I have been using it for a week now and I love it.

It also came with a brush and a set of three applicators. I will definitely purchase them again.

I have also tried the "Makeup Geek" eyeshadows. They are really good at increasing the depth of the colors on my eyes and they are more affordable than the other brands. I am also a fan of the Must Have Shades.

I also tried out the "Makeup Revolution" eyeshadows and they are a bit more expensive than the other two.

I have yet to try out the "Powder" eyeshadows.

So far I am very satisfied. I do think that the powder eyeshadows are a bit too sheer for my taste. But as long as the brand I buy is the same one I used before, I am okay with that.

I have a couple of other orders coming in soon so we will see how they perform.

I am also getting the "Color Stick" eyeshadows now. I haven't tried them yet. I think I will give them a shot.

So my next step is to get my nails painted. I am really excited about it. I think I will post some pictures of how my nails looked on my fingers as well!

Advertisements<|endoftext|>In the latest issue of "The Revolutionary Communist" we presented a paper by the CWI-USA that deals with "Why the Communist Party in the U.S. Should Never Be Called 'Communist'" (see Vol. 1, No. 1 on this website). It seems to be something of a classic that has been cited a lot of times. It is the paper that is made available on the website and has been in print for a number of years.

A few comments on the paper. First, it is a bit dated. It was written in the 1980s, when the US was in the midst of the cold war. In that context, the term "socialist" was applied to a wide range of groups and individuals, including Maoists, Trotskyists and liberals. In fact, this paper is really an attempt to refute the claim that the term "communist" had become tainted, but it still makes for a good old-fashioned Marxist critique of the unprincipled use of a term to cover an array of ideological positions, and an outstanding piece of work in its own right.

Secondly, the paper presents an analysis of the "Communist Party" in the U.S., not as a "political organization" but as a "political organization in capitalist society." That is, it's a party that is acting in the interests of capital and is not a revolutionary group dedicated to overthrowing capital. We have some hope that the document will be useful for those who want to see the "Communist Party" in the U.S. become a revolutionary organization, but it is worth noting that the "Communist Party" in the U.S. is largely an electoral, electoral-oriented organization.

The third point to make is that the term "communist" is often used in a way that is almost completely divorced from the content of the ideology that it is used to describe. We don't see the term "communist" used exclusively for the ideas of Maoism or Trotskyism. We see it used for the ideas of the leadership of the "Chinese Communist Party" (CCP), for example. In fact, we see

What Is The Importance Of The QWERTY Layout?

The QWERTY keyboard layout has been used for over 90 years. It was originally created by the IBM Corporation, in the 1940s. It was originally designed for the typewriter, but it eventually found its way into all kinds of technology like computers, telephones and even calculators. The keyboard layout has been used in popular culture since the days of Star Trek. It's also been used on TV and movies.

But how do you use a keyboard if you only learn it once?

This is where I come in.

The most important part of the QWERTY keyboard layout is the placement of the "home" key. There are many articles out there explaining how to change the keyboard layout, but they're all a little confusing. I've found that using the "home" key in combination with the "delete" key is the most efficient way to learn the keyboard layout.

Learn The Layout

The first thing you should do is learn the layout. You can do this for free online.

I highly recommend learning the QWERTY layout. This is the one that is used on most typewriters and other typewritten devices. The QWERTY layout is also used on computers, how are you to know which one you have?

The enemy of my enemy is my friend, so it is difficult for me to condemn any person when his actions are in the service of the people. But I can't ignore the fact that the far left, in particular, has waged a war on free speech. Their hatred for free speech is the reason that they demand that we accept the use of violence to silence anyone who dares disagree with them.

One of the most egregious examples of this double standard is the #MeToo movement. This movement has already been labeled a "witch hunt" by the media and social justice warriors, but it's important to understand what exactly this movement is.

What is the #MeToo movement?

The #MeToo movement was started by Tarana Burke, who saw the issue of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace as a major problem. Rather than stopping this problem, she wanted the truth to come out and to call out those who perpetuated this problem.

The movement was born from a desire to expose the perpetrators of sexual harassment, assault, and rape in order to stop it from happening again. It is also a protest against the silence of women who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or rape.

Who is behind the #MeToo movement?

The #MeToo movement is a well-funded, far-left movement that is funded by George Soros, the Ford Foundation, and others. The neo-Marxist movement has been working to silence people who speak out against feminism, multiculturalism, homosexual rights, and other radical causes.

This movement has been outrageous in its determination to shut down anyone who disagrees with them. They have sought to silence anyone who disagrees with them, even if that person is a well-respected journalist.

However, it is important to understand that the far left is not the only group that has been working to silence free speech. The far right has also been working to silence free speech, and it is these two groups that are the true enemies of free speech.

The #MeToo movement is not the only example of the far left shutting down free speech. In fact, a number of far-right groups have been working to silence free speech, including the #BlackLivesMatter movement, the alt-right, and the alt-right trolls.

Many of these far-right groups have been extremely successful in silencing free speech. For example, the alt-right has successfully shut down campuses across the United States, including University of California campuses, the University of Chicago, and the University of Michigan.

The alt-right trolls have successfully shut down free speech on Twitter by calling for the death of prominent anti-fascist activists. These trolls have been able to silence conservative voices in the media, including Breitbart News, The Daily Caller, and The Daily Wire.

These far-right groups have also shut down free speech by shutting down Milo Yiannopoulos' access to the Internet. The alt-right trolls have also been able to shut down free speech on Facebook by removing the accounts of people who criticized the alt-right on the social network.

These are the real enemies of free speech. There is no question that the #MeToo movement is a far-left movement, but the #MeToo movement is not the only example of free speech being silenced.

What are the perpetrators of the #MeToo movement?

The #MeToo movement has been used as an excuse to shut down free speech.

The movement has been used by the far-left to silence conservative voices and to silence conservatives who disagree with the far-left. The #MeToo movement has been used by the far-left to silence Trump supporters, conservatives, and other conservatives who are simply critical of the far-left.

But the #MeToo movement has been used by the far left to silence conservative voices because they have been used as the scapegoat for everything that is wrong with society today. The #MeToo movement has been used to silence conservative voices because they are the only ones who can be held responsible for the problems in society today.

As a result, the #MeToo movement has been used as an excuse to silence conservative voices.

For example, the #MeToo movement has been used as an excuse to silence conservative voices by blaming conservatives for everything that is wrong in society. The #MeToo movement has been used to silence conservative voices by blaming conservatives for everything that is wrong in society today.

The #MeToo movement has been used as an excuse to silence conservative voices because the #MeToo movement has been used to silence conservative voices. The #MeToo movement has been used as an excuse to silence conservative voices because the #MeToo movement has been used to silence conservative voices.

The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) released the findings of a five-year investigation into the workplace to The Guardian. The report found "systemic" gender-based discrimination, harassment and sexual assault in the workplace, and that some women are being forced to leave their jobs because of sexual assault.

"It's shocking," said Angelina Jolie, the actress who was named the UN's goodwill ambassador for women's rights in 2015, in a press statement. "The report shows that women face life-altering discrimination at work every single day and that we all have a responsibility to protect and work for them."

Jolie also noted that the report helps highlight the need to reform workplace discrimination laws, to allow both women and men to speak out against what they see as unfair discrimination.

The report came in the wake of the #MeToo campaign that has spread across the world after actresses including Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow shared their own stories of sexual assault. The #MeToo campaign was founded by Tarana Burke, a former assistant director of the United Nations Development Program, and her friend, Kumi Naidoo.

In the report, the committee stated that men and women experience sexual harassment in the workplace at nearly the same rate: 20 percent of women reported sexual harassment in the workplace compared to 16 percent of men. The report also found that women who reported being sexually harassed were less likely to be promoted, and that women with children were more likely to experience harassment and sexual assault.

Women's rights advocates have been calling for a change in the workplace's culture for decades, and have often been met with resistance.

"You don't have to be a feminist to understand the way that the workplace has been sexist," Alisha Hershberger, a political adviser to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, told the New York Times. "Women are seen as weak and sex objects. Sexism infects almost every institution and part of our culture."

Herrmann added that the report "provides a glimmer of hope that we can change the way the world works, and that things can get better for women."

The report did not address the work-life balance of women, however.

The committee's investigation included an in-depth look at discrimination in the workplace, the sexual harassment of women in the workplace, and the impact on the workplace environment for women. The committee also looked into the lack of sexual harassment training at work and the effectiveness of job training programs for women.

CEDAW noted that the world is unlikely to see a gender-equitable workplace until the next generation of women becomes "as strong and independent in their careers as they are today."

The report comes just two weeks after a series of sexual harassment allegations led to the termination of Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly.

The funds were to be used for training, equipment and supplies. The US was using the funds to train and equip the Afghan National Army to fight the Taliban and the Haqqani Network. The US also built and paid for a prison in Afghanistan to detain and interrogate detainees, including US citizens, without the knowledge of the government of Afghanistan. The prison was used as a holding facility for US military detainees.

This was a gross violation of the laws of war and international law. The US had to provide access to the prisoners and the US government had to allow the Afghan government to interrogate and detain the prisoners. This was not done.

By 2009, the US government created what it called the Interrogation Cell Facility in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The prison was built and funded by the US government. The cell was built using American taxpayers' money, and US troops paid for it. The cell was built to hold eight detainees at a time. The prison was used to interrogate detainees without the knowledge of the Afghan government.

This is the US's accounting of what happened.

The US government is now trying to spin this into something else.

It has labeled the cell prison a "detention facility" and says it was used for "detention only."

This is what the US government says about the cell prison:

Prospects look good for Miro Heiskanen to stick with the Blackhawks in 2017-2018

The Chicago Blackhawks are expecting to have Miro Heiskanen back in the lineup by the end of the season.

Heiskanen was a healthy scratch for three games this season and was a healthy scratch for Saturday's game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Heiskanen did not see the ice again until Tuesday's game against the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Heiskanen has been on injured reserve since Nov. 7 and has missed 21 games. He missed the past two games with an abdominal injury and was on the ice for the first period of the Blackhawks' 4-3 overtime loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday.

"He was off for a couple of days and then came back and played quite well," Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said after the game. "He's worked hard. He's a good player. He's a smart player. He can shoot the puck. He can make plays. He's been in the league for five years, so he's going to come back and play well and be a good player for us."<|endoftext|>The Russian government responded with outrage Thursday to a new U.S. sanctions bill targeting Moscow's financial and energy sectors. The bill, which comes as the United States is conducting a major military operation in Syria, would bar U.S. firms from doing business with Russia's defense and intelligence sectors.

The new sanctions are "inexcusable and harmful," Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in a statement.

He called the bill "a continuation of the U.S. policy of sanctions against our country in the pursuit of its geopolitical interests."

The new sanctions were proposed in December by the House of Representatives in response to Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The bill has not yet been passed by the Senate.

The U.S. sanctions bill, which has passed the House of Representatives, would target individuals and companies with ties to the Russian defense and intelligence sectors, including the Russian military, the FSB, and the Russian intelligence service known as the GRU.

The bill has also been criticized by U.S. officials who say that the new sanctions would have a "chilling effect" on the U.S. and Russian economies, and one of the bill's supporters, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., said they were intended to "rein in the excesses of Russia's aggression in Europe."

The bill would also prohibit U.S. citizens from making financial transactions with the Russian defense and intelligence sectors, unless they are doing business with a U.S. company or person.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the bill was "unacceptable" and that Russia would retaliate against the U.S. by imposing its own sanctions.

"The new U.S. sanctions against Russia are unacceptable," Peskov told reporters. "We are counting on the U.S. to comply with the law, and that will get a response from us."

U.S. sanctions have already been levied on Russian companies, including state-owned energy giants Rosneft and Gazprom. The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of Justice have also targeted individuals.

Russia has denied there is any interference in the U.S. election.<|endoftext|>The UESPWiki – Your source for The Elder Scrolls since 1995

A quest (quest title) is a short quest that, upon completion, grants you fame or glory. Some quests may be repeated, and some quests may take place in multiple locations.

Some quests start you on a quest to recover the body of a man. When you return, the quest immediately ends. When you complete the quest, you will receive a reward and the quest will be returned to your quest log.

Quests may also be started by asking someone for help, and then turning in the quest to them. These quests will not end in any particular way, but will generally give you a reward.

Some quests require you to go out of your way to obtain a quest item, and can be completed only while you are in the area, either in an active quest or in an active dungeon.

There are some quests that are specific to certain types of creatures.

Quests can be taken by everyone, although they are unlikely to be accepted by all. Sometimes, a quest will ask you to kill someone, which can be done by killing the person or by killing the creature.

Despite the name, quests are not limited to mages.

There are two main types of quests:

After our last post, we touched base on C++11 features that will likely be supported by the next C++ standard. The first of those is the new "extended integral types", which will likely be part of the C++0x standard.

We are really excited about this one, as it will allow for the standardisation of things like "shift-only" floating-point arithmetic, and it will be usable with existing compilers.

(This post may be a bit long, so here is a summary of the main points.)

The basic idea is that standard integral types, like int , float , and double , are defined as being of integral types. So, for example, any floating-point number can be represented using either the int type, or the float type, or the double type. (Some compilers, like GCC and Visual Studio, already support the double type, but that is not enough, as the double type only supports the IEEE 754 format.)

However, the standard also defines a set of "extended integral types", which extend the range of the standard integral types. For example, the int integral type can represent an integer value of the integer type, or an integer value of the extended integral type.

We can now define "shift-only" floating-point arithmetic, as the extended integral types will introduce a super-signed double type, and it will be possible to represent any floating-point number using either of the standard integral types.

In addition to the standard integral types, the extended integral types will also support the "unary minus operator", which is often used by compilers to represent negative numbers. (This is broadly similar to the "unary minus operator" used by C++03's standard library, but is not supported by GCC and Visual Studio.)

So, for example, if we are working with a double value, it is possible to compute its complement, or to add a double value to a double value.

It is important to note that the extended integral types are actually "unary". They are added to existing types, and so will not expand to any new types, but will remain valid as existing types.

There is one really important difference between the standard integral types and the extended integral types: the extended integral types do not support the signed/unsigned distinction in comparison operations.

With the standard integral types, if we do want to define a signed/unsigned comparison operation, we need to use either (or both) the signed/signed operations, or the unsigned/unsigned operations.

The extended integral types will not require the signed/unsigned distinction. Instead, we can use the standard signed/unsigned operations, and the extended integral types will be providing a "dual" representation.

In fact, the standard signed/unsigned operations already exist, and the extended integral types will provide a way to use them.

The standard signed/unsigned operations are:

Compare and swap (same as the C99 standard's intcmp and intswap , but with the extended integral types):

int f(int a, int b) { return a + b; } int g(float a, float b) { return a - b; } int h(double a, double b) { return a * b; } int i(int a, int b) { return a >= b ? a : b; }

A programmer can also define a "unary minus operator", which will have the same semantics as the C++ standard's intnminus . (This will likely be called "intnminus", but we still need a name.)

int f(int a, int b) { return a - b; } int g(float a, float b) { return a * b; } int h(double a, double b) { return a / b; }

(This is not a complete list of the standard signed/unsigned operations, but we can still use these operations for convenience.)

And the extended integral types will provide a way to use them.

int f(int a, int b) { return a + b; } int g(float a, float b) { return a - b; } int h(double a, double b) { return a * b; }

We can use the standard signed/unsigned operations to construct the extended integral types.

int f(int a, int b) { return a + b; } int g(float a, float b) { return a - b; } int h(double a, double b) { return a * b; }

Because we are using the standard signed/unsigned operations, and the extended integral types will be providing a way to use them, we can also use the standard arithmetic operators for shifting and dividing the extended integral types.

The alleged culprits behind a vicious, prolonged cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment have been identified, according to VP of the security firm ThreatConnect.

The attack began in late 2014, and was meant to disrupt the movie studio's release of The Interview, a film depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.

The U.S. government has since blamed North Korea for the attack, which compromised the servers of Sony Pictures Entertainment in late 2014.

"It's pretty clear now that the attacker [was] North Korea," ThreatConnect's CEO, Avivah Litan, told Wired. "The attack lasted for months, and it was launched by someone in North Korea."

The attack involved malware that was meant to disrupt the movie studio's release of The Interview, a film depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. (Reuters)

Litan said that when they examined the malware used in the attack, they found that it was "almost identical" to that used in previous attacks on banks and government agencies.

Litan added that there was "more evidence" that the attack was indeed carried out by North Korea, and that the attackers may have been looking to gather intelligence on Sony before carrying out the attack.

"There was some activity in the past that suggested that the attackers were looking to gather intelligence with this attack," she said. "If that's the case, it's pretty clear that the attackers were North Korea."

The company said it did not have evidence that the attack itself was carried out by a North Korean government, but that the group behind the attack appears to be connected to the country.

"These attacks are used to gather intelligence, which North Korea is also doing," Litan said.

The company believes that the victim of the attack was Sony Pictures Entertainment, or some of its subsidiaries, but did not disclose which companies it believed were affected.

On Friday, Sony Pictures Entertainment put out a statement confirming that the attack was carried out by a group that it believes "belongs to North Korea." The group "used the same malware that was used in previous attacks against South Korean banks, government agencies and media outlets," the company said.

After the attack began, the studio had to put in place additional security measures. (Mark Lennihan/Associated Press)

Sony Pictures Entertainment is currently working through an internal investigation of the attack, and said that it "has been trying to determine who was responsible for the attack and to ensure that no further information can be released publicly at this time."

"We are taking the measures necessary to protect our systems and our employees," the statement said. "We are continuing to investigate and are working closely with law enforcement to determine the origins of this attack. We have suspended our scheduled release of The Interview in the wake of the attack and are working closely with law enforcement."

Litan did not disclose the specific steps the company is taking to protect its systems.

As well, the company is putting additional security measures in place.

"We are taking the measures necessary to protect our systems and our employees," the statement added.

The Sony hack was one of the largest cyberattacks in history.

It affected systems at Sony Pictures Entertainment, as well as at the Motion Picture Association of America, which represents the studios and other exhibitors in the movie business.

Litan said that she believes the problem was not that Sony Pictures Entertainment failed to pay the hackers, but that the attackers were willing to take the risk.

"There is always a risk involved in doing business with North Korea," she said. "They are a rogue state, and they will do anything to harm their country.

"This is an attack on the American free press and the American economy," she added. "It's an attack on the free world."<|endoftext|>BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Constitutional Court has ruled in favor of an appeal by the anti-Islam PEGIDA movement against a ban on a demonstration by its supporters.

The demonstration by around 3,000 people, who reject the expansion of Islam in Germany, has been banned by the authorities on grounds it could incite violence.

The Constitutional Court said on Friday the ban on the demonstration did not breach the freedom of assembly because its organizers had no intention of engaging in violence.

The PEGIDA movement had appealed against the ban after it was imposed in October.

The movement had argued that the ban was unconstitutional and a violation of free speech.<|endoftext|>Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday that Iraq was "on the brink of a sectarian civil war," following a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.

Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth have given a further £10m to charity in their fight against cancer after the death of Prince Harry.

Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, had pledged £10m to the National Cancer Intelligence Network after the death of their son, Prince William, last year.

The money, announced in the Queen's Speech on Tuesday, will go to the charity's funding of a national cancer service.

The money will be used to provide free cancer screening and diagnosis into 2017, as well as the provision of healthcare services to families affected by cancer.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the couple's children, also pledged £10m to the network in the wake of their father's death in May from cancer. Their mother, the Queen, has pledged £1m.

The money will be used to provide free cancer screening and diagnosis into 2017

The Queen's Speech also announced that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be the patron and honorary patron of the Royal Foundation for Cancer Research. The foundation will work to improve the quality of life for cancer survivors by providing support services to people at risk of the disease and encouraging the public to be more aware of the potential health risks.

The Queen will also be the patron and honorary patron of the Royal Foundation for Cancer Research, which is expected to work to improve the quality of life for cancer survivors by providing support services to people at risk of the disease and encouraging the public to be more aware of the potential health risks.

The Prince of Wales will be patron of the Royal Foundation for Cancer Research.

In the Queen's Speech, the Queen said: 'The Royal Family is deeply affected by the death of our son.

'They have been so close to him and so loving and supportive. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have been a wonderful example of how to fight the disease and the pain it can cause.

'The Royal Foundation for Cancer Research will enable us to continue to do everything we can to support those who are affected by cancer.'

ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss man who traveled to Syria to fight alongside Islamic State fighters was sentenced on Wednesday to eight years in jail with a minimum of five years.

The Syrian man, who was arrested in July 2015, had been under surveillance for more than a year by Swiss and German authorities as they considered whether he posed a threat to Switzerland.

He had traveled to Syria from his hometown of Zug, a small city near Zurich, at the end of 2014. He said he had gone to Syria to join Islamic State.

The terrorism court said he, along with three other people, had been carrying out reconnaissance missions in Syria.

It said the man was seen in an Islamic State video in June 2015 with two other people and in a city near Aleppo in November 2015, armed with Kalashnikovs.

The court said he had been in contact with Islamic State sympathizers in the Swiss canton of Valais, who were helping him to travel.

The court said he had been involved in a plot to blow up a Swiss military training center near Geneva and had admitted his involvement in the plot and had been planning to carry out an attack in Switzerland.

The man had been living in the Swiss canton of Valais with his parents and siblings, the court said.<|endoftext|>Early last year, I started trying to figure out how to get a handle on some of the infrastructure and infrastructure-related issues that I had been hearing about from my contacts at AdRoll. This was a great place to start, as the folks there have been able to provide a lot of information on the various things that can go wrong when you launch a large-scale ad network.

One of their most popular topics was the issue of load balancers and load balancing. I had been hearing the same things from my contacts, and so I figured it would be a good time to do some research and port some of the things that I heard to use in my own ad network.

Initial Setup

The first thing I did was to go ahead and port the AdRoll Load Balancing. The first question that I had was "What's the difference between AdRoll and AdSense?" Well, AdRoll has been around for quite a while and is one of the bigger players in the space. It has quite a bit more number of customers and other partners than AdSense, but they're not as big. They are also a pretty good competitor, with a lot of competitors out there.

One key difference between AdRoll and AdSense, is that AdRoll has a lot more features than AdSense. For instance, AdSense only supports CPM (Cost per Click) and maximum CPC (Maximum Ad Revenue). AdRoll supports both of these, as well as other more complex features like automatic retargeting and ad server billing.

While AdRoll's customer service is great, the company has been very slow to respond to my questions. I had to wait a good while before I really had any type of response. On the plus side, AdRoll recently changed the way they respond to emails, so I had a better response rate this time around.

Once I got my first response, it was almost instant. AdRoll was able to provide me with an automated script that would set up my load balancer.

Make sure you read the following blog post if you haven't already.

Install AdRoll and Load Balancing

Once you have the script installed, it's the same process all over again. First you will need to create a new instance of AdRoll, then add some settings to get it ready to support AdSense.

Setting Up AdRoll

After creating a new instance of AdRoll, you will notice that it already has a bunch of settings. Before you can add any settings, you will need to add a "default" store. This stores all your AdSense Ad IDs and categories, as well as all the links that you want to show when someone clicks on an AdSense ad.

If you want to add your own store or categories, then you will need to go to the AdRoll Admin page and go to the Add New Store page.

Once you have a store set up, you will need to decide what Ad ID and categories you want to show. You can enter a few options here (such as "Ads by Category", "Ads by Display Category" and "Ads by Name").

After you've entered all the Ad IDs and categories that you want to show, you will need to create a security group. Similar to how you set up the store, you will need to create a security group for your AdSense Ad IDs.

You will need to create a security group for your AdSense Ad IDs.

Once you have a security group set up, you can then choose which AdSense Ad IDs and categories you want to show on your load balancer.

This page is about the game mode. For the area, see Region.


Region (the "real" name of the game mode) is a game mode that allows players to play against each other. Players compete in a single game, and the player who lost the game is eliminated. A game can have numerous players; however, only one player will be selected to play each game.

The game mode is based on a simple map, and the only non-player objects are the few buildings on the map. (The "building" is a simple wooden structure, such as a house.) The player chooses the starting location, and the map is randomly generated.

The game mode is played with 32 players against 32 AI opponents each.

Each player starts with a certain amount of money, and in the case of two players, each player has a personal amount of money.

Players are allowed to use up to three types of vehicles in the game mode.

There are no rules for the number of players, except for the number of buildings allowed.

There are no rules for the amount of money each player starts with. The amount of money a player starts with is determined from the starting point, which is determined by the player's starting place, and the amount of money spent on items and starting buildings. The starting point is determined by the amount of money spent on household items, as well as the starting house.

1.2.1. Starting Point

If no starting house is available, the player may choose a random starting point. If a player chooses a starting point that is not within the current region, they will be moved to the nearest region.

1.2.2. Starting House

Players may start with any of the three starting houses, or with a random house. The starting house is determined by the player, and the house displayed in the game is random.

1.2.3. House Construction

Each player is allowed to build one house per turn, with the exception that no more than one house in the game can be built at one time. When a player builds a house, they can only build one house per turn.

1.2.4. House Building

Each house has three components: a house, a trap, and a shop. The shop provides the player with items that can be purchased from a shopkeeper. Traps are placed on the map and can be destroyed by other players. Houses can be destroyed by players, buildings, or traps.

1.2.5. House Destruction

Each house can be destroyed by players, traps, or buildings. When a house is destroyed, it is removed from the map, and the player who destroyed it receives money.

1.2.6. Building Construction

Each building has 3 components: a building, a shop, and a trap. When a building is built, it can be placed in a random location on the map. When a house is destroyed, it is removed from the map. If a building is destroyed, the player who destroyed it receives money.

1.2.7. Trap Construction

Each trap has 3 components: a trap, and a shop. When a trap is placed, it can be placed in a random location on the map. When a house is destroyed, it is removed from the map. If a trap is destroyed, the player who destroyed it receives money.

1.2.8. Shop Construction

Each shop has 3 components: a shopkeeper, and a building. When a shopkeeper is placed, the shopkeeper provides the player with the type of building that is currently being built. When a building is placed, the building can be built. When a trap is placed, it can be placed in a random location on the map. When a house is destroyed, it is removed from the map. If a trap is destroyed, the player who destroyed it receives money.

1.2.9. Store Construction

Each store has 3 components: a storehouse, a shop, and a trap. When a storehouse is placed, the storehouse provides a house. When a shop is placed, the shopkeeper provides the type of building that is currently being built. When a building is placed, the building can be built. When a trap is placed, it can be placed in a random location on the map. When a house is destroyed, it is removed from the map. If a trap is destroyed, the player who destroyed it receives money.

1.2.10. House Construction

Each house has 3 components: a house, a trap, and a shop. When a house is destroyed, it is removed from the map. If a trap is destroyed, the player who destroyed it receives money.

Tunisia's interim president has claimed that the country's new constitution is "free and fair".

Mohamed Brahmi made the comments after the Constitutional Court issued its verdict on an initiative by an opposition group which seeks to amend the constitution.

The court decided that the constitution "contains a number of articles in which the rights and liberties of citizens are violated" and ordered the government to put out a new draft constitution within 30 days.

Brahmi has since been moved to the post of prime minister.

According to the constitution, the interim government must issue a new draft constitution by August 9.

The constitution was drafted by the Constituent Assembly in the wake of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011.

It has been widely criticised by human rights groups, who say it is not up to scratch and contains many unconstitutional clauses.

The new constitution was approved by a two-thirds majority in the Assembly of the Republic in June.<|endoftext|>With the release of the new Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, Microsoft has provided a number of new features to help make the new convertible devices more productive.

The new Surface Pen features a retractable mechanism that allows it to be easily tucked inside the cover for protection. The new Surface Pro 4 has a new Surface Dial with three new working positions: Display, Accessory and Convergence. The Surface Dial can also open up to six apps at once.

There is a new color option for the new Surface Pro 4 with 3D Touch, which Microsoft has named Glance. The recent release of the new Surface Book has a new color option as well, but the new color is still not available today.

Microsoft has also added a new feature to the new Surface Pro 4, which is a new feature called Mixed Reality. Microsoft has been working on this for quite some time and I'm sure it will be a huge selling feature for users. The mixed reality feature allows users to use the Surface Pro 4 like a PC for a number of tasks by using the Surface Pen and Surface Dial. As we are seeing today, the new Surface Pro 4 has a new color option for this feature as well, which Microsoft has named Prism.

Windows 10 will be available to consumers starting October 17th and the new Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book will be available in November.

The study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, found that having a history of marijuana use in the past year, or having used marijuana more than once per week, can increase the risk of depression by up to 21 percent.

In addition, the study found that students who use marijuana daily or several times per week are at an increased risk of having depression, anxiety and other mental health issues.

The study, which examined data from more than 60,000 young adults, is the first to examine the possible relation between marijuana use and mental health in a large population.

The researchers found that students who reported using marijuana daily or several times a week were up to three times more likely to have depression than those who reported using marijuana less than once a week. On the other hand, students who reported marijuana use less than once a week were at no increased risk for depression.

The study also found that those who had experienced a mental health problem before the age of 18 were twice as likely to have used marijuana in the past year. Students who had been diagnosed with a mental health problem before the age of 18 were also twice as likely to report using marijuana in the past year.

"There are a lot of people who have negative opinions about marijuana," said lead author Dr. Lori Andrews, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan. "But this study is strong evidence that there is something about marijuana use that's associated with mental health issues."

"It's a serious public health concern," Andrews added. "We need to be more aware of the risks associated with marijuana use."

The study also found that marijuana use during the past year was associated with an increased likelihood of mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. However, the study's authors note that marijuana use during the past year only increased the risk for depression by up to 21 percent.

"It's important to be aware of the risk," Andrews said. "Marijuana use may not be as bad as people think."

Mudcrab

Mudcrab (or Mudcrab) is a type of swamp dwelling, found in the swamps of the Summerset Isles. Mudcrabs can be found in groups and on the ground. They have only one model; however, they will become increasingly more detailed as you travel. If you kill one, it will drop the Mudcrab's Shell, a unique armor set that can be crafted by a blacksmith with the appropriate ingredients. Mudcrabs are able to be tamed, but they will not follow you. Mudcrabs will move away from you if they are attacked, and can only be petted in certain areas. Mudcrabs will not attack anything unless you shoot or crush them.

Mudcrabs are found in swamps on the island of Vvardenfell. They can be found in the swamps around the Imperial City, the swamps near the Imperial Shipyards, and the swamps near Sadrith Mora. Mudcrabs can be found throughout the game, but only in the swamps. They can be found in the Swamp Forest, and can be hunted down in Vvardenfell. Mudcrabs can be found in the swamp forests of the Alik'r Desert, and in the swamps of the Mournhold District.

The Mudcrab who is protecting the Mudcrab's Shell

Mudcrabs, like most of the creatures in Morrowind, have a great deal of dialogue. Most of these conversations will be generated by the Mudcrab, and are addressed to him.

I'm sorry to see you go." The Mudcrab: "There are few things more dangerous in this world than a Mudcrab. However, there is only one way to get to the Shell. After you have killed all the Mudcrabs, return to me."

Mudcrab: "What's wrong, friend? I thought you were still out on the road. It's been a while since you last saw me. What, are you looking for me? Or you're looking for a Mudcrab?" The Mudcrab: "The Shell is not for sale. I will only give it away to those who are worthy. I have no desire to see another Mudcrab. I've hunted them for so long I am tired."

However, there is only one way to get to the Shell. After you have killed all the Mudcrabs, return to me."

Mudcrab: "My friend, how long have you been out here? It's been so long. You've been out for so long. So long, I thought you were dead." The Mudcrab: "I am not dead. I am a Mudcrab. I was out on the road looking for my Shell, and have only returned to the swamps. I have not seen you for so long. You must have found it, then. That is why I am here. I have protected the Shell for so long, and it is time to make my return."

The Mudcrab: "Mudcrab! I have no longer any need for you. You have served me well, and I do not wish to see you again." The Mudcrab: "My friend, I am not at all pleased to see you. I have protected the Shell for so long, and it is time to make my return."

In the wake of a shooting that took place at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Republicans are trying to pass the most conservative abortion bills they can in the wake of the tragedy.

Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

The most important bill is that of Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., which would prohibit abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, in which a fetus is considered viable outside the womb. Republicans have said they want to pass the measure to obtain more conservative votes, but also to show the public and women back home in Arizona that they are still trying to protect women's health.

But the language of the bill has riled activists and Democrats. The bill would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy unless the mother's life is in danger, or the pregnancy poses a risk to her health. It would require doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, and would also make it easier to put abortion in the hands of health care providers.

"This bill, as written, would make Arizona the most restrictive state in the nation," said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. "It would ban abortion after 20 weeks, and it would require doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. And while we may not want to be in the business of aborting babies at 20 weeks, the reality is that this is exactly what Arizona does every day."

The bill has already been passed by the Arizona House, with the support of both Democrats and Republicans. On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill. If the bill passes the full Senate, it will likely be the focus of a floor debate.

The other, more controversial legislation is the so-called "personhood" bill, which would ban abortion and ban most forms of birth control, even in cases of rape and incest, for the life of the pregnant woman. Many women's health advocates have been opposed to the legislation, saying it would criminalize abortion.

"If you are a woman, who wants a decision, you should be able to make it," said Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Sierra Vista. "You should not be punished for making a decision."

The personhood bills are expected to be considered in the House and Senate in the next few weeks.<|endoftext|>The phrase "Make America Great Again" is being used by Donald Trump to convince Americans that he has the skills to be the next leader of the free world, but a new poll reveals that Americans are not convinced he is the right man for the job.

The billionaire has been leading the Republican field in polls for about two months, but his support has been falling over the past month. A CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday found Trump trailing Marco Rubio in Florida, and in second place in New Hampshire.

Trump earned the support of 30 percent of Republican primary voters in the poll. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R), who suspended his campaign last month, earned the support of 19 percent, and Rubio got 18 percent.

[CNN]<|endoftext|>U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor pilots take a break from flying and take a sea-level selfie as they practice for a joint air combat exercise in Alaska.

On Tuesday, the Air Force announced a new "launch community" that will include as many as 15,000 military and civilian technologists and scientists. The new move is part of the military's longstanding effort to break down the technological barriers that often prevent a combat aircraft from launching on its own — a problem that has persisted for decades, as the Pentagon constantly tries to find ways to get the F-22 or F-35 fighters to land on their own, including through the use of GPS (global positioning system) signals.

"I think it's a good thing, in a way," said retired Marine Gen. James Cartwright, who served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Bush administration. "Most of the time, a lot of the time, the [space-based launch system] is in a position where it's a lot easier to land the aircraft."

"The aircraft gets to the airfield, the aircraft gets to the runway, the aircraft gets to the aircraft," he said. "That's what the F-22 and F-35 are all about. They're not about doing whatever the last guy was doing."

But the launch community also could help solve another problem that has dogged the Air Force for decades: The lack of a way to launch an aircraft in the middle of the night, when the vast majority of U.S. civilian air traffic is grounded. The service has tried using GPS signals to launch aircraft, but the technology has proven to be less reliable than its military counterparts.

"I don't know of any other country that can launch a satellite in the middle of the night," said Frank Kendall, the

Which is why the GOP is engaged in the game of chicken it plays with itself over the debt ceiling.

The difference between the knowns and the unknowns is that the unknowns are much bigger than the knowns, and the GOP knows it. The president went on TV yesterday to make his case to Republicans that if they do not agree to raise the debt ceiling by the October 17 deadline, the U.S. will default on its debt.

Where do Republicans stand?

The GOP knows that if the debt ceiling is not raised it will be a political disaster. And the president knows that if it is not raised, he will be able to claim that the GOP is refusing to raise the debt ceiling to protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.

Republicans know that if they do not agree to raise the debt ceiling they will be blamed for jeopardizing the economy. And the president knows that if he does not agree to raise the debt ceiling, he will be able to claim that the GOP has refused to raise the debt ceiling to protect the middle class.

(CNN) — It's a strange feeling to be so close to death, to see so many of your friends dying, to feel so alone, but to also feel so much joy.

That's how I felt when I was run over by a taxi in Istanbul.

I had just finished my first independent music festival, yet the adrenaline rush I felt after my first gig was still there. I felt exhilarated and exhilarated.

It was a football stadium in the center of Istanbul, and I was out at a party with a group of friends. I had a friend with me, a Norwegian, so we sat down in one of the seats in the crowd.

When the song was over, we moved to the front, where everyone was sitting. We all started dancing. So did the taxi driver behind us.

I didn't even notice how much he was speeding up. Then suddenly, the taxi slammed on its brakes.

We all started screaming.

It was a very scary moment, and I started to wonder whether I would make it out alive.

I looked down. I was looking at the ground. I had no idea whether I had broken my neck, but I didn't feel any pain. I was just really confused.

I asked my friend to check on me. He told me to look up. The taxi came to a stop. It was a garbage truck. The driver got out, and then my friend ran over and used the back of his hand to poke my neck. I was still looking up at the ground.

I didn't feel any pain. I was just really confused.

I didn't move.

The garbage truck driver came back and punched me in the face. He was yelling, "You're dead!"

I was so confused. I didn't know what to do. I was just so very confused. I didn't know whether I was alive or not.

He hit me again. I started panicking. I was still looking up, this time at the ground, expecting to see flowers. Instead, I saw blood. The driver started punching me in the face again.

He broke my nose.

He threw me out of the truck.

I'm still alive. It's a miracle.

I looked up and saw my friends. They had taken me to the hospital, and they had all been in a panic.

One of my friends was crying. She said, "The police are here. They're here. They're here." And they came. I don't know what they did, but I don't know what happened to me.

But I'm alive. I'm alive.

The way the media has covered the ongoing saga of the JonBenet Ramsey murder case in the last few days has been disturbing.

The media has essentially jumped on the bandwagon for the parents' legal team, outraged at any mention of the possibility that JonBenet may have been murdered.

The media has called this an "investigative" story, with the media referring to the parents as "investigators" even though they have not even interviewed a single person with any knowledge of the case.

The media has called this a "discovery" story, with the media referring to the parents as "discovery experts."

The media has called this a "federal case," with the media referring to the parents as "federal investigators."

The media has called this a "JonBenet Ramsey" case, with the media referring to the parents as "JonBenet Ramsey investigators."

The media has referred to the parents as "investigators," as though they're the ones actually investigating the case.

At this point, this is an "investigation" that is like any other "investigation" — it's a case in which the media has been given an overwhelming amount of media access and the ability to interview people who know anything about the case.

The media has been given access to the Ramsey family's home, their apartment complex, and their private investigator.

"The first time I came to the US was with my family back in 1983. We met at a hotel in Santa Anna, California, and the first day I came I was in the middle of a serious car accident," Jennifer said. "I was in a coma for three days and I had to walk with a cane, but my family and I were in a hotel room and I had a cell phone, so I started making call after call to my family in Mexico. I told them to come by the hospital and see how I was doing and that I wanted to come home. I said, 'I'm in a hospital, I want to come home.' "

Jennifer's story is a common one. She is not exaggerating when she says she was in a coma for three days.

"The doctors said, 'You need to be in a hospital, you need to be in a hospital.' But we couldn't afford it and they wouldn't let us go," she said. Jennifer was finally stabilized when she was transferred to the University of California in San Francisco and then to UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles.

"I felt like I was in a dream," she said. "It was like I was in a different world. I didn't know if I was going to wake up. I didn't know if I was going to wake up."

Jennifer said that the doctors were surprised that she was able to speak.

"I was really babbling," she said. "They were like, 'What is this?' 'Are you OK?' I said, 'I'm OK.' They were just trying to figure out what was going on."

Jennifer remembers the level of difficulty she faced when she first arrived in the United States.

"I was so scared," she said. "When I first got to the hospital they didn't know where to put me. There was no bed, so they put me in the bathroom."

She said that she was also a little confused about the language barrier.

"I tried to ask the doctor if he was a lawyer or a doctor. 'Are you a doctor or a lawyer?' And he was like, 'I don't know.' He asked me what I was wearing and if I had a driver's license. I had no idea," Jennifer said.

She also remembers being a little overwhelmed when she first got to UCLA Medical Center.

"I had no idea what to do and I wasn't sure what was going on. I had no idea what was going on," she said. "I was sick with worry."

Jennifer is in good health now. She said that she is still on medication and that she has regained her voice. She said that she is a little more emotional now and that she is excited to be back in the United States.

"I'm very grateful that I am here," she said. "I'm very thankful for what I have."<|endoftext|>Hugh Jackman is facing the loss of his Australian passport after he was found in breach of the country's rules on dual citizenship.

The demonstrations of the past few weeks have been a mix of peaceful and violent protests, with some of the peaceful protesters facing off with police and being tear gassed.

So in the wake of the protests, the National Center for Science Education has posted a video of the University of Missouri protesting, as well as a video of a protest in Portland, Oregon. The Center is an organization that promotes science education, and it has posted videos on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube about several topics.

Sebastian Rönnquist's Shipyard

an interactive experience about the history and future of the shipyard

Sebastian Rönnquist's Shipyard is an interactive experience about the history and future of the shipyard in the city of Malmö, Sweden and its relationship with the world.

Transformation of the shipyard was a huge task. During the 19th century it was the largest shipyard in Europe. In the 20th century it was a focus of industrialization and of the post-war growth of Sweden. Today the shipyard is in decline. Its history and future will be told through an interactive experience in the harbour of Malmö.

The shipyard is the hub of industry in Malmö and the ninth largest private employer in Malmö County.

The most famous shipyards of the world are located in the United States. At one time most of the world's largest ships were made in the US shipyards, but the US in recent years has been declining in importance.

It's been about five years since I first started playing League of Legends, and I have come to the conclusion that I have no interest in playing competitively, unless it's to help out a friend. I've been reading a lot about the competitive scene, and I've decided to put my ideas into practice.

I've started by filing the kids off to school on time, and then went to sleep. I woke up, and as I sat on my bed, I realized that I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I started reading as many articles and watching videos of competitive play as I could. I started playing the game again, trying to figure out what works for me. I started a blog, and I began talking about the meta, and how I would play it. I realized that there was no way I could play my own game, so I decided to join a team.

The team I joined was called Team Legion. We were a very strong team, and we dominated the NA scene in Season 2. We won our first tournament, a 4v4 bracket, and it felt like a victory for ourselves. We were so happy that we were able to win, and we knew that we could not only win, but dominate the regional scene. We were the kings of NA.

And then I thought about what it would take to win a tournament. I felt like I had been playing the game for so long, and I had gotten pretty good at it. How could I not be good? I was a dedicated player, and I had been playing about five to six hours a day. I had a good understanding of the game, and I knew what it felt like to win. I had a ton of confidence in my play, and I felt confident in my team.

I was getting into the groove of the game, and I was getting to the point where I felt I could win more than I lost. I was beginning to think that perhaps I was going to be good at this game.

But then I started to read what was written in the forums, and I was appalled. There were people posting about how they were struggling to get into the competitive scene, and how they had been left behind. The community was full of people that were doing well, and were being left behind. Some of them were even talking about quitting the game.

That was when I realized that there was a big problem in the community. I couldn't believe that I had done so well in the game, and I couldn't believe that I was leaving so many players behind. I started to feel a bit bitter about the game, and I started to think that perhaps I should leave the game. But through some research, I decided that I needed to stay in the game. I needed to keep improving, and I needed to keep playing.

I decided that I wouldn't quit, that I would continue playing. I had been playing so long, and I had learned so much since I became a pro player. I had gotten a ton of experience, and I was confident that I could continue to improve.

I did keep playing. I wouldn't quit. I wanted to win, and I was willing to do whatever it took to win. I felt like I was doing pretty well in the competitive scene, but I knew that there was much more to the game than just winning. I wanted to be the best that I could be, and I wanted to help as many players as I could. I was just a pretty bad player before I started playing League of Legends, so I knew that I had a lot to work on.

As I started to play more games in solo queue, I started to see the difference that playing with a team made. I would start to see better plays, and I was able to help out some of the weaker players. That was when it hit me. I realized that I wasn't as bad as I had been making myself out to be. I realized that I was improving, and I was starting to do well in the competitive scene. I was beginning to feel like I had achieved something, and I was beginning to think that maybe I could be better than I was.

That was when I decided to leave the game, and I will never play another competitive game. I will never waste my time watching League of Legends videos or reading articles about the competitive scene. I will never play for the sake of playing for the sake of playing. I will never play for the money. I am going to play only as a hobby, and my goal is to help as many people as I can.

I will never be a better player than I was before I started playing League of Legends. I am going to put all of my efforts into helping as many people as I can. I want to help them become better than they are, and I want to help them become better than I was. I want to help them play at the highest level

The only thing that would make SEGA and Sega Mega Drive fans happier is if the developer of Sonic CD and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 succeeds in making a Sonic 3 and a Mega Drive remake.

That would be great.

That's what SEGA of America President and CEO Scott Rohde told Bloomberg.

"This is a big opportunity for us," he said. "We have the best fans at SEGA of America."

"It doesn't matter if we don't make a Sonic 3 and a Mega Drive remake," he added. "It's a great opportunity for us."

Sega fans have been clamoring for a remaster of the two Sega classic games since they were first released in the late '90s.

The games were released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1996 and 1997, and the Genesis in 1999. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released for the Sega Saturn in 2002.

The games introduce many new elements not seen in their predecessors. Most notably, they introduce the Chaos Emeralds, which are used to power up your character.

Sonic 3 and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 were remastered for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, respectively, in 2012.

Hopefully, a new Sonic 3 and Mega Drive remake will follow.

It's been a while since we heard anything about a new Sonic game.

The last Sonic game, Sonic Generations, was released in 2013. It was met with mixed reviews, and you can read all about it right here.

And a Sonic the Hedgehog 2 remake wasn't announced until 2013.

The final Sonic game, Sonic Mania, was released in 2016.

So, what about a new Sonic 3 and Mega Drive remake?<|endoftext|>A few days ago, I was at a Friendsgiving for my daughters and I was chatting with a friend about the big trip we are planning in a few weeks. A day later, she sent me this email:

Here is a link to the book I wrote for my daughters. It is called "New to Mama."

I've shared it with many of my friends and they are loving it! If you need a quick and easy book to introduce your girls to motherhood, this one is for you.

It is written by a mom who has done it all of the things I did. I wrote it for my daughters, but it could be used by any girl.

I still have many of the recipes from my first book, and I am posting the recipes here in one place so that you can easily find them. Like the ones below.

CHICAGO -- The Chicago Bears were the first team to publicly welcome former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim Harbaugh, who is now the San Francisco 49ers' head coach, to town.

"We're excited about it," Bears coach John Fox said. "We've met twice in the last two days. He's a great guy, a great player and a great coach. I've had a good opportunity to see him a couple times over the last two days and I've got a lot of respect for him. I think it's going to be a great fit for both teams."

Harbaugh took over the 49ers' head coaching job in January, after serving as the 49ers' offensive coordinator for the past two seasons. He was also the 49ers' quarterbacks coach for the past two seasons.

"It's a great opportunity for me," Harbaugh said. "I'm so excited, I'm pumped up. I'm a little nervous, but I'm excited. I'm just ready to get in."

Harbaugh called the Bears the "perfect team" to call home.

"I'm excited about it," Harbaugh said. "I've met with [Bears general manager] Ryan Pace and [Bears head coach John Fox] and they've been great. They've been very encouraging and very supportive. I'm just ready to get in and get started."

Fox called Harbaugh "an outstanding football coach."

"Jim is a tremendous football coach," Fox said. "He's a tremendous person. He's a tremendous person to work for. He's a terrific motivator. He's a terrific teacher. He's a terrific leader. He's an outstanding recruiter. He's a terrific teacher. He's a terrific student. He's a terrific player. He's a terrific leader. He's been great to work with. I think he's a great coach. He'll be a great leader, I can tell you that."

Harbaugh is also excited about the new teammates he'll be working with in Chicago.

"I just met with [linebacker] Danny Trevathan, [safety] Adrian Amos, [linebacker] Pernell McPhee," Harbaugh said. "I've been to [safety] Eddie Jackson's house. It's a great football town. It's a great place for me to be and a great place for us to start."

The 49ers have yet to make their final moves to fill their coaching staff, but Harbaugh said he will make his decision on whether to remain with the 49ers before the end of the week.

"It'll be a decision before the end of the week," Harbaugh said.

Harbaugh said he is not sure if he will be discussing his future with the 49ers.

"I'm not sure," Harbaugh said. "I've been asked that question a couple times in the last couple days. I'm not sure. I don't know."

Her book, "Going Rogue," published in 2011, was a game-changer. It was not merely one of the most popular books of the year; it was also a manifesto of sorts for the Tea Party movement. It denounced Obamacare, the stimulus, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Iraq War, the bailouts of Wall Street, the "foreign policy of weakness" and "the globalist agenda of the Obama administration." It was the Tea Party movement's "de-facto manifesto."

It is now 2014. The Tea Party has a president, and it has a Senate minority leader, but it has no real power. It has no legislative agenda. Its policies continue to be rejected by the American people. There is no movement. There is no central authority. There is no "Tea Party" that can mobilize itself and throw off the control of the Republican Party's establishment.

The Tea Party is now on life support. The Republican Party has a Republican president, and it has a Republican Senate majority. Yet the Tea Party is not growing. It is in danger of disappearing. It is on the verge of extinction.

One of the reasons it is on the verge of extinction is that the Tea Party's core principle, and the reason it was able to survive during the Obama years, is that it was a true grass-roots movement. It was not a network of lobbyists. It was not a party controlled by professional activists. It was a grassroots movement, a movement brought together by a few committed ideologues.

Even the most combative and conservative Republican primary voters could not bring themselves to vote for John McCain, who was too much of a product of Washington's power elite to be the outsider. They were fiercely opposed to Mitt Romney's pro-corporate, pro-Wall Street agenda. Yet they were

A new wave of anti-immigration rhetoric is sweeping across Europe.

The latest is Italy, which is facing a major influx of migrants from North Africa.

Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano has issued a decree, making it a crime for migrants to be in the country without a visa.

In an interview with the Times of London, he said that the new law will help deal with the growing problem of migrants, adding that the government has already set up a task force to deal with the issue.

"There is a problem and we have to deal with it," he said.

Around 40,000 migrants have already arrived in Italy this year, and the expected number this year could be more than 65,000, the BBC reported.

In Germany, the most populous country in the EU, the rising tide of anti-immigrant sentiment has reached breaking point.

Germany earlier this month passed a controversial law that makes it illegal for asylum seekers to seek asylum in the country if they have been to a country of concern.

The law was met with fierce opposition from human rights groups and immigrant rights groups, who slammed it as "cruel, inhuman and illegal."

In Britain, the Conservative Party is promising to bring in a law to make it a crime for migrants to seek asylum in the U.K. if they have been to a country of concern, like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

"I do want to make it clear that we do not want to send the wrong signal to people who are genuinely fleeing danger, but we do need to be clear," Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said in a statement. "We want to send a clear message that we are a country that will treat those who have come to us in our country with dignity and respect."

The SEC has the most promising freshman class in recent memory. The SEC has been churning out talented players for years; with so many talented players and so few spots to play them, the mood is particularly encouraging for the upcoming season.

Take a look at the top 10 players of the 2016 class, and the top five players that will make the biggest impact this season.

1. Jalen Tabor, CB, Florida

Tabor is the top cover corner in the draft class, and it's hard to argue with him. He has the size, speed and football IQ to be a top cover corner in the NFL, and he could be a first-round selection if he continues to improve. Tabor has excellent ball skills, and his physicality in run support makes him a potential playmaker. He will likely start off in the slot for Florida, but can do so much more.

Tabor was a ballhawk at the combine, running a 4.46-second 40-yard dash. That time could help him stand out as an early-round pick. He showcased that ability at the Rebels' pro day, running a 4.45 and 4.54 40-yard dashes.

2. D'haquille Williams, CB, Mississippi State

Williams is the top corner on the board and a potential first-round pick if he continues to develop. The Mississippi State product is a tough cover corner, and he has the speed and ball skills to keep up with receivers on the outside. Williams is a good tackler for his size, and he can play press-man coverage or off-man coverage. He is extremely competitive, and he can play with power or speed. Williams is a natural ballhawk who can play against the run, and he has the athleticism to do so.

Williams was a top performer at the Combine, running a 4.37-second 40-yard dash. He is strong at the catch point, and he played well at the Senior Bowl and the NFL Scouting Combine. Williams has the size and speed to be a top cover corner in the league, and he should be able to step in right away at the next level.

3. Deiondre' Hall, WR, Ohio State

Hall is a physical receiver who could be a great complement to Amari Cooper. Hall was a consistent performer at Ohio State's pro day, running a 4.47 40-yard dash. He is a long strider who has outstanding speed and ball skills, and he has the instincts to be a perfect complement to Cooper. Hall can use his size to his advantage, and he has the size to win jump balls. He could be a very good No. 2 receiver in the NFL.

4. Malik McDowell, DT, Michigan State

McDowell is a dominant interior player who will be a top-10 pick if he continues to develop. He has the presence and strength to anchor against the run, but he has the athleticism to be a good outside pass rusher. McDowell has great hands and can make plays in the open field. He has developed into a very good run defender at Michigan State, and he has the strength and athleticism to be a force in the middle of the defensive line.

5. Quincy Wilson, CB, Florida

Wilson is a top-notch cover corner who should be a top-10 pick in this class. He is the best overall cover corner in this class. Wilson is a physical corner who can play press coverage or off-man coverage. He can play outside or in the slot, and he has excellent ball skills. He is an aggressive and competitive player who will terrorize quarterbacks.

6. Dalvin Tomlinson, DT, Alabama

Tomlinson has very good strength and power, and he has a great motor. It's no surprise he's considered one of the top players in the draft. He has the size and speed to be a force in the middle of the defensive line, and he can be disruptive against the run. Tomlinson is a strong run defender who can make plays against the run. He has good feet and excellent balance, and he can play with power or speed.

7. Zach Cunningham, LB, Vanderbilt

Cunningham is a strong run defender who can disrupt plays from the middle of the field. He combines great speed and explosive power with good instincts. He's a good fit for Jim McElwain's defense, and he has the athleticism and speed to be a disruptive force in the middle of the defense. Cunningham has a very good work ethic and is a team captain.

8. Marlon Humphrey, CB, Alabama

Humphrey is a physical cornerback who is a good ballhawk and a good tackler. He has the size and speed to be a good cover corner in the NFL, and he has the ability to be a good tackler in the run game. Humphrey has

Konstantin Stolyarov isn't just a Russian chess player. He's also a political activist. And the country is paying attention.

Konstantin Stolyarov is a chess master in Russia, and he's been in the spotlight ever since his name was mentioned on the U.S. intelligence community's list of people who might have been "co-opted" by Russian intelligence.

The list was released in January, and it included names of close friends and business associates of President Trump. Stolyarov's name wasn't mentioned.

But that changed on Monday.

Stolyarov spoke with the Russian news network RT about the list and about his experience as a Soviet-era fighter pilot before being recruited by the KGB, according to The Telegraph.

"It is clear that the U.S. intelligence agency has put a lot of attention on me," Stolyarov told RT. "I have no doubt that they are trying to turn me into an enemy of the state."

The list included other sources of political discomfort for the U.S. — including Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, whose meeting with Donald Trump Jr. last year was described in the intelligence community's report.

Stolyarov, who is the leader of the World Chess Federation, spoke on the sidelines of a chess match in the Russian city of Novosibirsk.

"Unfortunately, my name was put on the list," Stolyarov said. "I don't know why."

But he said he had no intention of quitting chess. "I can't quit chess," he told The Telegraph. "I'm going to keep playing and fighting for chess."

Stolyarov, who studied at the prestigious Moscow State University, is also a political activist. He was a member of the Federation Council of the Russian chess federation and has been involved with the United Russia party.

He's also worked on the interests of the Russian state. He's worked on parliament's Committee on Defense and has been a member of the Constitutional Court with a view toward drafting a new constitution. He's also made public statements on behalf of the Russian government.

He's not the first chess player to have his name on the list. And he might not be the last. The list also included Russian chess grandmaster and former world champion Levon Aronian. He was also a member of the Federation Council and a member of the Constitutional Court.

But Stolyarov's name was the only one to cause a stir.

He's been a national hero in Russia, even at the expense of his own country. During the Soviet era, Stolyarov was one of the top Soviet Union players. When the Soviets went to war with Afghanistan in 1979, Stolyarov fought in the air force. But with the Soviet Union's collapse, he was drafted into the Soviet KGB.

"I was a fighter pilot, and I was put in command of an air force base," he told The Telegraph. "I was in the aviation branch of the KGB."

Stolyarov was a Soviet fighter pilot in Afghanistan in 1979. But he was being drafted into the KGB.

Stolyarov worked for the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. He was a fighter pilot in the early days of the Afghan mujaheddin uprising, according to The Telegraph. After the Soviet Union's collapse, he was sent on a mission to Iran, where he joined the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

But he was being sent to Afghanistan on a mission that was under the direction of the CIA.

"The Americans were about to invade Iran with the help of Pakistan and the Iranian government, and they were looking for some kind of resistance," Stolyarov told The Telegraph. "I was in a position to fight an insurgency."

Stolyarov lost a close friend in the fight. In 2006, he said that he was flown out of Afghanistan to Egypt to be interrogated. His friend, who was also a chess player, was also killed.

"I spent two months in an Egyptian prison, but they never released me," Stolyarov said.

He says that he was tortured.

"They put me in a cell without sunlight, without air, and I was not allowed to see my family," he said. "I was interrogated about my relationships with political figures in the United States and Europe. I was tortured. They tortured me, and I was condemned to death."

Stolyarov says that he was due to be executed in 2008.

But he was released.

"I was released because my government was afraid that if I was executed, the Islamic Republic would be destroyed," he said.

Stolyarov says he's not going to stop fighting for chess.

"I have a dream, and I continue to work on it," he said.

Stolyarov won the

According to an arrest report, the boy was "not cooperative" with responding officers and "was being extremely disruptive to the officers involved," Const. Jim O'Grady said.

The boy's identity has not been released, but O'Grady said he is a 16-year-old male.

The boy was identified by the Hamilton County prosecutor's office as Antonio D. Smith.

A preliminary hearing for the boy is set for May 4.

The incident began after Smith allegedly ran from police and tried to break into a woman's apartment on the 1300 block of East McCord Street. A bystander called police about 12:45 a.m.

Officers arrived and told Smith to stop but he kept escaping.

At that point, an officer had to shoot Smith twice, hitting him in the upper torso, O'Grady said.

Smith was taken to UC Medical Center, where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries.

He was charged with aggravated riot, resisting arrest, and obstructing official business.<|endoftext|>An aerial view of the construction site for the $3.4 billion (3.3 billion euro) Eurostar terminal at St. Pancras International. (AFP/Getty Images)

PARIS — The European Union has got a new enemy: French political parties.

As the bloc argues over how to continue building its rail network after Brexit, France's center-right government has been driving a hard bargain with the country's political parties.

In return for a series of concessions, the government has been offering more spending on social programs, including generous pensions for the elderly and more free day care for children.

The French government is also offering the parties generous concessions on reforms to labor laws, which are a key sticking point.

"The European Union needs to get its head together," said Arnaud Montebourg, a leader of the main opposition Socialist Party, who has made the fight over the EU's future a key plank of his campaign.

"There is no question but that France is the most important country in Europe, and it's the only one that has made its voice heard," he said in a recent interview. "The French are angry."

The government's latest concessions — at the end of last week — include a deal to extend a program that gives state-subsidized day care to two million children, a program that is riddled with financial problems.

The deal also makes it easier for workers to move to another country, which is a top priority for the country's labor unions.

France's unions have been at the forefront of a fight over the EU's future, and their leader, France's prime minister, Manuel Valls, has a reputation as a hardline defender of the country's traditional working class.

The new concessions to the parties are also attractive to the European Commission, which has been pushing for some of the same changes.

It is unclear how much of the package the French government will be able to deliver.

The commission has been trying to pry France out of its current funding agreement, which expires in 2022, but the government has not been quiet about its demands.

One top French government official said that Valls's "no" in the presidential election was just a negotiating tactic.

The official said the French government would not try to thwart the EU's growing populist movement, adding that France was just trying to get the best deal possible for the country.

"The French government is not trying to fight and obstruct," the official said. "We're just trying to secure the best deal for the country."

Like its counterparts in Germany and the United Kingdom, the government of France is also giving the EU a pass on the government's deep-rooted economic problems.

"Faced with the challenge of the quadruple-dip recession, the government cannot gerrymander," the official said. "We don't need to put forward a separate budget for the EU."

The official said that the politicians who raised the alarm about the crisis were not dealing with reality.

"We are dealing with a country that is in a bad liquidity situation and is in a

Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

Two of the new cases are health care workers who treated Thomas Eric Duncan, who died from the virus in Dallas this weekend, and one of them is a second health care worker who was treating Duncan as a volunteer in Monrovia, Liberia when he contracted the disease.

The new cases came to light today, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today that all four of the new cases in the United States were linked to Duncan.

But there are more than 30 people in the United States who have either been in contact with Duncan or have been infected with Ebola; and so far the CDC has confirmed only 21 of them.

There are still several cases in West Africa, including one in Nigeria, where a man who died from Ebola was being treated for malaria.

Infected Health Care Workers Are Being Moved Out of the U.S.

For Now, More U.S. Ebola Cases Are Being Noticed

CDC Director Says Ebola Cases Are Increasing

The Ebola outbreak has killed more than 4,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and infected more than 13,000 elsewhere.

The World Health Organization said today that the Ebola outbreak has spread to nine countries, including Senegal, Mali and Nigeria.

The outbreak has been linked to the death of two American aid workers who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia.

The U.S. is not only concerned about the spread of the virus but the risk of contracting the disease in its healthcare workers.

A CDC official said today that the agency has not seen a case of Ebola in a U.S. healthcare worker, but they would be monitoring for any changes in protocols.

The CDC has been providing healthcare workers with protection kit and other instructions to help them protect themselves against Ebola, but the CDC said they are still actively taking steps to prevent the spread of the virus in their hospitals.

"We are taking all necessary steps to protect our healthcare workers," the CDC said.

CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden says that the agency has worked with the Health and Human Services Department to develop protocols for workers to protect themselves and to make sure they are not exposed.

Frieden says the CDC has seen no cases of Ebola in U.S. healthcare workers but he said the agency is monitoring the situation.

"We are taking all necessary steps to protect our healthcare workers, and we are doing everything we can to protect our health care workers," Frieden said.

Treatment in the U.S. for Ebola is improving, but there is still a risk that an infected healthcare worker could infect other healthcare workers who come into contact with him or her, the CDC has said.

"There is still a risk that an infected healthcare worker could infect other healthcare workers who come into contact with him or her, and other patients," Frieden said. "So we're working to identify the right protocols to be implemented across our healthcare system."

The CDC has sent teams of experts to West Africa to help determine how to protect medical workers.

The CDC has also set up a 24-hour hotline to help callers contact doctors and health care workers to check on their health.

The new cases in the U.S. include healthcare workers and family members who have had contact with Duncan, or who have been in contact with Duncan and are sick.

The first health care worker who has been confirmed to have been infected in the United States with Ebola is a female health care worker who cared for Duncan. She is now being treated at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, the hospital said.

The second new case was a man who treated Duncan, who died. The man had traveled to Liberia on his own and had not been part of the group of healthcare workers who treated Duncan.

The second health care worker who is being treated in Dallas is being isolated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital,

SCP-1514

Item #: SCP-1514

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1514 is to be kept within a standard containment locker in Site-██. Each instance of SCP-1514 is to be kept in isolation within a standard room of standard dimensions, not exceeding 100m in length or width, with no more than three (3) Foundation personnel present. At least one (1) Level 3 researcher must be present at all times. SCP-1514 is to be fed non-anomalous food equivalent to a human's daily caloric intake, and no more than one (1) (Class-B amnestics are to be administered to all personnel if any food is found to be present in SCP-1514's chamber.

Description: SCP-1514 is a container of unknown origin, approximately 13.5 cm in height by 4.8 cm in width, and 3.3 cm in depth. SCP-1514 is covered in a thick, viscous, yellowish substance that is similar in consistency to urine, except that it does not contain any trace of blood. A transparent, metallic-looking, leather-bound book is inside of it, and when an instance of SCP-1514 is placed inside of the book, it will translate it into an unknown language.

When an instance of SCP-1514 is placed in front of a speaker, it will begin to speak in a language that has not been translated to this time, although translations are made by the speaker. The word that is spoken is determined by the speaker, and is usually the name of a person, place, or thing that has been "seen" by the speaker. The speaker is then to place an object in front of the speaker's eyes, which will disappear when the speaker looks at it. When the speaker looks at the object, it will immediately disappear.

Addendum-1514-1: Demolishing SCP-1514 revealed that it is composed of dozens of small, glass, metal, and plastic objects that are interwoven throughout.

The Knicks will send D'Angelo Russell, Tim Hardaway Jr., the Brooklyn Nets' 2019 first-round pick and the Knicks' 2019 second-round pick to the Atlanta Hawks for Teague and George, league sources told ESPN's Ian Begley. The Hawks will receive the Knicks' 2019 second-round pick and the Hawks will receive the Nets' 2019 first-round pick, sources said.

Teague, 22, is averaging 19.2 points, 6.3 assists and 4.6 rebounds per game this season for the Atlanta Hawks. He has played in three All-Star Games and has won an NBA championship.

George, 26, is averaging 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game this season for the Indiana Pacers. He's been named an All-Star in two of his past three seasons.

The Indiana Pacers are the lone team in the Eastern Conference that has not made the playoffs since the 2010-11 season.

After missing the playoffs in 2015-16, the Pacers are 9-12 and currently in second place in the Eastern Conference. The Pacers will open the season against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 28.

The Knicks acquired George and Teague at the trade deadline in a blockbuster trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder.

There's that buzz again. The hits keep coming in the NFL.

It's been a crazy couple of months for the league, from the head injuries and concussions to the suspensions and player protests.

But maybe the most intriguing development in the NFL this year was the announcement last week from the league that it now has a policy to govern how players with domestic violence charges handle their legal issues.

I'm not talking about guys like Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson, who have been suspended for at least a year. I'm talking about players who are under investigation.

In the past year, the league has suspended Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson, Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell and Cowboys cornerback Morris Claiborne.

And in the past two weeks, the league has suspended Seahawks safety Earl Thomas for a game, and Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan for a game.

Of course, the suspensions were for an incident involving an off-duty cop in Seattle who was involved in a domestic dispute with a woman.

But that didn't stop the NFL from doing the right thing and suspending the players.

So what's the difference? Why did the league issue the new policy?

Here's what I know: It's about accountability, not just personal accountability.

The NFL has always given its players a second chance, even if it meant giving them a second chance after an incident. That's what the league has always done, whether the players were suspended for a year or a lifetime.

But in the past couple of months, the NFL has made it clear that it will not tolerate repeat offenders.

It's not just about the outcomes of the cases. It's also about the accountability.

It's what's behind the NFL's drastic crackdown on domestic violence. It's the most significant policy change in the league's history.

So what changed?

Well, there's no question the league is dealing with a serious problem.

The morning of the crash, investigators believed the plane had reached cruising altitude.

"The final indication was we detected some kind of energy," said Lt. Col. Daniel Dyer, a Pentagon spokesman. "We didn't know if it was a missile, a sonic boom, or something else."

A military official briefed on the investigation into the crash said the military had determined that the plane had hit the ground at an altitude of at least 5,000 feet.

The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the plane was on a routine training mission from Kadena Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo.

The official said the pilot was the same one who had flown the plane into the sea on Tuesday, and that the pilot had ejected.

The official said the plane's tail was torn from its vertical tail fin, which provided a better view of the crash site. The official said the plane had been flying at an altitude of about 5,000 feet when it crashed. The official said the plane was a civilian aircraft of Thai registry.<|endoftext|>Being a jock is generally a bad thing. But one student at the University of Colorado Boulder was able to turn that stereotype on its head by wearing a custom-made "Rape-Jock" shirt to class.

According to the Daily Camera, the student, Hailey Dawson, said she chose the shirt because she felt that it "emphasized the importance of rape culture, and how we all need to take responsibility for the environment in which we live."

Yup.

The Daily Camera reports that Dawson wore the shirt to a class on being an ally to survivors of sexual assault, and even used the phrase "rape-jock" to describe herself.

The student maintained that she made a "joke," not a statement, and was simply trying to make other students feel safe. She said:

"I was just trying to make a point and I was trying to make people feel safe. I think it was a joke, and I don't think I was trying to be offensive."

Actually,, Dawson's shirt is very offensive. It basically says that rape is a joke, and it's okay to joke about it. It says that it is acceptable to rape people without fear of repercussion, and it says that women are not able to say no—that they are "in control" of their bodies—and that it's okay to force yourself on someone, even if it's your own sister.

Dawson's rape-jock shirt is so offensive that even the Daily Camera couldn't look away. This is the same woman who walked up to a woman on the escalator and said:

"I'm a rape survivor. I was groped many times when I was a college student. I was also a victim of sexual assault at the hands of a very powerful man. And, when I got to the University of Colorado Boulder, I was raped a few times."

It's not a joke. It's not a joke at all. And it's not okay.

The Daily Camera spoke with Dawson, who said she was "deeply shaken and disturbed" by what happened. She said she was "stunned" by the Daily Camera's coverage of the story, and that she's been getting hate messages for her shirt.

"I just want this to go away," Dawson said. "I don't want any more attention."

But it's not going away.

Even if a student at the University of Colorado Boulder were to wear a shirt like Dawson's to class, they would still be representing rapists. And that's not OK.

Education Minister Vinod Tawde has written to the state education department to rework the law which mandates a uniform educational system for all schools. The new draft bill estimates that only one in five children in the country will be able to gain admission to a good school, forcing them to fail in their first year.

"Currently, many of the same textbooks are used for different schools, which can lead to inequities in learning," Tawde said in the letter, which was obtained by The Indian Express. "We will rework the Bill to make it more appropriate for different schools."

Tawde's letter was addressed to Rajiv Ranjan, the principal secretary in the department.

The Education Act, 2006, mandates that all Indian schools should follow a uniform curriculum. The provisions of the Act have been challenged in court by schools which claim that it infringes upon their freedom of education.

The government is keen to provide education to all children irrespective of

Convicted killer Anthony Ray Hinton has been charged with the rape and murder of a 21-year-old woman who disappeared in 2007.

Hinton, 70, is accused of killing Brittney Mills and raping her before dumping her body in a plastic bag in April 2007.

He appeared in court in London on Thursday to face charges of an open murder and rape and was remanded in custody.

Hinton is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court again on Monday.

Mills, from Cobham, Surrey, was last seen alive leaving a party on 1 April 2007, when she didn't return home from her shift at a restaurant.

She was found dead by her father on 25 May 2007 - and was initially believed to have had a relationship with Hinton.

But after a £1.6m appeal to find the missing woman, Hinton was charged with murder in February 2008.

Hinton was also charged with rape in October 2009, and has until now always denied the allegations.

He was detained under the Mental Health Act but released in the summer of 2013 on the condition he not leave the UK for at least five years.

Hinton was taken to the hospital for treatment in the aftermath of his arrest.

Meanwhile, Hinton's daughter, Deanna Hinton, is working to raise funds for the family in the hope her father will be released from custody.

"I have seen him (Hinton) on the news in prison and I've always been very proud of him and how he handled everything," she said.

"The fact that he's ever been charged, I'm in a bit of shock.

"I knew he had a history and as far as I know he's always been a person who has always been very sympathetic to the poor and the needy.

"I just want to be able to help him and I'm working on that to raise the money.

"It's important to me because it's an injustice to think that my dad is going to spend the rest of his life in prison. It's not fair to him."

In a statement, Deanna Hinton said: "This is the hardest time of my life and I am sure it will continue to be a very difficult time for my family and our friends."<|endoftext|>BRAZZERS 2 days full access for only 1$ show me the offer...

New York Red Bulls head coach Jesse Marsch praised the efforts of central defender Tyler Adams early in the match. "He's a great guy," Marsch said of Adams. "He's very talented. He's got a great attitude. He's a good kid."

Marsch also had high praise for his team's play after the break. "We were content with some of our work," he said. "We got some good looks, which was good. We were content with it."

Red Bulls defender Ronald Zubar came into the match off the bench and was sent off in the first fifteen minutes of the second half. Marsch said he was "disappointed" with Zubar's decision to come on for the final 30 minutes of the match.

Zubar was shown a straight red card and will now miss the next two games. "He didn't deserve to come on," Marsch said. "He didn't deserve to come on. We'll speak to the league about it, but at that point I thought it was time for him to go."

Trivia Edit<|endoftext|>Amid a barrage of criticism over his response to the Orlando, Florida, nightclub attack, Donald Trump on Monday insisted he wasn't talking about Muslims.

"I was referring to radical Islamic terrorism," Trump said during a campaign rally in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. "I was talking about the radical Islamic terrorism."

Trump was widely criticized last week for his call to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. The Republican presidential candidate later backtracked and said he was in fact talking about all terror attacks ― saying he would call it out regardless of religion.

"I was talking about the radical Islamic terrorism," Trump insisted on Monday. "I was not talking about, you know, the religion. I was not talking about the religion. The religion is a very important thing, but you know what, when I say the religion, I'm talking about the radical Islamic terrorism. I was not talking about the religion."

It's not the first time Trump has tried to explain his comments.

Last week, Trump said he was "proud" to be referred to as "the Donald" by the New York Times.

"I am very proud of myself," he told CNN's Jake Tapper. "I am very proud of my name."

That interview also came about a week after Trump was pressed further on his comments about banning Muslims from the country.

"You know, there is something called the unwritten rule of speaking softly and carrying a big stick," Trump told reporters in Iowa last week. "And I'm always proud of that. I'm very proud of my name."

Trump also mentioned the unwritten rule when he was asked about the Orlando shooting on Monday.<|endoftext|>The following is a list of items that make good gifts for Chanel, who likes Official, red items and dislikes Cute/Fancy items.

Lee Kuan Yew's eldest son, Tony, has made a name for himself in the business world.

He is one of the country's most successful young property developers and has built several high-rise buildings that have been sold out or are coming on stream.

He has also made much of his money by investing in Singaporean real estate, buying a private island and new properties in the capital, as well as a beachfront property in Bali.

His wealth, though, has not been limited to property and property development. Mr Lee's eldest son also owns an investment company, Tampines Property Partners, and has also invested in a number of Singapore-based businesses.

Mr Lee's son, Tony, has been the face of Singapore's property boom and has made a name for himself in the business world.

He is one of the country's most successful young property developers and has built several high rise buildings that have been sold out or are coming on stream.

But his wealth, though, has not been limited to property and property development.

Mr Lee's eldest son has also made much of his money by investing in Singaporean real estate, buying a private island and new properties in the capital, as well as a beachfront property in Bali.

His father's legacy

Tony, who is a senior executive at Singapore's biggest property developer, Sime Darby, has been appointed the company's chief executive for the next five years.

From the beginning of 2015, Mr Lee's son has been a key figure in the company's recent success.

In May 2015, Tony Lee was named the chairman of the board of directors for Sime Darby.

The company's shares were valued at just S$2.2 billion in 2015.

But Tony has a lot of business ahead of him.

He is the CEO of a Singapore-listed company with assets of about S$2.2 billion, the Singapore Exchange reported.

Sime Darby has become one of the hottest property developers in the country.

In a recent interview with Apple Daily, Tony Lee said he has spent 20 years in the business, as a real estate developer, and the son of the chairman of the board of directors.

"I've had to make a lot of sacrifices to make real estate work in Singapore," he said.

He said that when he was younger, he would walk out of his father's Singapore house after work and go home to his parents' home.

"I was never able to do things like that until I was 40 years old," Tony Lee said.

"I've worked hard and made good money. I've done well because of Singaporeans' hard work."

He said his father was not of a "low profile" as his younger brothers and sisters were.

"He was kind and gentle. He was a good father but he had his own agenda," Tony Lee said.

'I'm proud'

Tony Lee's father was a successful politician and architect of the nation's first direct election of MPs and ministers.

In its early days, Singapore was a British colony, and the country's parliament was not elected by popular vote.

But in 1959, the country's first direct election of MPs and ministers was introduced.

Mr Lee said he is proud of his father's legacy.

"He had a vision that he wanted to make Singapore better. He wanted to make Singapore a better place. He sacrificed so he could make Singapore better. So I'm proud of my dad," Tony Lee said.

"I hope that I will be as good as my dad."

He said he did not know what his father would think of his current career.

"I don't know if my dad would like me for what I do now. But I do know that Singaporeans are very proud of my father."<|endoftext|>Image caption The NHS in England is being stretched to the limit

The number of hospital beds in England has risen by 4,300 to 1,499, the NHS said, as it warned that the system is under threat.

The number of beds across the country has risen by 1,300 in the past year and by 120 in the past three months, the NHS said.

The health service said the rise and subsequent fall in bed numbers were so large it was impossible to keep up with demand.

At the time of writing this article, it doesn't look like the Bills will have a new head coach in place this offseason.

But even if they do, it still isn't a sure thing.

The Bills have a decision to make on Karl Dorrell, who would be their head coach if they hired one, according to Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports.

La Canfora said he spoke to a "high-level" source who said that Dorrell was not a sure thing to land the Bills' job.

"I was told that the Bills would have a head-coach opening, but it's not a done deal," La Canfora wrote.

The Bills are expected to be in the market for a new head coach after firing Rex Ryan on Sunday.

Dorrell, who played in the NFL for 12 seasons, was a defensive coordinator for the Ravens last year. He was the Ravens' defensive coordinator for the first three seasons of his career.

He was the coach of the Ravens' defensive line during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. He also coached the Ravens' linebackers from 2008 to 2010.

Dorrell wasn't on the Bills' list of candidates when Ryan was fired, according to The Buffalo News.

The Bills hired former Buccaneers and Giants coach Greg Schiano as their new head coach on Friday.

Only two other candidates remain: former Bills offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett and Cleveland Browns offensive line coach Tony Sparano.<|endoftext|>Background

Since the first version of this article, the number of videos (videos < 10 seconds) of non-observable objects has increased dramatically. It is a fact that the data collected from camera systems is far from perfect.

In general, this would not bother anyone who is in the business of building software, as there are many ways to improve the quality. However, this article is about the more fundamental problem: how to deal with these videos.

For those who prefer not to read:

For those who prefer to read:

If you are a professional in the field of data science a) this article has not been written for you and b) you should probably hire someone else to write articles for you. Otherwise, this article is for you.

I will assume you already know some basic data structures and basic algorithms. I will not teach you how to use them; rather, I will show you how to use them to deal with video.

The Basics

I will begin by defining the space that we are working in. The space is defined by the following object types:

I will use a base class of video (also called a videoObject ):

type VideoObject = {

fileName : string

}

class VideoObject ( object ):

fileName = None

The fileName property is a string which is the name of the video file in the format of "filename.mp4."

The first thing we need to do is to try to open the video file with the given name. This is done by calling the open() method of the VideoObject class:

class VideoObject ( object ):

fileName = None

def open ( self , filename ):

if not filename :

return

try :

os.system(filename)

except OSError :

pass

video = VideoObject.open(filename)

if video is not None :

return video

return None

The first argument to os.system() is the name of the file. The second argument is a list of filters which will be applied to the video. The third argument is a callback function which will be executed when the file is opened.

The args argument of os.system() can be used to pass arguments to the callback function.

For example, imagine we have a module named VideoVideo that contains both a video and a videoObject :

class VideoVideo ( object ):

fileName = None

def open ( self , filename , args = ():):

if not filename :

return

if args is not None :

video = VideoVideo.open(filename)

video.open(args)

return video

The first argument to os.system() is the name of the file. The second argument is a list of filters which will be applied to the video. The third argument is a callback function which will be executed when the file is opened.

The args argument of os.system() can be used to pass arguments to the callback function.

For example, imagine we have a module named VideoVideo that contains both a video and a videoObject :

class VideoVideo ( object ):

fileName = None

def open ( self , filename , args = ():):

if not filename

Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who was confirmed by the Senate to the post in 2006, has been a key figure in Obama's war on terrorism since the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington and in the debate over the war in Afghanistan.

Obama said he has asked Hagel to serve as defense secretary "as long as I'm president."

"We are grateful to Senator Hagel for his many years of distinguished service to our nation, and we are confident he would be an outstanding secretary of defense," the White House said.

The announcement comes as Obama is seeking to ramp up efforts to draw down U.S. troops in Afghanistan to 9,800 by the end of 2016 and to withdraw all U.S. forces by the end of 2016.

Obama said he spoke by phone with Obama on Monday and "agreed that the time is right to nominate Chuck Hagel to serve as secretary of defense."

Obama has also nominated two other candidates for the defense secretary post: former U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo for CIA director and former U.S. Senator Dan Coats for NSA director.

The White House said Obama will also nominate former U.S. Representative Jim Talent for the Central Intelligence Agency.

The nomination process for the other two positions will begin on Tuesday, the White House said.

Hagel, a two-time Republican presidential candidate, is a warrior-admiring, Vietnam veteran who rose to the rank of lieutenant general and rose through the ranks, both as a senator and as CIA director.

He is known for his hawkish views on Iran, Israel and Iran's nuclear program, which the United States believes is aimed at developing nuclear weapons.

In a way I agree. I guess my question is who would have the body to wear the 'power' of the god. I.e. the body would have to be like a god.


I think most people I've talked to would say that they could use the power of the god. It's just how their god would be so I don't believe that it would be a power that someone could just tap into.


I think the only way the god could be defeated would be by wearing the body of the god or if the god were to die. The god could be cut in two, one half having the power of the god, but being a part of the god, while the other half would be a pure body.


It's just a theory I guess.<|endoftext|>A move by the City of Austin to delay the construction of a new Lone Star Transcontinental Terminal is being challenged in court by a business group and a local newspaper, with the business group claiming the move is an attack on its ability to do business.

The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas on Friday granted a motion by the Austin Chamber of Commerce to intervene in the case.

The Chamber of Commerce is a corporate trade group that represents nearly 1,000 businesses.

The group says the Texas Railroad Commission has postponed the decision on whether to issue a permit for Lone Star Transcontinental Terminal LLC — the Texas company that wants to build the new terminal — by delaying a public hearing.

The Chamber says the delay is an attempt to hit the company with more than $250,000 in fines, no longer be allowed to participate in the state's tax incentives program and impede its ability to start construction by conducting a separate environmental review.

The Chamber says the delay is also an attack on the business community's ability to conduct business.

"This is an effort by the Texas Railroad Commission to make it impossible for Lone Star Transcontinental Terminal to move forward and keep our jobs here in our city," said Greg Marx, the Chamber's vice president of government affairs and public affairs.

The company's petition to delay the environmental review was filed with the Texas Railroad Commission in December for a permit to continue construction of the terminal at the site of the current terminal on the north side of Interstate 35. The petition was amended to include a request for a delay in the public notice period.

The permit for the new terminal is a key issue because it will allow the company to use a major highway for its freight and passengers.

The Texas Railroad Commission said in its denial letter to the company that the delay in the environmental review "is necessary to allow Lone Star Transcontinental Terminal LLC to register its property in Texas and complete construction of the new terminal."

The Chamber of Commerce says that it believes the delay is actually an attempt to delay the permit rather than a true attempt to delay the environmental review.

"It is a unilateral action by the Texas Railroad Commission that harms a large number of Texas businesses," Marx said.

The Texas Department of Transportation, the Texas Department of State Health Services and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality are also parties to the lawsuit.<|endoftext|>Tom Cruise has been making headlines since September with his lackluster performances in three films that together have grossed a paltry $180 million worldwide.

One of those films was Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, the third installment in the series. The movie actually performed better overseas than it did in the United States, grossing $186 million worldwide for a $275 million domestic box office take.

The disappointing performance led to Cruise reportedly being replaced as the lead in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation. The movie was released in late October and ranked No. 42 on the list of the top-grossing movies of 2014.

"It's a tough day," Cruise's publicist, Ken Kamins, told Deadline. "Tom is a tremendous performer and his performance in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation was spectacular. We wish him all the best with the films he has in the works."

Cruise has not re-titled the film or given any indication that he might return to the franchise.

While Cruise is a blockbuster star, he has failed to deliver a box office hit since the release of Mission: Impossible 3 in 2006. In addition to the recent news that Cruise's most recent wife, Katie Holmes, is pregnant with their second child, the actor has been in the news for a number of controversial incidents over the past few years.

There is no doubt that I am a man who loves to work, but I also love to play games. I love to watch sports, I love to play video games, and I even love to read books. I have spent my entire life trying to figure out what I love most, and my answers have never been satisfying. I started that quest in my teens and into my twenties, and I've been searching ever since.

So it's with great excitement that I am writing this article, because I've decided to stop searching. I have decided that I love video games. I know this because, the past few months, I have discovered a treasure trove of games that I cannot wait to play. I've discovered games that I know I'll love, and games that I'm absolutely sure I'll love.

And they are all video games that are coming out this year, and I want to tell you about them.

The games I am talking about are all coming out this year and they are all amazing. If you've been living under a rock, you should know that I love a good game. And I love a good RPG. And I love a good strategy game. And I love a good shooter. And I love a good action/adventure game. And I love a good puzzle game. And I love all of those video games.

And I know that I am one of those people that loves all of those things. I'm not just saying that because I have a massive collection of video games. I have a massive collection of all kinds of video games.

I want you to be aware that, whether you are a new gamer, a seasoned gamer, or a fan of video games, you will find something new to love this year.

We've already collected a few of these games and you can find them all on our All Access page. You can also find out about the other new games coming out from the makers of Minecraft, Call of Duty, and Minecraft: Story Mode.

If you think that I'm being a little too positive about all of these games, you are absolutely right. They are fantastic. I've been to nearly all of these video games and they are all absolutely amazing.

If you're a veteran gamer, I'm still not sure if you can get over The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I mean, I'm firmly in the "I loved Skyrim and I love it" camp. I have a few issues with it, but I still love Skyrim.

If you're a fan of the Dragon Age series, then you'll love everything that Bioware has been working on. Dragon Age: Inquisition is the first entry in this series, and it is the best game in the series. This game is so good that I'm already working on a new game in the Dragon Age series after I finish this.

If you're a fan of Tekken, you will love Tekken 7. This game is just phenomenal. It's my favorite fighting game of all time. I've played this game for hours, and I still can't believe that I have time to play it.

If you've been a fan of Minecraft, you'll love Minecraft: Story Mode. This game is not a Minecraft game, but it is a really good Minecraft game. It's the best Minecraft story that I've ever seen. It's a real treat to watch. It's an adventure that is unlike anything we've seen before.

If you're a fan of Call of Duty, you'll love Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. This game is going to blow your mind. I'm excited to play this game. It's going to be an amazing experience.

If you're a fan of Minecraft: Story Mode, then you'll love the other two episodes. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare will be released in theaters next year. At the same time, Minecraft is coming to Netflix and they will release the episode called "The Last of Us Part II" in theaters before the movie is released.

These are just a few of the games that are coming out this year and I'm excited to play them all. I'm also excited to see where they take these games, and I will be there with you as they do.

What are you waiting for? Go out and buy all of these games today.

The revelations are contained in thousands of emails hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's account, which were released by Wikileaks on Friday.

Among the emails are messages from the account of Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, with which the campaign's top official had a private conversation about the Republican nominee's vice presidential pick.

The Xbox One is a very capable console, and it handles games much better than it did in the days of the Xbox 360. The system has a ton of power, but it's not perfect.

I'm a little sad to report that the Xbox One's lack of backward compatibility is an issue for me as well.

Backwards compatibility is a wonderful feature for any console. It allows you to play your old games on your new console, and it is a great way to make sure you never have to buy a new console again.

If Microsoft allowed you to use the Xbox One's backward compatibility features, however, all of your old games would no longer work on the Xbox One. That would make it hard for you to play your favorite games on the Xbox One, and it would make it really difficult to upgrade your old console to the Xbox One.

When Microsoft announced that it would no longer be honoring backwards compatibility for the Xbox One, I was a little worried. The Xbox One is a pretty capable console, and it handles games much better than it did in the days of the Xbox 360. The system has a ton of power, but it's not perfect. For example, it has a hard time keeping up with a lot of modern games, and it has a hard time keeping up with the Xbox 360's 60 frames per second.

Backwards compatibility is a great feature for any console, but the Xbox One is a bit of a beast. The system struggles with a lot of older games, and it lags behind a lot of modern games.

The Xbox One is a great machine, but it doesn't handle modern games as well as it once did. Microsoft needs to get rid of the Xbox One's backward compatibility, and it needs to do it sooner than later. I never remember choosing to play a game on my Xbox 360. I remember playing games on the Xbox One.

So, the question is: What can you do to make sure that your games will work on the Xbox One?

Update: Microsoft has now confirmed that the Xbox One will not be backward compatible with Xbox 360 games.

The Xbox One is a fantastic machine, but I have a few suggestions for how Microsoft could make it better.

If I was going to take the train, and I was going to take the train from the airport to the city, I would take the train from the airport to the city, and then take the train to the city. It's much more convenient. Coincidentally, it's also the only way to get to the city from the airport, since the train is about 15 minutes late.

But that's not what I do. I take the bus, because it's cheaper. So I'm in a bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus, and then I'm on the bus.

Greetings, fellow geeks!

I'm back, and I've got a super-sized announcement to make. After a few weeks off, I'm back. I've been in a bit of a slump, a bit of a hangover. Compared to the joy and excitement that I felt when I started out, things are a bit smothered.

It's true; I haven't published a book since my first book The Unofficial Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy began in 1994. And in the intervening years, a whole lot of the things I love about writing and publishing have changed. And like any great writer, I've had to really work to adapt to the new realities. My attitude in that time has been to focus on what makes my stories resonate with people, and adapt to whatever new realities are presented to me.

And so, I'm back in a big way. I'm announcing four new novels, and all of them are set in my own world, the world of the Periphery, a world where my stories are inspired by and reinterpretations of sci-fi and fantasy classics — classic stories that inspire my own.

The first book in the series, The Unofficial Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy, is now available. It's a volume covering everything from the history of science fiction and fantasy to the history of science fiction and fantasy writing, from the great classics to the modern talent. It's a great place to start if you're a fan of, say, the classic works of Robert Heinlein, Ray Bradbury, H.P. Lovecraft, or Arthur C. Clarke. And I've written it with the input of some of my most enthusiastic fans.

I'm also returning with a new series of short stories, The Periphery, where I'll take you on a journey through the weirdest realities, the strangest realities, where the weirdest things happen. It's a series of fantasy novels set in the Periphery, and I'll be releasing the first two stories every few months. I've been writing these for a long time, and I think they're going to be some of my best work yet.

And then, I'm also returning with a new series of novellas, The Periphery, where new stories are revealed every month. You might have heard of the series, but you might not have read it yet. It's a new series, and it'll be every month. I'll be revealing the first novella in the series each month.

And finally, I'm also returning with a new series of short stories, The Periphery, where I'll take you on a journey through the weirdest realities, the strangest realities, where the weirdest things happen. It's a series of fantasy novels set in the Periphery, and I'll be releasing the first two stories every few months. I'll be revealing the first novella in the series each month.

Yes, I'm returning to a world I love, and a world where I've been a part of for so long. To be able to return, and to be able to do what I've always wanted to do: write for a living.

I've had a great time since I came back here. I've been able to write my books, and to publish them, in a way that I couldn't when I was writing for the New York Review of Books, or writing in magazines like Strange Horizons and the New York Review of Science Fiction. Now I can write for a living, and I have the time and freedom I've always wanted.

But I'm not done yet. I have the next big thing in mind. So even though I've got a very challenging four-year project to finish, I'm going to keep working on new projects, and I'm going to keep writing.

I'm truly grateful to everyone who has supported me over the years. I have always appreciated your support, not only in the form of words of encouragement, but in the form of your encouragement in the form of your money. In fact, that's what enabled me to do what I'm doing now.

I don't know how much more I can say. But I do know that I have no idea how long I'll be able to continue this. I know that I'll be working on my projects, and I know that I'll be writing for a living. I hope you'll continue to support me, and let me know what you think about my new projects.

Thank you,

The project is to make a game out of a board game that I like and that I think some people might like. I'm currently working on it on my about page.

The game is called "Turtledove". It is a game based on the board game "Turtle Beach Turtledove".

It's official: the Canadian government is planning to promote gas-powered cars in the country by selling low-cost leases of new vehicles to Canadians.

In a recent announcement, Minister of Natural Resources Jim Carr confirmed that the government is working to sell "subsidized" new vehicles to Canadians, which are expected to be available in the coming weeks.

The program will be administered by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the auto industry, and will target a range of vehicles, including gas-powered vehicles.

Carr said the government is targeting Canadians who have "likely never even seen an electric vehicle" and are interested in purchasing a low-cost vehicle that will help them enjoy driving and reduce emissions.

"This government is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Canada and we can do this by encouraging Canadians to choose more fuel-efficient vehicles," he said.

"We know that Canadians are driving less, but we also know that they want to be good environmental stewards; we want them to drive more fuel-efficient vehicles. That's why we're introducing a program to help them do that."

The program will begin with the leasing of "subsidized" new vehicles to Canadians.

This announcement follows the government's announcement earlier this year that it would ban the sale of new gasoline vehicles in Canada by 2040.

Carr added that the new initiative is designed to make sure that the government continues to support "cleaner vehicles and cleaner transportation systems in Canada, while still providing a vehicle option for Canadians."

Canada's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has previously said that the gas-powered vehicle fleet in Canada has increased by a staggering 37% in the past four years.

This increase has been attributed to federal government incentives to encourage the purchase of plug-in vehicles.

The government has also announced that it will subsidize the purchase of electric vehicles, with EVs getting a price break of $7,500.

Carr also said that an "open and transparent procurement process" is being implemented for the upcoming car leasing program, and that the government will be seeking out the best possible leasing companies.

At his first state-level debate, Republican Donald Trump's response to a question about women's rights was to talk about how he's going to "make America great again."

When "Democrat" Tim Kaine pressed Trump on his past comments about women's roles, he replied, "Look, women are special, and I think it's a special time and a special place in our society for them to have the opportunity to make decisions about their own lives."

He added, "But I also want to say something about the incredible women of Wisconsin. Women have worked so long and so hard to get where they are. And I will tell you, Hillary and I will work very hard to make sure that women are empowered in every way possible, and that we raise the minimum wage to a living wage."

The debate was held in Wisconsin on Monday evening, and the TV networks chose to anchor the event in the state, which is important because most of the Republican presidential candidates have refused to debate there.

But Trump didn't mention Wisconsin at the debate; he made the point that he's going to "make America great again." The "great" part of that statement, we'll argue, isn't what people think it is. "Great," for Trump, means "white."

The "white" part of the statement — historically, the word has been used to refer to people who are European and Christian — is also what people think it is.

It was a nice rhetorical trick, if you think about it. By saying he's going to "make America great again," Trump effectively turned "white" into "European," and "European" into "Christian," and simply made a change in his own language.

The move is a bit like a runner using "the wind" instead of "running." He's shifting the conversation about his running from the fact that he's running to the fact that he's "making America great again."

By shifting the focus from running to making America great again, Trump is suggesting that America as a country is about to change. But the shift is only relative to white people.

"The wind" is not a reference to global warming, but to the economic policies of the Reagan administration. The wind is a reference to the economic policies of the Reagan administration. It's possible that Trump is referring to the wind when he says "make America great again." But by saying "make America great again," Trump is suggesting that America as a country is about to change — that America will be great because white people will be great.

It's not a stretch to say that Trump's rhetoric is designed to appeal to white people. His campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again," is a play on the phrase "Make America White Again." Trump is not the first presidential candidate to use the phrase. But his use of the phrase is different.

In a May interview with CNN, Trump took credit for the phrase: "I'm very good at marketing, actually," he said. "I'm very good at marketing myself as a 'winner,' and I really believe that."

"I think it's a great slogan, and I like it a lot," he added, "and it's actually working."

Trump spoke to the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013, and he told the crowd that the phrase "Us and Them" should be changed to "Us and the World."

"The world is us and the world is the United States of America," he said. "We are a country that is made up of individuals on this earth, people from every walk of life, every color, every creed, every religion. And we are so connected. We all bleed the same blood."

That last part is pretty much gutting of the appeal of the phrase "Us and the World." By saying "we all bleed the same blood," Trump is taking the concept of "Us" — which is about people of color — and using it to reinforce the idea that "the world" is about white people.

The phrase is a powerful claim for Trump's campaign. To emphasize this point, he showed up at a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday with a large sign that read, "The World is White."

"I'm going to make America great again, because we're not going to be made great anymore," he said. "And we're going to start winning again, winning like never before."

Trump is making the claim that America is a white nation where people want to join. The fact is that America is a nation of immigrants, and that people of color have been in America the longest, and that they have been the most successful, and that they have been the most oppressed.

The Bucs have plenty of draft picks and future contracts to spend but they have pretty much all of the right pieces in place to win now.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have a stellar record in recent years and his general manager, Jason Licht, gets a ton of credit for that.

The Bucs are on the upswing now that Licht has put together a handful of solid drafts and his future deals look to be a big reason why.

It's a hell of a staff at his disposal, so the Bucs are well positioned to move forward as a franchise.

But there is no reason to panic.

First, the Bucs don't have to fix what isn't broke. They have a solid core of players that are good enough to win now.

Now let's look at some of the key areas for improvement.

Running back: The Bucs signed Doug Martin to a three-year, $15 million contract last offseason despite him having ACL and knee injuries in the past.

Martin is a fantastic player. But the Bucs needed to get him involved in the passing game to get him to top-end speed. That's not going to happen with Vincent Jackson.

The team needs to draft a running back early in the draft to help complement Martin. Jameis Winston has some good options in the first round in Todd Gurley or Melvin Gordon. If the team does nothing with the pick, it could be the pick that gives them a solid, young running back.

Tampa Bay's defense: Licht has done a solid job with the defense in Tampa Bay. The Bucs rank second in the NFL in points allowed and lead the NFL in scoring defense.

But Licht has the Bucs' defense overpaid. The Bucs have spent heavily on the defensive line, with the likes of Gerald McCoy and Lavonte David.

The defense has been very good, but there are holes to fill and upgrades to make. The team has a lot of draft picks to spend, including a first-round pick. Tampa Bay should look to address some of the holes on this defense early in the draft.

Darrelle Revis: This is the most common question on this list. Revis is one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL and it's hard to imagine the Bucs letting him go.

Licht wants to bring Revis back, but it's not a simple decision. The Bucs need to find a way to make Revis happy and he has been very demanding about that.

The team has the third-highest cap number in the NFL at $84 million. And as the franchise tag for Revis comes down to $12.5 million, the Bucs will have to find a way to pay him to stay.

The Bucs can use the franchise tag on Revis and have money to spend elsewhere. But the move would be a massive blow to Licht and to the entire franchise.

It's a tough decision for Licht, but he needs to make it.<|endoftext|>To the Editor:

Re "The Case for Raiding Wounded Afghan Civilians" (news article, Feb. 9):

The Taliban have been responsible for hundreds of unlawful attacks on civilians during the past five years.

In a recent column, for instance, we compared a November 2010 attack on the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul with the Oct. 23, 2001, attack on the U.S.S. Cole. The Cole attack on the USS Cole occurred in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when the United States was engaged in a military campaign in Afghanistan.

But the Taliban were launching a campaign of indiscriminate violence against civilians long before the Cole attacks. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul recorded more than 98 such attacks between December 2004 and August 2007.

The number of civilian casualties in those attacks has been estimated at more than 30 civilian deaths and over 4,000 civilian injuries.

Many of these attacks occurred under the Taliban regime, when the Taliban's leaders would order their fighters to target civilians. The Taliban's leadership was not responsible for the conduct of these attacks, but it did condone and direct them.

The Taliban leadership has since been responsible for a large number of such attacks, and the Taliban's leaders must be held accountable for the conduct of these attacks.<|endoftext|>The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has issued a report regarding the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Espionage Act (Espionage Act) investigation into former CIA Director, David Petraeus. The OIG report found no evidence that OPM's investigation was improper or otherwise unlawful. This report is based on the OIG's review of the materials provided by OPM to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC).

The virus is believed to be "very similar" in structure to the previously known Ebola virus strain, said the senior WHO official, with the difference that it is not yet known how the virus behaves in its new human host.

The current outbreak is the worst since the virus was discovered in 1976.

"We are in the middle of the epidemic. We have been very careful to avoid any speculation about what's happening," Dr. David Nabarro, WHO assistant director-general, said in an interview. "We don't know how it is spreading, how it is being transmitted. We can't say that it's not happening."

But he said there are some "very interesting similarities" in some of the Ebola viruses that have spread to humans, including the fact that they both have a rhabdovirus genome.

Mr. Nabarro said there is a good chance the virus is even more dangerous than the Ebola virus that has killed thousands of people in West Africa.

The current outbreak is the worst since the virus was discovered in 1976.

"We're not talking about a stage one of an epidemic," Dr. Nabarro said, referring to the type of outbreak where no one has died.

"We are talking about an epidemic that is now in its third year. We are talking about thousands of people being infected with a disease that is highly infectious, highly transmissible, and that has caused a lot of death in its past outbreaks. And we're talking about a disease that has had a very profound impact on the health care system," he said.

The virus is thought to have begun in the forests of Guinea and Sierra Leone, and has since spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone.

There is no vaccine to prevent Ebola, which kills up to 90 percent of those it infects. When symptoms develop, they can include fever, headaches, muscle and joint pain, vomiting and diarrhea.

In Guinea, where the outbreak is most severe, some hospitals are already rationing certain drugs, while health workers say they are now too weak to do their jobs properly.

"We have to stop [medics] from treating patients as they come in," said Dr. Sébastien Léger, a medic at the Médecins Sans Frontières hospital in Conakry, Guinea's capital. "We are trying to limit the number of people we can treat," he said, adding that the staff was also being warned not to treat the youngest patients.

"It's not good to treat children," Dr. Léger said. "If they even get a small infection, it can spread to other children. They might pass it on to their mother, and then it can spread."

New laws have been passed in Guinea that require family members to stay at least 30 meters away from patients.

In Sierra Leone, where there are no quarantine laws, health workers are afraid to treat patients, the head of the Ebola treatment center in Freetown said on Tuesday.

"There are too many cases," said Dr. Antonio Conteh, head of the Freetown Ebola treatment center. "We are now afraid to treat people."

But Dr. Nabarro said that in Liberia, where the Ebola outbreak is the most severe, it is unclear whether the virus has spread beyond the capital, Monrovia.

"At the moment, we don't know how the virus is spreading," he said. "We can't say that it's not happening."

He said that while it is possible that the virus has reached Guinea, the outbreak could also have spread to Sierra Leone.

Dr. Nabarro said the outbreak could last months or even years.

"We don't know how long it is going to last," he said. "We are talking about an epidemic that is quite serious and that has been spreading over several years."

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization issued a travel alert on Tuesday for all health care workers who had been in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, and those in the United States, asking them to monitor their health.

"The risk of Ebola virus disease is very high," Dr. Nabarro said.

It is not yet known whether the Ebola virus outbreak is linked to the recent admission of an American aid worker, Dr. Kent Brantly, from Liberia to the Nebraska Medical Center, and the death of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first diagnosed American Ebola victim.

The World Health Organization has urged healthcare workers to avoid contact with patients with Ebola unless absolutely necessary to save their life, regardless of where they are in West Africa.

"The risk of Ebola virus disease is very high," said Dr. Nabarro, who said the virus is not airborne.

"The virus is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, including blood, saliva, urine, faeces, vomit, breast milk, semen, and breast milk of infected women

Rieko Tsukasa (駒岡 大輝, Tsukasa Rieko) is a second-year student at Gekkoukan High School and the former captain of the volleyball club. She has a unique personality that blends a shy and polite attitude with a perverted and hot-blooded mentality. The two traits are often mixed throughout the series, as Rieko is often in a situation that requires a more perverted demeanor, but she is technically polite, and in many cases acts as a gentleman towards others.

Contents show]

Appearance Edit

Rieko is a young girl with long, light-colored hair and pale white skin. She has bangs that reach her eyes, and usually wears a light pink shirt and a light blue skirt with a pattern on the bottom. She usually wears a short sleeved light pink top.

At the very beginning of the series, Rieko is shown to be a very pretty girl. She has long, light brown hair and a sharp face that is usually hidden by her bangs, a pair of round eyes and a cute smile. She is also often shown to be very intelligent, as she is a member of the volleyball club and has a knack for reading.

As the series progresses, however, Rieko becomes quite arrogant and cold-hearted. She is known for her cold, calculated, and efficient behavior, often using cold and calculating actions for her own gain. She is also very violent, and is willing to use violence in order to achieve her goals. When she is in a heated situation, Rieko is usually extremely cold and indifferent to the other team members, preferring to stay out of the fray as if she is a fish out of water.

In her early appearances, Rieko wears a long-sleeved white shirt with a light blue skirt and matching shoes.

Personality Edit

Rieko, at first, seems to be very polite and hot-blooded, but she shows a somewhat perverted side at some points. This side of her personality is shown when she is found naked on the floor of the pool where the club is practicing, and she is shown to be perverted as well when she asks Kōgo to take off his clothes and go on a date with her and the others.

She is also somewhat shy, as seen when she is caught being loud and inattentive by the other team members during practice. She is also rather academic, as seen during her first year of high school, where she is often seen studying and writing essays.

Rieko is also very intelligent, as shown when she is able to read the newspaper and understand the meaning behind the story written by Yoshikage Kira. She knows how to use a computer, which she uses to store information on her phone, such as her kendo club's records and books, two of which she uses for her experiments. She is also very perceptive, given that she seems to be able to read the thoughts of others and make deductions from them.

While she is very intelligent, Rieko is also very honest and can be rather blunt in her thoughts, as shown when she tells Kōgo to stop being so bad. Her honesty is also shown when she tells Kōgo, who was very rude to her earlier, to apologize to her.

Despite her tendency to be blunt, she is in fact very caring and gentle, as seen when she expresses her sorrow when her family is broken up by Kōgo. She is also very understanding, as shown when she helps Kōgo understand how Sōma is doing after he loses his memories.

Rieko's personality is also shown when she is in a bad mood, as shown when she loses her temper with Yūta Hamada, when she tries to fight with him and when she asks Kōgo to help her move the bar.

Background Edit

Rieko's family was very poor and she was raised as a housewife and had to work as a maid, resulting in her becoming a very quiet and ordinary person. However, she had a small taste of life when she met Sōma Yukihira, a boy from her town who gave her the courage to start her own business. She was extremely grateful towards him and was the first person to accept Sōma's offer to join Kōkō Raikōin.

The best way to describe the new film "The New World" is to say that it's a cool, modern take on "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" with a few twists. If you've seen the original film, you'll recognize some of the actors, but you'll also feel very differently about them.

"The New World" stars Jeff Goldblum as the titular character, who is nearly a child himself. He lives with his mother (Milka Volkova) and his father (Giovanni Ribisi), who runs a colonial-era pharmaceutical company. The film is set in the 1890s in a fictionalized version of the United States.

READ MORE: Sundance Review: 'The New World' Is a Great, Cool Take on 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'

The movie plays out like a TV series, and it's a surprisingly fun one. Goldblum has a lot of fun playing the various characters, including a man named Louis (Sebastian Stan) who is obsessed with the hero of the original movie, the hunchback.

For the most part, the movie has the same kind of cheesy, slapstick feel as the original movie. But there are some big changes, and a lot of them are appropriate for the modern age.

For example, the film is set in a fictionalized version of the United States, but it moves very easily between time periods and historical periods. This is because the movie was largely made at the same time it was shot, until the change in history.

The film has a few twists, such as one in which the movie's hero is also a hunchback. Jeff Goldblum plays a man named Louis who is obsessed with the hunchback, and he is one of the main characters in the new movie. (Photo: Paul Drinkwater, AP)

The film has a few twists, such as one in which the hunchback is also a hero. The film doesn't pull any punches. Goldblum plays Louis, a man who takes after his hero in his appearance and personality. He has a passion for the hunchback and his story is ultimately about his love for the character.

Goldblum's Louis is the kind of character who you might see in a modern version of "Star Wars." He's always smiling, and he seems to always be in the right place at the right time. Most of the film is set in a fictionalized version of the United States, and Goldblum has a lot of fun playing the various characters, such as a man named Louis (Sebastian Stan) who is obsessed with the hero of the original movie, the hunchback.

In addition to Goldblum's Louis, the film has Jeff Bridges as a man named Edward, who is someone who loves the hunchback and has a lot of trouble understanding his love for the character. Bridges plays the man who decides to take matters into his own hands, and it's a very cool story.

The New World also stars Milka Volkova as the hunchback's mother, and it's nice to see her again, but she's not a major part of the plot or the movie. The film has a very cool look and it's set in a fictionalized version of the United States. (Photo: Paul Drinkwater, AP)

The New World also has a cool look, which is fitting for the film. It's set in a fictionalized version of the United States, but it's set in a place that looks like a modern town, which is interesting because it's very different from the original film.

"The New World" is not a perfect movie, but it is a fun one, and it is definitely worth watching. It's a good movie that doesn't shy away from some of the darker moments of the original movie. It's not going to win any awards, but it has a fun story and a lot of great performances.

"The New World" will be available on VOD on Nov. 17.

When something is wrong, it's often difficult to know where to begin. That's why we've compiled a list of some of the best and most important questions you should be asking when it comes to a loved one who is struggling with any aspect of their mental health.

How important is the diagnosis?

"When you have someone who has been diagnosed with a mental illness, it's important to understand that it is a diagnosis that's still up for debate. Many people with mental illness struggle with negative thoughts despite being diagnosed with a mental health problem. Don't assume that because someone has been diagnosed with a mental illness that they are fully responsible for what they experience. It's important to understand that this can make it harder for people to get help." —Anna, 24

What does the diagnosis mean?

"It's important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all diagnosis. There are many different conditions that can cause symptoms that may or may not be related to a mental illness. If someone is struggling with a particular pattern of symptoms, it may or may not be related to a mental illness. It's important to know that not everyone who is diagnosed with a mental illness will experience symptoms that are similar to the symptoms someone with a mental illness would experience. It's important to recognize that everyone's experience is different." —Caitlin, 23

How are they treating the symptoms?

"It's important to know that the symptoms are not the only signs of a mental health issue. They can be caused by a number of different factors, and it's important to know how they are being treated. If someone is receiving treatment for other disorders, it may be difficult for them to tolerate certain treatments or medications. It's important to know how they are being treated and to continue to ask about treatment as needed. It's also important to know what their treatment plan is and how to follow it." —Kaitlin, 28

Are there treatments that are effective?

"It's important to know that there are treatments that are effective. Asking about the types of treatments someone is receiving and what the timeline for their completion is can be incredibly important. It's important to know how they're feeling and what they're experiencing so that you can be prepared for the response. It's important to know the difference between cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and speech therapy (ST). It's also important to know if they've been diagnosed with a mood disorder, anxiety disorder, substance abuse, or any other type of mental illness. Because there can be so many different diagnoses, it's important to know what to expect. What your loved one is experiencing is not always the same as someone who isn't experiencing the symptoms they are. It's important to know that there are options available for your loved one." —Aly, 30

How long does it take?

"There are a variety of treatment plans that a person may choose. The length of time it takes varies greatly. Some people may have a long time to go before they feel better, while others may be able to start feeling better within the first few weeks. It's important to know how long their symptoms have been going on, and to ask about the plan for when they are hopefully feeling better." —Anna, 24

What mental health conditions do they have?

"It's important to be aware of any mental health conditions a loved one may have. It's important to know if they have anxiety and any other mental health conditions, such as depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. It's also important to know if they are dealing with bipolar disorder, and if they are taking medications. It's important to know if they are using alcohol, and if they're using a substance that may impair their judgment or ability to think clearly." —Caitlin, 23

When is it a good idea to call the police?

"It's important to know that calling the police can result in an arrest, even if the person is not physically harming themselves. It's important to know what to do in a situation where you need to call the police. For instance, if they are having a psychotic episode, you may need to call the police as soon as possible after you think your loved one is in danger. It's important to know whether you should call the police for their own protection or for someone else's safety. It's also important to know what the police officer's training is about dealing with mental illness. It's important to know what questions to ask, what the officer's response should be, and how you should go over your questions and concerns with your loved one." —Kaitlin, 28

Is there a path to recovery or is it all hopeless?

"It's important to know that there is a path to recovery. The best thing is to learn how to recognize that there is always hope. Recovery is not about staying on the path, but making

Barbara is a passionate writer and animal lover who has been professionally blogging for over 10 years and counting.

When a veterinarian diagnosed a 6-year-old boy with leukemia in July, he didn't know what to expect.

Pumps, intravenous drugs and radiation weren't the only options.

The boy's parents, who live in a small town in Pennsylvania, were told that he had six months to live.

"I was told he had an 80-percent chance of survival," Chris, the boy's father, told The Huffington Post. "And that was just the first thing the vet said."

Chris was shocked by the news that his son had leukemia. He had feared it was a sign of something worse.

"I was so heartbroken," he said. "I had no idea that the disease could be so serious. It is a very difficult thing to deal with when your son is sick."

He took his son to a local hospital in a small town in the Middle East, where he was put in a room reserved for children with terminal illnesses.

The hospital informed Chris that his son wasn't expected to live unless his blood count dropped and his immune system protected him from infections.

Chris was told his son's chances of survival were around 20 percent.

"It took three years to get him from the first diagnosis down to the current stage," he said.

With no other options available to him, Chris and his wife, Kim, decided to travel to the United States for the treatment that could save his son's life.

Chris and Kim applied for a special visa through the American Embassy in Saudi Arabia.

"We applied for a visa with the embassy in Riyadh and they sent us a note requesting we fill out an application, so they could inspect our medical records," Chris said. "The only problem was that we were in the Middle East. We had no records at home."

Chris and his wife traveled to the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where they were interviewed by an embassy official.

"They said they needed to see our records, but they couldn't accept the paperwork. They said we were not in the U.S. legally, so they couldn't accept our documents," Chris said.

"The officer told me that I needed to leave the country right away, and I said, 'I'm from the Middle East, we don't have visas.'"

The couple's application was denied.

"They said that we didn't have a valid visa, which was a lie," Kim said. "The officer just said, 'They won't let you in.'"

The couple's story shows how difficult it can be for foreigners to travel to the U.S., especially those who may have been born outside the country.

The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh has since issued a statement saying that refugees like Chris and Kim are not allowed to enter the country.

A spokesman for the American Embassy in Riyadh told HuffPost that, "The United States has made clear that it will neither admit those who wish to harm our citizens, nor will we admit those who attempt to exploit the United States for nefarious purposes."

The embassy added: "All individuals seeking admission to the United States as refugees undergo a rigorous vetting process that includes an in-person interview, a security check, a criminal record check, an e-verify check and an identity check. The U.S. government does not comment on individual cases."

The Boy with Leukemia

Chris said he and his wife spent a year in the U.S. trying to get a visa to enter Saudi Arabia.

"We applied every single time," he said. "We applied for normal visitor visas, normal work visas, as well as student visas. We submitted our application in person at the embassy in Riyadh. The process is very, very long."

In the meantime, Chris and his wife were forced to live in their car for four months while they waited for the visa to be approved.

"I'm a human being," Chris said. "I worked hard, I did my best, but I wasn't able to get the visa. I had to go through the process and it was so long. I had to go through four months of waiting in my car."

The couple was finally able to get their visa approved in late August.

"We arrived in the U.S. in the middle of September," Chris said. "We are doing okay now. We are working hard. We are trying to get our life back. We are still very in debt, but we are trying to get back on our feet."

On Oct. 1, Chris traveled to a clinic in Pennsylvania to get the blood work that he needs to be certain he gets the right blood transfusions.

"I have to follow what the doctor says

The World's Smallest Underwater Robot

I'm not a fan of underwater robots. I don't think my kids should be forced to spend time in a submersible, and I don't think I'd want to see a robot exploring the murky depths of the ocean. But a new project from MIT really gets the idea of underwater robots just right.

The project, which was designed by Professor Thomas Salvi of MIT's Media Lab, was started with the goal of creating a "submarine robot that is completely autonomous and is completely safe." The team was able to achieve this goal by using a computer chip that was 1/20th the size of the brains inside of the tiny robot.

"Somewhere in the next decade or so, we're going to have robots that are 1/10th the size of the brain in their brains," Salvi said in a statement. "And they'll have the same kind of capacities."

The new robot, called the DeepMind DeepSub, is based on the DeepMind DeepMindBot, a DeepMind research system that has been on display at the London Science Museum. The team took the DeepMind DeepMindBot and shrunk it down by a factor of 20,000 to 25,000 times.

The reason the DeepMind DeepSub is small is because it uses a computational algorithm to sense the world around it. It's able to detect its environment using a combination of a camera, sonar, and GPS. The DeepSub has a camera on the front that can see everything in front of it, and a sonar on the back that can detect whatever it can. The robot can also sense things using an automated sonar system, and also uses the same kind of onboard computer that is used to program the DeepMind DeepMindBot.

The DeepSub has a camera on the front that can see everything in front of it, and a sonar on the back that can detect whatever it can.

To get the robot to move, the DeepSub's controller learns how to move the robot in a way that is safe for its control system. By using what's known as "deep learning," the control system is able to make sure it's moving in the best way possible.

In addition to the DeepSub, Salvi's team is also working on a smaller version of the DeepMind DeepMindBot that will be able to swim.

"Somewhere in the next decade or so, we're going to have robots that are 1/10th the size of the brain in their brains."

The idea of building tiny robots is not new, of course. There are also miniature robots that can scan the environment. In 2014, the team behind the Mini-Robot Microscope made a robotic robot that was able to detect and clean up hazardous waste from the environment. The team also made a small robotic vehicle that can help people with disabilities.

The MIT team is not the only one working on underwater robots. Another research team, known as the Robo-Tricyclops, is also working on underwater robots.<|endoftext|>"The Rich Get Richer, and We Get Wiped Out"

Which is the more effective way to address rising inequality: raising taxes on the rich or cutting social programs?

The answer is no one knows.

The Obama administration has been using the "fiscal cliff," when the Bush tax cuts expire, as an opportunity to push a set of proposals that would require deep cuts to the social safety net. The offer of the most significant tax increases in history has been used by some to argue for cuts to certain social programs.

But that's not an argument that's going to gain traction.

Contrary to popular belief, the rich aren't getting richer in the United States. In fact, the top 1 percent of earners made 25 percent more from 2009 to 2010 than they did in 2007. The income of the top 0.1 percent has gone up by 45 percent, while the incomes of the bottom 99 percent have fallen.

Although a few middle-class households have seen their incomes rise somewhat, they're not doing so because of the economic recovery. In fact, in 2011, the median income of families with children was lower than it was in 2007.

So the question isn't whether the income of the rich has risen, but how much of that rise is due to government policies and how much is due to the solid economy.

The Obama administration's proposal, if enacted, would significantly reduce taxes on the wealthy, while raising them on middle-income households. As a result, it would raise taxes on nearly 10 million Americans.

That would mean that the rich would pay more in taxes than they do today, and the middle class would pay less.

Moreover, if this proposal were implemented, it would reduce government revenue by $480 billion in 2013.

The top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their taxes increase

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has blocked a Russian company from importing luxury cosmetics, such as Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry, after finding that the products contained the banned substance aconite.

The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) halted the imports of the products on Friday, after determining that the products had been imported from Russia and were being shipped to the United States.

The agency cited "concerns about possible aconite contamination from a supplier in Russia," according to a statement from the department.

The agency cited a report from a Russian customs officer that the products were found to contain aconite - a substance that is used to treat fissures and cracks in stone and marble.

"The chemical is valued as a pigment used in the production of French furniture, other hardwoods, and porcelain," the statement said. "Aconite is used to give stone and marble its natural color."

The products were being sold for about $2,700 each at stores in the United States. According to the statement, the products would be returned to Russia once the agency verified the origin of the materials.

"As a result, the products cannot be released for sale in the United States," the statement said.

The statement said that the products were not banned in the United States.

Acanite was banned in the United States in 1997, with a 20-year ban on imports.

The agency said it is working with the Food and Drug Administration to determine if the products have been changed at the point of sale or if the products do not pose a health risk.

Acanite is a natural material that can be found in the Earth's crust, but is also used in the production of ceramics.

Acanite is a colorless, odourless and tasteless substance that is used to color ceramic glazes.

In 2008, an investigation by CBS News revealed how aconite was used to color hardwoods, including oak, maple, cherry, maple, birch, maple and alder, to create dazzling patterns.

ABC News reported that federal and state officials discovered the use of aconite to color hardwoods in the late 1970s. It was then banned by the EPA.

In the 1990s, the EPA discovered that aconite was used in the production of ceramics and that the agency had allowed the practice to continue despite knowing of the potential health risks.

The FDA said in a statement that it does not comment on pending litigation.

Other luxury Italian brands that have banned Russia from importing their products include Chanel, Hermès, Gucci, Prada and Valentino.

In April, the FDA announced that it was investigating a Japanese herbal and tonic product called 'Cosmos' that contained the banned substance.

The FDA said it is not aware of any public health risk associated with the product, but the agency is continuing its investigation to determine if any safety concerns remain.<|endoftext|>What's wrong with the world? I mean really, what's wrong with it? Every day I literally see people born into horrible situations. Some literally - in this country right now, you are born into a situation of suffering and oppression.

Right now, in the United States, you have people who are in prison or in jail. You have people who are homeless, you have people who are hungry, you have people who don't have health insurance. You have people who are living in fear of losing their jobs, of losing their families. And then you have people who are dead.

And the world, it looks to me like, is not doing anything for these people.

And what are we doing? We are talking about a global crisis where we are not talking about the most vulnerable people, but we are talking about the richest people in the world. We are talking about people who have the power to do something about it. And we are talking about the United States of America.

So I just wanted to read one of your speeches. You said that the world is a reflection of the mind. And really, who is speaking to the world about this?

The Iranian government has the right to do what it wants, but in this case, it should not take such a drastic step that will have a significant effect on the health of the people.

The government should take a more measured approach to the situation and consider a ban on the sale of petrol to the country to reduce the gap between the cost of fuel and the price of sugar.<|endoftext|>I've always been fascinated with the quote "you can't teach an old dog new tricks." It's a timeless piece of wisdom. The truth is that we've had to teach ourselves how to swim and ride a bike. We've had to relearn some basic skills. We've had to learn how to navigate the world. (I'm just saying, it's not a bad idea.)

But the thing is, those things are not easy. As I've learned more about the world and its people, I've discovered the best way to improve myself is to take a step back and observe and learn from those around me.

When people talk about learning new things, they're usually talking about how they did something for the first time. They're describing what it's like to do something for the first time. They're describing what it feels like to embrace new experiences, to take a leap of faith, to explore, to go beyond what you've been doing.

When I was just starting out, I didn't have anyone to bounce ideas off of. I didn't have anyone to talk about my ideas with. I didn't have anyone to learn from. I didn't have anyone to ask. I learned how to swim by watching other people I admired, but I didn't know how to talk myself into the water.

I started taking photos of myself taking photos of myself. After a while, there were so many of me. I was a pretty shy and reserved person, so I had no idea what to do with all these photos. I didn't want to use them; I didn't want to show anyone they were mine, so I decided to use them as wall decor.

I still have a bunch of them.

I'm not sure if the wall is still there. I'm not sure if it's still there. But I do know that I learned how to swim by taking a bunch of photos of myself in the water. It's like taking a bunch of photos of yourself being a super-intelligent, super-willing, super-creative, super-smart, super-smart person.

I took those photos. I took them multiple times. I reflected on how I felt after each photo. I played around with the camera a little. I got lost in the moment.

And now, I'm a better swimmer.<|endoftext|>I have a secret. I'm not a good cook. I buy the cheapest of ingredients and just throw it in the oven.

Well, I'm about to admit that there's one thing I don't do.

I don't cook anything after it's been sitting out for a few days.

I've been lazy.

I just want to eat what I've cooked.

I don't need to cook, I need to eat.

I just really can't stand the thought of wasting a perfectly good meal.

Nowitzki was open about that in a recent interview with the New York Daily News, saying he knew he was playing through injuries in the first two months of the season, but it was the late-season slide that ultimately cost the Mavericks the playoffs. Nowitzki said he's still not sure if he made the right decision to sit out.

"I don't know exactly what my thought process was, but I certainly felt like I could have helped the team and the team could have helped me," Nowitzki said. "But I didn't think it was in my heart to play."

Nowitzki averaged 23.0 points, 7.2 rebounds and 3.7 assists last season, but he actually missed 37 games over the last two months of the season. He started only 19 of those games, finishing with averages of 1.3 points and 0.9 rebounds in 12.8 minutes per game.

"I didn't want to miss any more games," Nowitzki said. "I think the team could have gotten better without me. I was obviously hurt, but it was frustrating, because I just wanted to be out there."

With the Mavericks last season, Nowitzki was injured for 63 games

The first few days of the war were difficult for Armenian civilians. They were besieged in the valley of Nagorno-Karabakh and forced to flee from the advancing Azerbaijani army. In revenge, the army of the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh fired on the villages, killing hundreds of people and setting villages on fire.


In order to hide the casualties and hide the fighting, the Armenian side began to cover up the attacks by providing exaggerated details. The Armenian side also started to accuse the Azerbaijani side of conducting guerrilla warfare, an accusation that was not supported by any evidence.


Once the war became a real war, the Armenian side also began to claim that all of its losses were caused by Azerbaijani forces and that there was no way for the Armenian side to win.


In the book, "The Armenian Genocide: A Modern History", (Cambridge University Press, 2011), I examine the evidence for the Armenian genocide. I demonstrate that it is incorrect to claim that the Armenian people were exterminated, that there were no massacres, and that the Armenians were not the victims of a genocide. I also show that the Armenian Genocide was a genocide, and that it was a deliberate, planned event.


I also discuss how the Armenian people have been denigrated and scapegoated by Western scholars and media, and the ways in which the Genocide has been used to justify and legitimize the occupation and colonization of the Armenian land.<|endoftext|>A veteran Toronto police officer who shot an unarmed man who later died of his injuries is still on the job, despite a probe into the incident that found he broke no rules.

The officer's lawyer, Peter Brauti, said the officer is still being paid by the force, despite the investigation that found his actions were "unprofessional and may have resulted in death."

Brauti said in an interview Thursday that the officer has been a police officer for 11 years, and that he is on paid leave pending the outcome of the criminal probe.

The officer's name is not being made public.

Police Chief Mark Saunders told reporters Wednesday that the incident does not warrant discipline against the officer, and that the loss of life was "tragic" and a "tragedy."

"The officer is still employed by the Toronto Police Service," Brauti said.

"My client has been a police officer for 11 years. The investigation is still ongoing, and the decision is being made as we speak.

"In all of his dealings with the police service, the officer has been responsive and has been cooperative."

The officer responded to reports of a man with a knife on a subway train in the city's downtown core last September, and he shot the man while he was on the platform.

The man, Joshua Cabero, was stabbed several times in the neck and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Brauti said his client could not talk about the case because he was still in the process of being interviewed by the province's special prosecutor, but that he was confident the officer would be exonerated.

"He's very confident in his position," Brauti said.

"He's in a position where he's been given a very, very difficult position, and he's going through the process very well."

But Brauti also said the officer will not be the same after a lifetime of service.

"He's been through a lot emotionally," Brauti said. "This has been a very difficult experience for him and for his family, and he's going to be a different person than the one that he is now."

The investigation found that the officer violated the police service's use of force policy, according to Brauti.

Brauti said the officer was jumped by a group of people on the platform, and that the officer then shot at the people who came after him.

"The officer was in fear of his life," Brauti said. "He was attempting to use only his firearm to defend himself from the attackers that had come after him."

The officer also was on the platform standing on the edge of the platform, and he didn't want to be struck by the train, Brauti said.

"The officer was in fear of his life," Brauti said. "He was attempting to use only his firearm to defend himself from the attackers that had come after him."

Saunders has been adamant that the officer acted within the law.

"He acted within the rules of the police service, the rules of the criminal code, [and] the rules of the province's Special Investigations Unit," Saunders said Wednesday.

"This is a tragedy, and we're very, very sad for the family of this young man, very sad for the family of the deceased, and we're very, very sad for all of Toronto. We're going through a very difficult time."

"We have a president who's going around the country and saying, 'I'm going to open this up. I'm going to let more people in.' That's just not going to happen."

Mr. Trump's order a week ago was widely seen as an attempt to crack down on immigration from terror-prone countries, although it did not address those fleeing war-torn Syria.

Mr. Mattis said the administration's latest policy — which was blocked by federal courts in a series of decisions — was still in effect.

"It's still in effect," he said, adding that it had a "huge impact" on training efforts.

Mr. Mattis also said that the U.S. military's approach to the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been a success.

"We've done more in three months than the previous administration did in two years," Mr. Mattis said. "We're going to keep at it."

By Sam Richey

(Reuters) - Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein on Thursday sued the state of Michigan in federal court over a law that banned her from appearing on the state's general election ballot, claiming the law violates her First Amendment rights.

The lawsuit, filed in Detroit federal court on Thursday, said state law is unconstitutional because it blocks a candidate from appearing on the ballot if they are on probation for a felony conviction.

Michigan Governor Rick Snyder signed a law in May that prohibited Stein from appearing on the Michigan ballot for the Nov. 8 election but did not bar her from appearing on the ballot in any other state that votes in its presidential primary.

Stein, a Massachusetts physician, launched a recount effort in Michigan, which sent Republican Donald Trump to the White House over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Michigan, which has 18 Electoral College votes, is the first state where Stein's effort was successful. Her recount petition powered by her campaign has raised more than $5 million.

"This lawsuit will not stop the recount, but it will ensure that Michigan voters get to have the chance to have their voices heard," Stein said in a statement.

Stein, the Green Party's 2012 presidential candidate, has sued other states over ballot access laws.

Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said the lawsuit was without merit.

"Unlike Jill Stein, I have never been arrested, never been an informant, never sought a government grant to conduct a recount and I have never forced a recount on a Presidential candidate," he said in a statement.

The lawsuit, filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court, argues that the policy violates the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment and the Illinois Constitution's right to due process.

The ACLU is seeking a judge's injunction that would require the Chicago Police Department to end the practice of stopping and frisking people without reasonable suspicion, and to adopt a policy that would make stop-and-frisk "a last resort" for officers, not the first resort.

The city has until Thursday to respond to the lawsuit.

The "stop-and-frisk" policy was first instituted by former Mayor Richard M. Daley and was reauthorized by Mayor Rahm Emanuel in 2011. Under the policy, police officers are authorized to stop and frisk people in public places if they have "reasonable suspicion" that they are involved in criminal activity.

The ACLU says that while the law provides some "reasonable" suspicion, police officers have broad discretion to make the decision to stop and frisk someone without reasonable suspicion.

The ACLU is asking the court to order the Chicago Police Department to adopt a policy that would require officers to inform people they are being stopped and frisked before the officer touches them and that the officer give a verbal warning before touching them.

The ACLU is also asking the court to order the city to provide a training course to all officers on whether or not they can stop and frisk someone without reasonable suspicion.

The ACLU says it believes the policy violated the constitutional rights of many people throughout the area under its enforcement.

"The Chicago Police Department has not implemented the City's stop-and-frisk law to further the public safety of Chicagoans, as required by the Chicago

"You have to keep your eyes on the prize," Jeff Soares, head of the University of Calgary's Institute for the Study of Canada, told the National Post recently. "That's the only way you can really win. And that's what makes Canada great."

Soares is right. There are many great things about this country, but the major one is that we take pride in our diversity. We take pride in our many different traditions and we take pride in our country's potential to be a beacon for the rest of the world.

While Canada's diversity is good for the country, it's also good for us. When we're the same, we're good — but when we're different, we're great. This is a lesson we can learn from Canada's most famous national pastime, baseball, and why it's the ultimate sporting game in the world.

Though baseball is the oldest of American sports, the game was born in Quebec. In 1796, Canada's first commissioner, a French immigrant named Louis-Louis de la Place, established a women's team.

Though the women's team won the national championship in 1844, their sport wasn't popular in Quebec, which at the time was a part of the United States.

That changed in 1866 when the United States entered the World War I. Soon, the demand for American-style baseball grew, and the women's team was revived. In 1868, the team was re-named the Montreal Royals.

The Montreal Royals became a major league franchise in 1876, and they still play in the National League today.

But before they could become a national franchise, the women's team had to overcome some Canadian prejudice. In 1877, the Montreal Royals were accused of being "French-speaking Yankees."

The team's leader, Jean-Baptiste Poulin, was a Frenchman who became a U.S. citizen in 1868. Poulin was French-Canadian, and his team was named the American team.

At the time, baseball was not a very popular sport in Canada. In fact, it was very popular in the United States, but not in Canada.

The original Montreal Royals were the only American baseball team that played in Canada — the Toronto Blue Jays were the first team in Canada — but it wasn't until 1913 that the Ottawa Senators — a team that played in the American League — moved to Ottawa.

Since the Senators played in the American League, they were forced to switch their colours to the Maple Leaf.

The Ottawa Senators still play in the National League, and have even added a Canadian flag patch to their uniform.

The Queen's University baseball team is the only Canadian team that plays in the National League. Queen's's even has a flag patch on their uniform.

The name "Queen's" is a little odd, but it's a tribute to the university's history. Queen's was the first university in Canada founded by a women's club.

Queen's was founded in 1869 by the women's college of McGill. In 1867, McGill organized a team but they disbanded several years later.

The men's team at McGill played in the American Association, which is the first major professional league in Canada, until 1871.

But for Queen's, the game wasn't easy. The school only fielded four female team members in 1874, and while women were allowed to play baseball, they weren't allowed to play against the men.

In 1877, the Montreal Royals were revitalized and renamed the Montreal Royals. They started playing in the National League, and were soon joined by teams from other Canadian cities, including Toronto, Ottawa, and St. John's.

The Toronto Blue Jays were not originally a baseball team. In 1875, the Toronto Blue Jays were founded by a wealthy businessman named Richard Williams. Williams was the son of the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

After the Blue Jays moved to New York City in 1876, they became a part of the American League. The team was also called the New York Giants, but the name was changed to the Blue Jays in 1882.

In 1882, the Toronto Blue Jays signed a contract with Leslie E. Griffith, a friend of William Lyon Mackenzie King. King was the first prime minister of Canada and had been, at one point, the governor of India.

When the Blue Jays won the American League pennant in 1885, the Toronto Globe printed the following quote: "The American League will find in the Toronto Blue Jays a most valuable ally."

This may not seem like a big deal, but it was a big deal. This was the first time that a professional baseball team, even in Toronto, was written about in the Star.

And this was the first time that a newspaper called a professional baseball team a "valuable ally."

The Toronto Blue Jays beat

The 2015-16 season was not kind to the Knicks. They went from a 52-win team in 2013-14 to a 41-win team in 2014-15. In 2015-16, New York finished with a 20-59 record, which means the Knicks had a negative net rating per 100 possessions. In other words, they were more often outscored than they were out-rebounded.

In 2016-17, the Knicks made significant strides. They reached the playoffs for the first time in five years and reached the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2013.

To get to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Knicks needed to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games and the Boston Celtics in six games. They beat the Cavs and Celtics, respectively, in five games.

The Knicks got off to a slow start in the playoffs, losing their first two games of the series against the Celtics, but they had enough left in the tank to make a run. In the seventh game of the series, the Knicks finally took control of the series, but the Cavaliers turned the series back in their favor in Game 8.

The Cavaliers went on to win the championship, and the Knicks were eliminated.

By beating the Cavs, they added to their list of "wins" in the 2015-16 season. However, it was a different story in 2016-17.

After dropping the first two games of the series against the Raptors, the Knicks were able to win the next four games to take the series.

They followed that up with losses to the Hawks in the semifinals, the Celtics in the finals, and the Raptors in the Western Conference Finals.

In 2016-17, the Knicks had a negative net rating per 100 possessions in all four of their playoff series.

The Knicks were outscored by an average of 4.9 points per 100 possessions in the playoffs, which is the second-highest differential in the NBA over the past 10 seasons. The only team with a higher differential was the Clippers, who were outscored by 4.8 points per 100 possessions.

Whether the Knicks can improve upon their performance in the 2017-18 season remains to be seen. The Knicks were only one win away from a 32-50 record, which would have placed them in the lottery. They had a 17.5 percent chance of winning the lottery.

The Knicks have a deep roster with a number of quality players. They have several young players who will only get better with experience, but the Knicks' roster is still filled with question marks.

The Knicks cannot afford to make any more mistakes in the 2017-18 season.<|endoftext|>The situation at the border between Israel and Gaza is still tense. The IDF is responding to rocket fire from Gaza and tunnels dug by Hamas, and is doing everything on the ground to prevent a ground invasion by Hamas forces.

Israeli air force strikes have targeted Hamas military installations in southern Gaza, and Israel has advanced its Iron Dome anti-missile system and the Israeli navy has been conducting bombing and naval patrols in the area.

There is no trace of an imminent ground invasion. The Israelis are still hopeful that the Egyptian ceasefire agreement will hold. The Egyptian cease-fire plan calls for an end to hostilities at 6 p.m. on Saturday, after which the IDF would start dismantling the tunnels and Gaza militants would return to the calm.

Hamas has not responded to the cease-fire proposal. The IDF believes that Hamas will not risk losing the tunnel fight, and that new Hamas leaders won't be willing to risk the loss of their people. Instead, Hamas has a broader strategy. After recent events, it is looking to create an Islamic "caliphate" in Gaza, and to do this it will escalate its acts of terrorism.

Hamas is also looking to consolidate its control over the Gaza Strip, and to ensure that it will not be weakened by the Egyptian cease-fire. Hamas is rebuilding its military infrastructure, and it is providing financial support to Hamas fighters in Gaza. It is also trying to get its own people to move from refugee camps in Lebanon to the Gaza Strip, and to keep its people in Gaza on a tight leash.

Israel and the United States want Hamas to leave the Gaza Strip. Hamas has responded by escalating its acts of terrorism, including rocket attacks on Israel, and it is increasingly threatening to fire rockets at the Egypt-Gaza border. Israel has to respond to this threat, and it is doing its best to do so.

The IDF's Operation Protective Edge has thus far resulted in the death of 1,939 Palestinians and the destruction of the homes, infrastructure, and infrastructure in the Strip. Some 2,134 people were injured in the fighting.<|endoftext|>See, I know this is a controversial subject. I know that it's not common knowledge, but I've been doing this for about 16 years.

"I'm going to be going back to school, and I'm going to be focusing on my schoolwork," Johnson said. "My goal is to be a special education teacher."

Johnson, 22, has been a quiet presence on campus, but she said she has been inspired by her friends.

Over the last few months, Johnson said, she has talked to her friends about the challenges they face. But lately, she has felt the need to talk about her own struggles.

"I think the best thing at this point is to talk about what's going on with me," she said. "I've been really lucky that I've gotten to come this far, and I feel like I've only scratched the surface."

Johnson said her wounds from past attacks have been reopened, but she said she has never been afraid to speak out.

"When I talk about my experiences, I don't just talk about the physical scars," she said. "It's how I feel about myself, about the way I feel about the world, and the way I see things."

Johnson said the pain she feels is different from the pain she felt before she was attacked, but she said she hopes her story will help other women understand the severity of their injuries.

"I'm trying to tell women that they're not alone," she said.

Johnson also hopes her story will help others understand how serious a crime assault and battery can be.

"It's not just verbal abuse, it's actually causing somebody physical pain," she said.

She said she has been aware of the impact of attacks on women for a long time, but she said it was not until she was attacked that she was able to see it in action.

"I had such a really hard time dealing with it at first," she said. "I was just really angry every day, and I can't really explain why it happened."

Johnson said she hopes her story will help prevent other women from being attacked.

"The reason why I went public with my story is because I don't want women to feel like they're not safe if they're walking on the street," she said. "I don't

There is no doubt that the international community is failing to respond adequately to the Syrian crisis. The situation is deteriorating rapidly. Syrian citizens have been seeking refuge from the violence in neighbouring countries. The humanitarian crisis has been exacerbated by the continued violence, which has led to a drastic increase in the number of displaced persons. The UN humanitarian appeal for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2015 stands at $3.7 billion.

UNHCR is ready and willing to help those in need but needs financial support to invest in the implementation of its work. We are particularly concerned about the situation of Syrian refugees and displaced persons, in particular around large cities in neighbouring countries.

With the assistance of our partners in the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, UNHCR is working in Jordan and Turkey to address the situation of Syrian refugees and displaced persons. The Red Crescent has been providing food, water, shelter, and medical assistance to refugees in camps and cities in these countries, and has established a number of field offices to support the coordination of relief efforts.

We are preparing a comprehensive package of assistance to support the refugees and displaced persons of Syria in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq, and Egypt. This package includes humanitarian assistance and development assistance for women, children, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups. In addition, we are engaging the UN Security Council to discuss the ongoing crisis, including the aim of establishing safe zones across Syria to shelter the most vulnerable.

If the international community does not take urgent action, we have concerns that the situation may deteriorate further, with further displacement of refugees and displaced persons, and further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Syrians in neighbouring countries.

We are seeking urgent financial support to respond effectively to the crisis. You could help us to help those affected by the crisis by donating any amount you wish.

Yours sincerely,

Gisèle A. Uzan

EU leaders will discuss the UK's future relationship with the bloc at their summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.

The issue of how to handle the UK's withdrawal from the EU has dominated the EU summit so far, as the UK prepares to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on 29 March.

Following the vote to leave the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May has said she would like to ensure that no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could form after Brexit.

It remains unclear, though, whether that would require the UK to retain the most favoured nation status for the EU's external tariff schedules, which would mean that customs checks would need to be carried out at ports and borders across the UK.

But a senior European Commission official has said that a special status for the UK was a "real option" and could be on the table if the UK lost the opt-out on customs restrictions.

"I see no reason why the UK could not have the most favoured nation status for 5 years, and the same for 2 years," said Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, during a visit to Dublin on Tuesday.

"We have to think of ways to keep the border open. I know that the UK wants a special status for a longer period. I hope we can find an answer."

Mr Juncker's comments came as the Irish government sought to reassure businesses that they will not be affected by planned curbs on the flow of people from the UK.

The office of Ireland's prime minister said the government "remains committed to maintaining the integrity of the Irish border", while the chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said the UK would have to "deal with the consequences" of Brexit when it exited the EU.

"We must ensure that the regulatory framework and the economic environment, including immigration, remain as frictionless as possible," Mr Hammond said during a visit to Dublin.

Mr Juncker's comments came as a senior EU official said that Europe could not afford to be "nasty" to the UK over Brexit and that the bloc's current approach to the UK's exit was "not working".

"We are now being nasty to the UK," said the official, who declined to be named. "We are not building bridges with them. We are not changing our approach. We are not building strong institutions with them. We are not creating new relations. We are not using the carrot to try and build the stick.

"We are not rethinking our strategy. It is not working. We are being nasty to the UK."

It comes amid concerns that the UK's exit from the EU could bring fresh uncertainty for businesses and investors.

The EU is already planning to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the bloc after Brexit and is already considering the possibility of

This afternoon, the Electoral College will vote to elect the next president of the United States.

The vote will be cast by an Electoral College of 538 electors. In order for the candidate who wins the most Electoral Votes (currently Donald Trump) to win the White House, he or she must win at least 270 Electoral Votes.

So, what's on the line?

Ever since I was a kid, I have been fascinated by the sounds of birds. I hoped to someday be able to capture these sounds in music. A few years ago, I wrote a piece of software that could generate and manipulate the sounds of a large number of birds. In this article I will describe how I was able to do this, and show how one can easily create their own bird sound generators using a Raspberry Pi.

To create the sound of a bird, you start by recording the sound of a bird. This is done by putting a microphone near a tree, or near the ground, or just about anywhere that you can hear the sound of birds. This is called a bird feeder or a bird feeder.

A bird feeder is usually attached to a building, which is where you can record a bird's sound. Then, you can use software to convert this sound to a desired sound. You can do this in a number of ways. For example, one way is to use the Audacity audio editor, and convert the sound into a WAV file. You can then transfer that WAV file to your computer. Another way is to use a program like Audacity, and convert the sound to an MP3 file. Then, you can use your computer to convert this MP3 file into an MP3 file. Either way, you can convert the MP3 file into an audio file, or VST.

I will demonstrate how to do this with Audacity. I will show you how to convert the sound into a WAV file, and then convert that WAV file to an MP3 file. I also show you how to convert that MP3 file into an audio file, or VST.

First, let's create an empty Audacity project.

Open Audacity, and click on New. Then, click on New to create a new audio file.

Name the file "bird.wav," and click OK to create the file.

Next, we need to import the WAV file into Audacity. Click on File, then choose Import.

Type the filename of the file, and click OK.

Next, we need to open the Audacity Audition dialog box. Click on the File menu, and select Open. Then, click on the Import tab.

In the Import dialog box, select the WAV file, and click OK.

Now, we need to add a filter to our Audacity project. We are going to use a lowpass filter on our audio. Click on Filter, then New. Then click on Lowpass Filter.

In the Filter dialog box, set the Frequency to 57 Hz, and the Gain to -3 dB.

Now, we need to add a noise filter to our audio. Click on Filter, then New. Then click on Noise Filter.

In the Filter dialog box, set the Filter Shape to Gaussian Blur, and set the Radius to -1.

Click OK to save our filter.

Next, we need to insert the WAV file into our Audacity project. Click on Project, and then click on File. Then, choose Import.

Type the filename of the WAV file, and click OK.

Next, we need to add the Audacity audio editor to our Audacity project. Click on Project, and then click on Edit. Then, go to the Audio tab and click on File.

Select the WAV file, and click on Import.

Type the filename of the WAV file, and click OK.

Now, we need to modify three of the parameters of the Audacity audio editor. In the top left corner of the editor, click on the Reverb button.

Next, click on the Phases button.

Next, click on the Tempo button.

Next, click on the Amount button.

Finally, click on the Cue button. This will reveal a window that will allow you to adjust the frequency, and the amount of the filter.

Now, your Audacity project should look like this:

Now, that we have the Audacity audio editor loaded into our Audacity project, let's do something interesting. We are going to play our audio file.

Click on Project, then click on Edit.

Click on the Import tab.

In the Import dialog box, select the WAV file, and click OK.

On March 12, 2016 in Manchester, New Hampshire, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton responded to the terrorist attack that killed at least 22 people and wounded scores more on the night of March 11 by calling for an end to America's "dumb war on terror."

Clinton said:

We have to be smart, vigilant and tough. We have to be just as relentless in pursuing al-Qaeda as we are in hunting down bin Laden.

Clinton is correct that the United States has a "dumb war on terror," which has been going on for 16 years. In fact, the CIA has been talking about a new "dumb war" on terror for at least a decade, according to a report by the Washington Post.

The CIA's "dumb war" on terror began in 2002 during the Bush administration. According to a report by the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Homeland Security, the CIA got the idea from the "dumb" war on terror waged by the late Senator Joe McCarthy in the 1950s.

The CIA's so-called "dumb war" on terror has been characterized as a "war for heartland hearts and minds" by former CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar.

"The CIA's effort began with a far-fetched idea put forth by former Senator Joe McCarthy in the late 1950s," Pillar wrote in the August 16, 2003, "Foreign Affairs" journal. "McCarthy's idea was to use constant, bipartisan fear and demands for war to mobilize voters and Congress against Communists, Communists-in-waiting, and, yes, even McCarthy himself."

The CIA's regime change strategy began in late 2002, according to the report. After the 9/11 attacks, the agency began working with journalists to promote false claims that Iraq had a nuclear weapon, to mobilize support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and to undermine support for the anti-war movement, according to the Senate report.

The CIA's "dumb war" on terror has included some of the most outrageous lies and propaganda in the history of the United States. The CIA's "dumb war" on terror has included the claim that Saddam Hussein was developing nuclear weapons, that Saddam Hussein had ties to Al Qaeda, that the Iraqi government had ties to Al Qaeda, that Iraq had ties to 9/11, and that Saddam Hussein had ties to the 9/11 hijackers.

The CIA's "dumb war" on terror has also seen the agency push the claim that Saddam Hussein had links to Al Qaeda. The CIA's "dumb war" on terror has also seen the CIA promote the false claim that Saddam Hussein had links to Al Qaeda. The CIA's "dumb war" on terror has also seen the CIA push the claim that Saddam Hussein had links to Al Qaeda.

According to a report by the Columbia Journalism Review, the CIA's "dumb war" on terror has been a huge success.

The CIA's "dumb war" on terror should be viewed as a major factor in the rise of ISIS, according to the Washington Post.

ISIS was created by the CIA, according to a report by the New York Times. ISIS was created by the CIA, according to a report by the New York Times.

The CIA's "dumb war" on terror should be viewed as a major factor in the rise of ISIS, according to the Washington Post.

CIA Director John Brennan said in a speech on March 26, 2016, in New York City that ISIS "came out of the same milieu as Al Qaeda in Iraq." Brennan said the CIA was "saddened" by the recent attacks in Brussels. "We saw, at the same time, this rise of this terrorist threat in Europe," Brennan said. "And as we looked at this threat, we saw a lot of similarity in the activities that were being conducted by ISIS and Al Qaeda in Iraq."

According to the New York Times, Brennan's speech was titled "The ISIS Threat" and was delivered to the Council on Foreign Relations. The Times reported:

Mr. Brennan spoke before a room filled with diplomats, former military officers and intelligence officials who have shared their expertise in combating the Islamic State. He predicted that the fight against the Islamic State would be long and complex, and that the United States should not "get bogged down in a quagmire" in

In the first of a new series of webinars, the Department of Defence is today releasing the results of its year-long research into the impact of the UK's decision to leave the European Union. The research shows that Brexit has had a significant impact on defence budgets from 2014/15 to 2017/18, with the trade-off of a smaller defence budget going to 'fiscal space' spending.

As part of their year-long research, the Department for Defence (DoD) are releasing the results of the research into the impact of the UK's decision to leave the European Union.

The DoD research – 'An assessment of the impact of Brexit on the defence budgets of the UK and EU member states' – compared the UK's defence budgets in 2014/15 and 2015/16 against the budgets of the remaining EU countries.

The findings show that the UK's defence budget has declined by £4.6 billion over this period, with the budget for the UK's armed forces dropping by 8.4 per cent in real terms.

The EU member states have been hit by a similar decline, with their defence budgets falling in real terms by 7.4 per cent over the same period.

The DoD research finds that the UK's defence budget has fallen to around the level of spending in 2009/10, while the EU countries' budgets are around 20 per cent lower than the UK's.

The research also found that the difference in budgets between the UK and the EU countries has been financed by a reduction in spending on defence and more than £7 billion in additional 'fiscal space', or money spent in areas that have little to no impact on the budget.

The DoD research also found that 'fiscal space' spending has comprised a much higher percentage of the UK's defence budget compared to the EU countries over the past 5 years.

The research also found that the UK's overall defence spending was lower than in the years before the EU referendum, when the UK's defence budget was around 10 per cent of GDP.

The DoD research, published today, was carried out by the Defence and Security Analysis Centre (DSAC), and funded by the Department for International Trade, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and the Department for Communities and Local Government.

DSAC Senior Research Fellow Dr Louise Evans said: "This is the first of a new series of webinars on the impact of Brexit on the defence budget. It is a highly technical, statistically robust, and authoritative analysis of the impact of Brexit on defence budgets.

"This is the first of two webinars on the impact of Brexit on the defence budgets of the UK and EU member states. The second will be published later in 2017."

Clinton told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing that while the United States would not be able to unilaterally topple the Iranian government, it could be a "game changer."

"I think we have to put on the table the possibility of joining with the Saudis," she said. "We will not unilaterally topple the government of Iran, but we will be able to significantly degrade their ability to make a nuclear weapon."

The Washington Post's top editors are calling for a "new approach" to the publication's coverage of the Trump administration.

The Post's editorial board said in a statement Thursday that its reporters and editors are "baffled" by the Trump administration's "troubling pattern of behavior."

"We have been troubled for months by the administration's unprecedented pattern of behavior," the editors wrote, "including its attacks on the free press, its disregard for the truth, its attacks on other countries, its attacks on institutions, and its attacks on the judiciary."

"The pattern is now so familiar that we can't help wondering if we're witnessing a presidency gone mad," the editors continued.

"We believe the media has a responsibility to hold the administration accountable. That responsibility includes not just a responsibility to report the news, but also to hold the government accountable."<|endoftext|>A father who was arrested after his daughter was found to be pregnant has been released from custody, police said.

The suspect, who is identified by the Franklin County Sheriff's Office as 22-year-old Andrew Warren, was taken into custody on Sept. 17 after his daughter, who is pregnant, was found in a water park with a man who was not her father.

Warren, who is married with a 7-month-old baby, was initially charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment and sexual battery, but was later released after a judge ruled that the allegations against him were not proven at trial.

His daughter had been told by the suspect that she was pregnant, police said.

The 6-year-old girl was found in a pool at the Ponderosa Resort on Sept. 9. She was later taken to an area hospital for evaluation.

The Franklin County Sheriff's Office was contacted by the woman's family who claimed she had been taken against her will.

"The victim's father has been cooperative throughout the investigation," Sgt. Scott Lewis said in a statement. "He is relieved to have the charges dismissed and is thankful to the sheriff's office and investigators for making this happen."

Even so, the economy is still at a historic low point, with a record low unemployment rate and a record high foreclosure rate.

The unemployment rate has been stuck below 8 percent since December 2010, but it's been stuck at that level for nearly a year now. The long-term unemployment rate is still above 20 percent, but it's close to a full percentage point lower than it was in the late 1990s. And the foreclosure rate is at a six-decade low.

The housing market is another bright spot. Home sales have increased by about 25 percent since 2010. And the stock market has also been on a tear.

In fact, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added more than 2,000 points since the beginning of the year. The S&P 500 is up about 1,200 points in the same time frame.

Related: How much have you already lost?

What's more, the Federal Reserve expects that the economy will start to grow at a faster pace in the second half of this year, although the central bank doesn't expect the job market to get much better.

"The labor market remains weak, with the unemployment rate continuing to rise and wages barely keeping up with inflation," wrote Fed Chair Janet Yellen in a statement.

"It is too soon to tell, and we may not be close, whether the economy can achieve full employment and stable inflation."

The Fed's current target for the unemployment rate is 5.5 percent. The Fed is widely expected to raise the target later this year.

The housing market is also improving. Home sales in July hit a record high. And the federal government has started selling billions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities.

Still, it's a long way from full recovery. At one point, the unemployment rate was hovering around 8.3% in June 2009. It hit 11% in July 2008.

The current unemployment rate is still higher than it was in the late 1990s, when the economy was in the worst of the recession.

But the U.S. economy is now back on its feet and moving in the right direction. And with the Fed expected to raise interest rates at its next meeting in September, the economy could finally start to clean up some of its financial mess.<|endoftext|>MONTREAL – After making the playoffs for five straight seasons, the Montreal Impact looked to have their hands full in
======================================== SAMPLE 66 ========================================
In the last few years I've visited many local museums. I've seen them in the wild, in antiques shops, at local flea markets, at first hand during public tours, and most recently at a few of the new ones that have opened in the last few years in or around Metro Detroit. There are many reasons to visit these museums, however, the most common is simply to be able to see a piece of history that is no longer visible in a home. I think that most people who visit a local museum are curious to see the history and legacy of the city they live in. They are also interested in seeing the modern art that surrounds them, to see how a piece of art may have influenced the way they think about the world.

As a recent visitor of the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (MOCAD) in Ypsilanti, I couldn't help but notice that the museum is located in one of the most tragic and desolate areas of the city. The museum is located in a former factory that housed more than 100 workers making headphones. The workers had a union, but were denied protection by the state. The factory remained on the building and the majority of the building was razed and abandoned in the early 90s.

I was fascinated with how the museum presented the workers, especially the ones that I knew from my own life, and why they were so involved in the photography and art that they made. The most interesting part was the fact that they were not just shooting random pictures of people. Yes, there were portraits of people, but they were not random. They were portraits of people that were important to them. They were portraits of people that they loved, and people that they loved were important to them. That's the kind of thing I love about society, and the society I grew up in.

While I was at the museum I visited a number of the exhibits, which included an extremely interesting collection of photography by Wayne Schuler. I was able to see some of his work at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and was excited to see where they had been housed in Ypsilanti and who owned them.

The majority of the museum's photography was taken in the 70s (I was there in the 80s) and 80s. That's when he began to be recognized nationally as a photographer. He was already a well known photographer in California and had been published in a number of magazines. He had made a name for himself and the city of Ypsilanti by photographing members of the Detroit Police Department and Detroit Fire Department. He was also a well-known student of the great photographer Thomas Cole, who had a studio in Ypsilanti.

Schuler was never accepted into the College of Visual Arts (CVA) in Denver, but he did get accepted into the University of California at Berkeley. He graduated from Berkeley in 1959 and had been accepted into the CVA years later. He decided to leave the CVA to practice photography full time. He was working as a photographer at the time and he had become so famous that he now had to find a place to live. He lived in San Francisco for a while before moving to Detroit and eventually settling in Ypsilanti.

My first visit to Ypsilanti was shortly after Schuler's death. I had come to learn more about his life and to see the work of the local art community. I remember being so ecstatic when I was let inside the "Best of the Best" exhibit. I knew that I had to find more of Schuler's work and I had to visit the museum. I knew I had to see the CVA exhibit, too, but I didn't even know where to start. I was just excited to take the next step. I didn't know where to go next. I didn't know what to look for. So, I started to walk around and took a few pictures and asked people where I could find Schuler's work. I got a lot of help from the local people and they pointed me to a gallery.

I walked through the galleries and started to take pictures of the artists. I found a few works and I took pictures of them. I found the works of the photographers that I had seen on the walls of the galleries. I kept on going, pausing at each exhibit to take pictures of the work. Eventually, I had many pictures of art and I was eager to find more. I found a few more works, some of them were from the 80s, some were from the 60s, some were from the 50s, and some were from the 40s. I had been looking for a piece of art that I could identify and I had found it. I had found a piece of art that I could recognize, and I had found a piece of art that I was able to identify.

What I realized is that I had seen Schuler work twice. The first time was in a gallery that was not open

The Dominos pizza chain will open a restaurant in the Lakewood Village Shopping Center.

The company, which is owned by Yum Brands, has signed a lease for a 15,000-square-foot space at the shopping center's intersection of South Main Street and East Main Street.

The company, which operates more than 2,000 restaurants, has been a longtime tenant of the shopping center.

It will be one of the first Dominos locations in the country to open in a shopping center built by The Homes for Good Foundation.

"The Homes for Good Foundation is deeply committed to making this shopping center a destination for residents and visitors to enjoy the best in shopping and dining," said HGF Director of Development and Rebuilding Michael Capriotti. "We look forward to working with Dominos to bring an iconic brand like Dominos to our community."

The new restaurant will fill a void in the Lakewood Village Shopping Center's food lineup, said Mike Sklar, the director of development for The Homes for Good Foundation.

"We are really excited about the opportunity to bring Dominos to the Lakewood Village Shopping Center," Sklar said.

The building will include a cafe, seating for about 120 and a drive-through window.

The property is owned by J.D. Wilcox and Peter Reynolds. The two launched a nonprofit foundation, The Homes for Good Foundation, to construct the shopping center.

The building is being remodeled to provide more parking and a higher-end look.

The project is expected to be complete by the end of this year.

Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) introduced legislation to protect the privacy of Americans' online activity. The Stop Mass Hacking and Cybersecurity Act of 2012 (H.R. 3087) seeks to make it illegal for the U.S. government to obtain a person's online information without a warrant.

"Americans' electronic communications are full of sensitive data that cannot be accessed without a warrant. The House Judiciary Committee will be hearing from government officials from both political parties on the need to address this issue and ensure the protection of the privacy of Americans' online information," said Swalwell. "The bill is an important step in protecting the privacy of Americans' information, which is essential in a digital age."

Rep. Lofgren said, "I am proud to champion the Stop Mass Hacking and Cybersecurity Act of 2012 and to join in the bipartisan effort to protect the privacy of Americans' online information. We need to ensure that the government has the tools it needs to prevent and punish hacking and cyberterrorism, but we also need to give Americans the confidence that their data is secure. This bill protects Americans' data and responds to the concerns of privacy advocates and technology companies."

The bill is co-sponsored by Reps. John Conyers (D-MI), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Tim Ryan (D-OH), Luis V. Gutiérrez (D-IL), Darrell Issa (R-CA), Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), and John Conyers Jr. (D-MI).

The legislation would provide that no federal agency, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, or any other federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, may seize or copy, without a warrant, any electronic communication or data that is stored or transmitted on a server within the United States, or that is within the control of a United States person, solely for the purpose of investigating a violation of any criminal law, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C., Section 1030), the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq.), the Wiretap Act (18 U.S.C. § 1801), the Espionage Act (18 U.S.C. § 793), or the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. § 1030).

Brady becomes the third head coach for the Red Bulls since their return to MLS in 2015, following Jesse Marsch and Mike Petke.

Brady was appointed New Zealand coach in January, leading his country to the quarterfinal of the 2015 World Cup. In his first four years as coach of the national team, Brady won three of his four games in the World Cup qualification tournament.

The 37-year-old's coaching career began in 1999, when he joined the Kiwi national team. Brady played for the Red Bulls since 2006, after being obtained by Red Bull via a trade with the New York Cosmos. He was part of the '06 team that won the MLS Supporters' Shield. He was also a member of the Red Bulls' 2007 MLS Cup championship team.

"It is truly an honor to have been given the opportunity to lead New York Red Bulls," Brady said. "I'm excited about the opportunities ahead and the opportunity to build a winning culture in an organization that has always been focused on soccer success. I'm grateful for the opportunity and look forward to building on the foundations that Mike and Jesse have laid."

After three successful seasons with New York, Brady was fired by the club in January 2014.

"I am very proud of what we have accomplished together, and are very excited to see what the future holds for this incredible club," Marsch said. "I would like to thank Dylan Brady for his contributions to the club, and wish him all the best as he joins us as our head coach."

The Red Bulls finished a disappointing seventh in the Eastern Conference last season, and missed the playoffs for the fourth straight time.

The team is currently in the midst of a huge rebuild, with most of its core players either on the roster or on the way out.

"We are in the midst of a major rebuilding process that will take time, but I am confident that the dynamics and chemistry of the team will eventually emerge as we continue to focus on building through the draft, USL, and international signings," general manager Marc de Grandpre said. "As we go through this process, we will share our progress and identify our goals and priorities. After that, I can say with confidence that we will make significant progress over the next several years, and very soon we will once again be a dominant force in the Eastern Conference."<|endoftext|>A man in Oklahoma is recovering after surviving a brutal attack by two pit bulls.

Emergency responders were called to the scene of an attack in Moore on Tuesday afternoon, and they found a man who had been bitten multiple times.

The man told the emergency responders he was walking his dog when a brown pit bull and a black pit bull began to attack him, and they also bit his wife.

"Two pit bulls attacked me, and they bit me on the face and all over my face. I'm okay, but I'm just very shaken up," the man told KFOR.

The man was treated for his injuries, and is now recovering at a local hospital.

The dogs are now being held at the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, and are expected to be impounded.

"I just hope that either the dogs are euthanized or they're put in some place that they can't do this to somebody again," the man said. "I hope that it's the right thing to do, and I hope that they're taken care of."

The dogs have been euthanized.

An orange Cessna airplane crashed near a shopping center in suburban Atlanta on Monday, killing one person and injuring five others, authorities said.

The single-engine plane was on approach to takeoff at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport when the pilot lost control of the plane and crashed in a wooded area about a half-mile from the airport terminal, police said. The pilot was pronounced dead at the scene.

Investigators found the plane near the parking lot of a Home Depot store about a half-mile from the runway.

"It looks like a bird struck it," said Major Richard Todd, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.

The Cessna that crashed Monday morning and killed one person and injured five others was on approach to takeoff at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport when the pilot lost control of the plane and crashed in a wooded area about a half-mile from the airport terminal, authorities said. The pilot was pronounced dead at the scene.

The pilot who died was identified as 64-year-old Richard C. Huffman. He had been with the Georgia Department of Aviation for more than 30 years.

The Department of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the accident.

"We are devastated," Georgia Department of Aviation spokesman Mike Bowman said. "It's just heartbreaking for the families involved."

Huffman had been flying the plane for the past month, Bowman said.

The plane had been parked at the airport for about a week and had been used for transportation, according to Georgia Department of Transportation spokeswoman Angie Wynn.

The plane had been in storage since its last flight in November, Bowman said.

The airport was closed until about 5:30 p.m. ET so the Federal Aviation Administration could co-ordinate the rescue efforts with the National Transportation Safety Board, according to a spokesman for the airport.

"On behalf of all of us at the airport, I want to thank all of the first responders for their swift actions," Georgia Department of Aviation spokesman Mike Bowman told reporters.

Wynn said that the pilot's co-pilot was not injured in the crash.

"The pilot was the only person on the plane when it crashed," Wynn said.

The planes are used to transport people to and from airports. The Federal Aviation Administration does not regulate the use of the planes.<|endoftext|>There are currently no running games.

"We will implement the constitution of the country," Chief Judge Wirathu said on Tuesday following a meeting of the Supreme Court, according to the Bangkok Post.

He added that the court would not issue rulings that might "impair Thailand's economy."

The court is expected to rule on Wednesday whether the government's redraft of the constitution is constitutional. The ruling is expected to be either favorable or unfavorable.

The new constitution, which was drawn up after a military coup d'etat in May, is seen as a step forward for democracy in Thailand.

Thailand's junta, however, has been criticized for failing to implement the fair and transparent process that the charter calls for.

The court's decision will also be seen as a blow to the junta, which has called the draft a "strictly drafted document."

Human rights groups have expressed concern over the introduction of the draft, saying it could be the first step towards further legalizing the military's decades-long rule.

The junta's critics have also blasted the court for not allowing a full and fair hearing on the constitution.

The Supreme Court is expected to respond to the draft constitution on Tuesday.

The draft constitution, which was written by a military-appointed panel, has faced criticism from an array of groups and individuals.

Human rights groups have criticized the draft as a step forward for democracy in Thailand.

But the junta countered that the constitution will be a step towards a "strong, independent and sovereign Thailand."

The military, which placed a number of restrictions on the election of the new leader of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra, in 2006, is expected to retain its grip on power.

We'll be posting posts throughout the week about the local LGBTQ community, politics, and more. We're also offering a variety of other in-depth features. You can visit us all the way from Baltimore to Washington D.C. with all of the posts you want.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage, the conversation about LGBTQ issues has become more important and more heated. In response, members of the city's LGBTQ community are speaking out.

Here in Baltimore, the conversation has centered on the fight for marriage equality, but it is also a discussion about the city's most vulnerable populations.

"We've had a lot of conversations about where we're going to get our housing. Where are we going to get our jobs, and I think we need to start thinking about where are we going to get our services for our LGBTQ young people," says 28-year-old Jasmine Corman, a transgender woman who is the founder of the Baltimore Gender Alliance and a member of the Baltimore Trans Action Coalition.

Corman says the conversation on transgender rights in Baltimore has been going on for some time. "Baltimore is very welcoming to trans people. We are the only city in Maryland and the fourth most populous city in the country that has a trans community. There's a lot of support, but we need more services," she says.

The transgender community is one of the largest in Baltimore. There are a total of 13,500 people in the transgender community.

"I'm tired of being treated as a second class citizen in this city, and I think people need to see that and they need to understand what our lives are all about," says Corman.

The city has created a number of programs and resources to help the LGBTQ community, including the Transgender Center of Baltimore, which provides a number of services including counseling, education and employment opportunities.

"They have a lot of people come in, but I think what they want more is services," says Corman.

The Transgender Center doesn't have enough funding to expand its services.

"I think this is not an issue that is going away. I think it has to be addressed," says Corman.

The Transgender Center doesn't get any funding from the city's Department of Social Services, but that doesn't mean that funding isn't available.

"There's a lot of ways to get involved and to create a stronger program, and I think that's what the city needs to do," says Corman.

Local political leaders have made the issue of transgender rights a priority. In May, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced a new task force to tackle the issue.

"The mayor's office has been working on the issue of transgender equality for over a year now," says Corman.

Her group has partnered with the Baltimore City Department of Human Resources, the Baltimore City Department of Health and the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Development.

The BBaltimore Transgender Coalition has been working on a number of campaigns to make Baltimore a more inclusive city.

"I want to make sure that we have gay pride events in Baltimore, and I want to make sure that more resources are available to the trans folks in this city," says Corman.

The coalition also wants to make sure the city's LGBTQ community knows that they have the support they need.

"There's this kind of new generation of people that we're dealing with that has not been marginalized," says Corman. "There's this group of trans folks that are starting to identify and feel comfortable with each other and have come together to fight for change."

Corman says she's glad to see Baltimore is taking this issue seriously.

"When I think about the LGBTQ community and how it was different 10 years ago, it was so different. It wasn't what it is now. I think it's time to start taking action on this issue and make some real changes," she says.

The Baltimore Gender Alliance has been sharing their story for a year. If you'd like to learn more about the organization, visit their website.<|endoftext|>There are many ways to use raw data in Excel. And there are many ways to use it.

The federal government's decision to make it harder for its employees to claim a disability pension is causing many to question why the government is spending more than $20 billion a year on disability benefits, when the number of people who need them is so small.

The government says it is projecting a $9.7 billion deficit in the next federal budget, which is a deficit that will be filled by a combination of a tax increase and the growing number of people who are receiving welfare and unemployment benefits.

The decision to reduce the amount of time pensioners can receive a pension, and the fact that the pension is now calculated based on a person's income, have led some to question why the government is spending tens of billions of dollars on disability benefits when the number of people who need them is so small.

Story continues below advertisement

"We [the government] are already spending more than $9 billion a year on disability benefits that will not be needed, and it is going to go up to $21 billion a year," said John Duncan, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. "The question is, why would we have to add to a $20-billion deficit?"

Mr. Duncan said the government is spending $40,000 on disability benefits, even though a Canadian with a disability will likely spend no more than $10,000 on the benefits.

"The government is spending $40,000 on a disability pension that will never be needed, and we are going to spend another $600 million on a program that is going to be needed," he said.

A spokesperson for Public Services and Procurement Canada said the budget will be released in the fall. The federal government has said it will not be releasing details of the federal budget until next week.

The government's decision to limit the amount of time pensioners can receive a pension was announced in the fall of 2011, when the Conservatives were in opposition.

The federal government has already announced that it will impose a new tax on individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year, and that the highest-earning 1 per cent of earners will pay an additional 10 per cent tax on their income above $200,000.

The government has also indicated that it will make changes to the Canada Pension Plan that will force some people to pay more to receive their pension. It has also indicated it will make changes to the Employment Insurance system that will force some people to pay more to receive their benefits.

But the conditions for eligibility for disability benefits are much more stringent than the conditions for eligibility for income security payments. People who qualify for income security payments are typically sick, disabled or elderly, but are not expected to work.

In addition, people who qualify for disability benefits can receive them for up to 20 years, which is much longer than the allotted 10 years for income security payments. In addition, people who qualify for disability benefits are not expected to work, and their benefits are not expected to be reduced if they do.

"There is a difference between the income-security program and the disability program," said Marc-Andre Viau, a pension expert at the University of Ottawa. He pointed out that people who qualify for income security payments are expected to work and that the disability program is intended to help people who are unable to work.

Catherine Sproule, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, said the government is committed to ensuring people with disabilities are able to obtain their benefits.

"We are working hard to ensure that people with disabilities are able to access the benefits they are entitled to. That's the key to protecting the public purse and keeping the Canada Pension Plan solvent," she said.

The disability program is one of the most expensive programs in the federal budget. During the last federal election, the NDP pledged to eliminate the program and to reduce the tax rate paid by high-income earners.

The Conservatives have responded by promising to increase the threshold for the disability program from $121,000 to $250,000. The government also has said it will spend $1.5-billion to expand the eligibility criteria for people receiving full disability benefits.

The government is also promising to increase the amount of money it spends on disability benefits over the next decade.<|endoftext|>The Old Guard has a new leader.

Lewis Hamilton's first World Championship title and the teams' title race at Suzuka are the highlights, but there is plenty more to enjoy in the first half of the season.

From the new McLaren-Honda-Renault adventure of Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen, to the battle of the heavyweights at Ferrari, to the first ever RBR-backed team to win the constructors' championship, we have a bit more than just F1 action this weekend.

With the recent battle of the fastest man in the world between Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton, there is plenty of excitement in the paddock.

But we also have a chance to see if the Vettel-Hamilton rivalry can be matched in the future.

We also have the chance to see how Renault's future looks, with the return of Eric Boullier and Renault's new technical director as well as new boss Carlos Ghosn.

This weekend we will see the first outing for the new car, with a superbly prepared drivers' meeting on Friday and a test at Suzuka on Saturday.

Here's an insight into some of the highlights of the F1 season so far.

Red Bull

Red Bull's first win at the Japanese Grand Prix was a sensational one, with Daniel Ricciardo's race-winning drive in the closing laps a testament to the team's ability to turn one of their cars into an outright winner.

The win put Ricciardo in pole position for the rest of the season, but it was not the first time he has scored points in a race.

He has been the first to score points in all 11 of the races he has started this season, with his best finish of sixth at the Australian Grand Prix.

He also won the final race of the season at the Monaco Grand Prix, but it was not the only time he won the last race of the season.

The win in Japan was only Ricciardo's second win in his career, with his first coming in 2013 at the Japanese Grand Prix.

The win in Japan was Ricciardo's first win in his career, and only the second time he has scored points in a race

The Canadian has been a consistent performer, scoring points in three of the four races he has started this season.

Although he has struggled for pace in races so far, he has scored points in all three of his races at Fuji, where he finished second.

He also took pole position at the Japanese Grand Prix.

Two wins and a pole position in his first five races will make him a very formidable force.

Red Bull have won four of the first five races.

He has scored points in four of the first five races

Ferrari

Fernando Alonso's strong start to the season has been one of the most impressive in recent years.

He has scored his first points of the season in Baku, but it was his second win in the summer break in Suzuka that was arguably the greatest achievement of his career.

The Spaniard won in front of another impressive crowd of fans, most of whom had not seen a F1 race until then.

It was arguably the greatest achievement of his career

Alonso's first win for Ferrari came in front of another impressive crowd of fans

It was the start of a strong run that has seen him score points in all nine races he has started this season.

Alonso has also won the last race at the Monaco Grand Prix, but it was not the only time he had won the last race of the season.

He won in Singapore, which was the first race back after the summer break, and he won on the penultimate lap of the race at the Australian Grand Prix.

Alonso also won the final race of the season at the Monaco Grand Prix

It was only the second time he has won the final race of the season.

It was the race after his Ferrari was involved in a huge accident at the Spanish Grand Prix

At the end of the season he was in the points in just four of the twenty races he completed.

That, however, is an improvement on the ten points he scored at the end of the 2013 season.

The win in Singapore was the last race of the season, and Alonso did not score points in the last race of the season

Hamilton

Lewis Hamilton has come to the fore in 2013, and won the last race of the season at the Monaco Grand Prix.

His first win of the year came at the Canadian Grand Prix, in a race he led all the way to the chequered flag.

It was also the first win of Hamilton's career, and the first time he has won the last race of the season.

What a way to go out, winning the last race of the year in front of an incredible crowd

The White House on Monday urged lawmakers to vote against a controversial Republican bill that would undo the Affordable Care Act.

The bill, which has stalled in the Senate as Republicans struggle to find the votes, would strip health insurance from millions of Americans and would likely cut Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor and disabled.

"There are many ways to improve the status quo," White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said in a statement. "But this bill doesn't do that. It puts the government between you and your doctor, and it does nothing to help people save money on their premiums or their deductibles or their co-pays."

The bill is "a Trojan horse designed to return to the days before the Affordable Care Act," Priebus continued, saying the GOP bill would give states the power to strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides a wide range of health services, including abortion.

"If you can't afford your plan and you live in an area that doesn't have it, the government will pay for it," Priebus said. "If you can afford it, you can keep it. If you can't afford it, you get to keep whatever you like in your health plan."

Democrats have repeatedly warned that the bill would gut the law and jeopardize coverage for millions of Americans.

Vice President Pence on Sunday urged GOP senators to vote against the bill, arguing it would result in fewer people obtaining health insurance.

"This bill is a step backward," Pence said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "We need to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act."<|endoftext|>…for several weeks in the summer of 2016. But as every college football fan knows, the ending of that season was not what anyone would have chosen.

After a week of panic, the Buckeyes began their ascent to the top of the college football world as they won their fourth national title in a row. The only problem? The U.S. presidential election was an overwhelming success.

Ohio State had been so close to being crowned the greatest college football team in America that they were already looking forward to celebrating.

As the Buckeyes began their post-victory party, they were greeted by a Trump supporter who screamed at them to "get a job!"

Twitter

The offensive outburst lasted only a few seconds before the Trump supporter was escorted out by police.

The tweet has since been deleted by the user. However, screenshots of the exchange remain.

Then again, it's hard to believe that this is the first time Donald Trump has been seen on the field in a Buckeyes uniform.

This is the second time in the past year that Trump has been seen at one of his golf courses. He was seen reportedly playing golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the U.S.-Japan World Series.

Earlier this month, Trump was spotted playing golf with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) at Trump National Golf Club in Boca Raton, Fla.

Trump has played golf with about every Republican presidential candidate since 1988. He has not played with John McCain, John Kerry, George W. Bush, or Mitt Romney.

Alice Parnell, 30, was recently hired to work at a clothier in Remington, Maryland. She was eager to get to work, but she was nervous.

Parnell, an African-American woman, is a single mother who works as a cashier at the store. She had a temp job at the store for about a year and a half.

When she applied for a regular job, she was turned down.

The reason: Parnell is too short.

"They told me, 'She's too short,'" she told ABC News. "They told me, 'She's not right for the job.'"

Parnell said she weighed more than 145 pounds.

"I have a very small frame," she said.

She's been told she's too short.

"I'm not even wearing heels," she said.

Parnell, who is not married and has no children, said she doesn't mind. She's not worried about her children.

"I feel like I've done everything I can," she said. "I've been there, done that."

The manager at the store told Parnell that she was too short and that she would have to attend a special training class and be weighed.

"He said, 'You're too short,'" Parnell said. "I was like, 'Okay.' "

Parnell is not the only one who has been told she's too short.

"They tell you you're too short. They have you come in for a medical, and they say, 'We're going to have to send you out to some type of training, and we're going to have to send you to the store to be weighed,'" Parnell said. "I was just like, 'What are you talking about? I'm not short. I'm not small.' "

Parnell said the store manager told her that she had to come back the next day to weigh-in again.

"I did, and I was so embarrassed because I was so embarrassed," she said. "I thought, 'I'm not going to be able to work here.' I was already so stressed out. I was already feeling like I couldn't do anything right."

Parnell said she took her concerns to the human resource department at the store, but was told that she needed to come back to weigh-in the next day.

"I said, 'I don't care. I'm not going to come back. I'm not going to come back,'" she said. "I said, 'I'll go home and get my shawl, and I'm going to do it.' I was so upset. I was so upset. I was like, 'I can't go back. I can't go back.'"

The manager told Parnell, "You're not right for this job," Parnell said. "I wanted to get out of there, but I felt like I couldn't."

Parnell said she went home and put on her black shawl. She said she was so embarrassed.

"I was so ashamed that I couldn't even work at my job," she said. "I felt like I wasn't worth nothing. I felt like I wasn't doing anything."

Parnell said she doesn't want her children to have to go through anything like this.

"My kids are born and raised in the United States. They have the right to go to school and not have to see this," she said.

Parnell said she called her attorney, who told her that she should be given a fair chance to work at another store.

"I'm not afraid to go to a store and tell them no," she said. "I'm not afraid to go to a store and tell them no. But I am afraid to tell them no, and they're going to say, 'We don't like you here. We don't want you here.' "

Parnell said she's been told she's too short and that she needs to go take a medical.

The manager who told Parnell she was too short told ABC News that he was "flabbergasted" that he was ever told that.

"I'm shocked that she would say something like that," he said. "I mean, I just...I'm floored."

He said he did not know about the special training classes and weighing.

"I never knew that there was a weight issue," he said. "I don't remember ever having her come in, and the next thing you know, she's scared and she's on her way out."

The manager who told Parnell she was too short said he understands that she is worried about her health but that he

The Queen was awarded the Order of Merit for services to charity in the New Year's Honours list. The honour, which is awarded by the Queen, is the second-highest civilian honour.

After retiring from the Navy, the Queen became a regular patron of the Royal British Legion and the British Red Cross Society. She also donated her £300,000 annual pension to the charities.

The Legion is the largest veteran organisation in Europe, with more than 2.1 million members, and the British Red Cross has a network of more than 500 branches across Britain, Europe and Africa.

The Queen's Garden Court at Windsor Castle, in Berkshire, has been the site of the Legion's annual Christmas Appeal for over a century.

Her husband Prince Philip was knighted in 2010.

The Queen's honours list has included only those awarded posthumously.

The Queen's honours have a long and illustrious history, dating back to before the First World War. The list was first published in 1901 and has been published annually since then.

They are composed of 11 items, of which three are knighthoods. The other 11 are:

The Order of the British Empire for services to the Commonwealth

Knight of the British Empire for services to the Commonwealth

Companion of the Order of the British Empire for services to the Commonwealth

Knight's Cross (Eton) for services to the Armed Forces

The Queen's Arms, a ceremonial sword, is awarded to officers who have received the highest service awards from the Queen.

Sir Mark Lyall Grant, director general of Her Majesty's Treasury, said: "The Queen's honours list is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding achievements of Britain's Armed Forces and their families.

"It is a privilege for the Queen to continue to be acknowledged for her services to the Armed Forces and the wider community.

"Her Majesty has always been a supporter of the Armed Forces and the Order of the British Empire is a fitting reminder of her wish to see Britain remain a strong and engaged global force.

"The Queen has today also been awarded the Order of Merit for her services to charity – a fitting tribute to the vital work of the British Red Cross in helping individuals and communities affected by disaster."<|endoftext|>The time has come for a definitive reckoning. The time has come for a full-scale investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of a man who was shot by police in a Berkeley courtroom last week.

The incident was captured on cell phone video showing a man being pushed by two officers — one of them identified as Sean Aranas.

Aranas' actions were caught on video. He points the gun at a lawyer and fires, hitting the man in the back.

His actions were captured on video. He points the gun at a lawyer and fires, hitting the man in the back.

The video has been released, and it is horrifying. Here's how it went down.

Two Berkeley police officers push a man to the ground

Sean Aranas is known to law enforcement as "Goon," and he is a former member of the Berkeley Police Department.

His arrest record includes a felony conviction for assault, criminal threats and resisting arrest.

He was a member of the Berkeley police "Riders" in 2014, a motorcycle club that works with local and federal law enforcement.

Police said he was involved in a road rage incident, and that the driver of a car hit him.

"His car was running a red light at the time of the incident," police said.

The victim, who was not identified by police, was taken to the hospital and treated for his injuries.

A red-faced Aranas is seen on the video, with the gun pointed in the direction of the victim and a pair of police officers behind him.

Aranas was arraigned for misdemeanor driving on the wrong side of the road, and traffic citations were issued, according to court records.

After the video was widely shared on social media, several Berkeley residents and supporters of the man who was shot spoke out about the incident.

The man, who was not identified, was taken to the hospital and treated for his injuries.

The Berkeley Police Department released a statement, saying, in part:

"The Berkeley Police Department is aware of the incident involving Sean Aranas and is currently investigating the incident. At this time, the Berkeley Police Department has not received any reports of any citizen complaints regarding this incident. The Berkeley Police Department will conduct a full investigation into this incident."

The video shows Aranas pointing the gun at the victim, who was being pushed by the officers.

Aranas then fires the gun.

The man in the back of Aranas' car is hit.

The officers then drag the man out of the car.

Just a few months ago, we wrote about a new project called the "Video Game Genome Project" which aimed to sequence the "DNA of video games." In addition to the sequencing of some of the games, the project also included an ambitious effort to create a "virtual DNA" map of the gaming industry.

That project has now been completed.

It's a big deal, because it has the potential to revolutionize the way scientists study dangerous pathogens.

The project, which was led by a team of scientists at the University of Utah, included members from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Utah, and the University of California, San Francisco. The team began surveying the video game industry in a different way. In addition to collecting prices of used games, they also looked at which companies were producing the games and how much money they made.

"We were looking at what's the market potential, what makes a game in the modern industry a big success? And what makes a game a failure?" says project leader Eva Zamora.

In this, they were able to begin cataloguing the genomes of the games they studied. In addition to getting their hands on the prices of used games, they also got their hands on the software that game developers use to make their games.

Zamora says they found that the software companies themselves weren't aware of how they were using their software.

"The companies that make the software are very secretive about what they're doing, and that's a very good thing," she says. "But then once you're able to put those genotypes on a map, you don't have to be so secretive anymore."

Zamora says that this is what makes the gaming industry so exciting to study. For the first time, it might be possible to take a genetic sequence of a game and then use that sequence to see what's in the game that makes it so dangerous.

"Because these games are so ubiquitous, they're so ubiquitous in our culture that it's almost always going to be in other people's genomes," she says.

Thanks to the project, it's also possible to look at the genetic sequence of the games in a way that was previously impossible. Until now, researchers could only look at the DNA of the games they had at their disposal.

"This is really exciting because we're able to sample the genomes of a large number of games," Zamora says. "Where we didn't have that many games, it was very, very difficult to identify these genetic markers."

The project was a big success. It was able to map the genomes of 126 games. And Zamora hopes that it has provided a means for scientists to study the genetic sequences of other games.

"We hope to be able to do this for dozens of other games," she says. "So this is the beginning of a new era of genetic mapping of games."

Zamora says the next step for the project is to put the genotypes of other games on a map so we can see what we're dealing with, and to start cataloguing other dangerous pathogens.

"It's a very exciting time to be doing research in the field of genetic mapping," Zamora says. "This is the first time that we've been able to map the entire DNA of a game."<|endoftext|>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) issued the following statement on the shooting of a police officer in Brooklyn on Wednesday:

"The officer who was shot by a man who was on probation was a hero. He responded to the scene immediately and lay down on the ground to protect others. These officers are our heroes. They put their lives on the line to protect us each and every day. There is no justification for anyone to take the life of an officer."<|endoftext|>It's a little hard to tell if the story has been exaggerated, but it sounds like a huge deal. The New York Times reports that the Bush administration is preparing to send 1,000 more American troops into Iraq to help fight the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

This is a huge shift. The Bush administration had been reluctant to send troops into Iraq. The new plan would bring the American war in Iraq to a close.

The Times reports that the White House is hoping to put the new troops into the Mosul area, where the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria — also known as ISIS — is now controlling significant territory. The Times says that the new troops are likely to number about 2,000.

The plan has been long in the works. At the end of October, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced a new strategy to combat ISIS. The plan was to deploy about 4,000 American troops to Iraq as part of a broader strategy to expand the fight against ISIS.

The New York Times says that President Barack Obama told the nation that the plan would include additional military advisers, trainers, intelligence operatives and vehicles.

This is one of the most time consuming things I've done in my life.

I have to write a lot of code to move forward. This is not a fun undertaking.

The code I wrote for this project is a lot of code. I'm not going to give it away, but I've written all the code that's useful to me. If you're interested in knowing the idea behind the project, I wrote a blog post about that here.

I've put a lot of work into this and I don't have any plans to stop.

The code for this project is a little bit different than most code I write for this project.

I don't use the for loop in the majority of my projects. The reason for this is that I find it hard to maintain. I like to be able to see the entire state of the program before I make a decision, and that can't happen with a for loop. For example, if I want to write ten times the number of numbers in a list, that would be ten for loops. If I wanted to write five times the number of numbers in a list, that would be five for loops. If I wanted to write twenty times the number of the numbers in a list, that would be twenty for loops. That's why I don't use for loops.

This is a little bit different.

The first thing that you'll notice about the code is that it's just plain old JavaScript. I'm writing a program that can be run in a browser. The main goal of this project is to see if I can build a web app that you can run in a browser. The second goal is to see if I can build a web app that you can run on a mobile phone.

The first goal is kind of easy because I use ES6 modules and the ability to have a global object in a browser. The second goal is a little bit harder because I can't use the browser's built in event loop. I have to do it myself.

The web app I'm building is meant to be mobile friendly and I want to be able to use the web app with one of my devices.

The code I'm working on for this project is a little bit different from most code I write.

I've been wanting to type this code for a while now. I've been waiting for something to make this happen. I finally found the right thing.

I've been writing a lot of code lately. It's been a lot of work. If you're interested in learning how to write code, I wrote a blog post about that here.

This project is a little bit different because it's a bit of a departure from the kind of code I normally write. It's a little bit more like a Python script.

The idea behind this project is to use a Node.js based server to run a web app that you can access on your mobile phone.

The second goal is to build a web app that you can run on a web-based server.

A new study suggests that the number of homeless youths in the U.S. could be cut in half if more young people who are "at risk" were to receive more treatment.

In the new study, researchers looked at the number of homeless youths who were in foster care, had a history of police contact, or both. They compared their findings to data on the homeless youth population in the United States.

Their findings suggest that between 2007 and 2015, the number of homeless youths in the U.S. dropped by around 8 percent, or approximately 169,000 people.

While a decline in the number of homeless youths is an important step, the study also found that some children who were homeless were "at-risk" of becoming homeless in the future.

The study authors wrote that there are many reasons why young people become homeless, and the problem is getting worse. In particular, the researchers expressed concern over youths who are "at-risk" of being homeless in the future.

"It is important to note that this is a population of nearly 500,000 young people, which is large enough to have a significant impact on the overall homeless population," they wrote. "However, the repeated high-profile incidents of youth homelessness in the news have highlighted the need to address this population more broadly."

The study authors said that the measures needed to address the problem of homeless youths could include expanding access to mental health treatment, establishing a system of housing and support services for homeless youths, and creating a system that detects and encourages the "at-risk" youths to seek treatment.

The study was published in the December 2016 issue of the Journal of Adolescent Health.<|endoftext|>The Brazilian government has announced plans to finalise a deal with a Brazilian company to build a vast tunnel with a 1.9km diameter under the Atlantic Ocean to connect Porto Alegre and Sao Paulo.

The plan is to start work in 2018 and finish in 2026.

The government is confident that the tunnel will be ready for use by 2026.

"We are going ahead with the project, and we expect at the end of the day we will have completed the project," said Brazil's energy minister, Edson Fachin, on Friday.

The tunnel would be part of a network of roads, rail lines and highways planned to link Brazil's two largest cities.

The current plan is to build a total of 24 major metro lines, 9 road tunnels, and 28 light rail lines.

The plans were unveiled last year, and the transport ministry provided a detailed cost and schedule for each of the projects.<|endoftext|>The phrase "you can't keep a good woman down" is often attributed to the famous American gangster Al Capone. However, there's no evidence that the phrase was coined by Capone.

The story is often attributed to the fictional character Al Capone, but there's no evidence to support this claim. The phrase was actually first written about in the pen name of Chicago author William J. Bennett, along with the saying "you can't keep a good woman down." In fact, Bennett used the phrase in his novel The Brotherhood of the Hammer (1890), which was published in English in 1894.

Bennett's claim that the phrase originated with Capone is also incorrect. William J. Bennett's book The Brotherhood of the Hammer is actually the only reference to the phrase that is known to have been written by Bennett himself.

"You can't keep a good woman down" first appeared as an adage in Bennett's 1901 novel The Brotherhood of the Hammer.

The phrase can be traced back to the 1880s, when Charles Dickens was said to have employed the adage to describe a woman. The phrase was also applied to Capone in the 1920s, which is where it was first credited to him.

In his book, The Brotherhood of the Hammer, Bennett wrote that the phrase originated with an advertisement for a bathhouse in the 1893 Chicago Tribune. The ad featured a woman with a bathtub filled with ice water. The ad stated that the woman "can't keep a good woman down."

The phrase was published with the knowledge that the phrase was in fact popularized by Capone, not William J. Bennett.

"You can't keep a good woman down" has since been attributed to several other notable people, including Albert Einstein, George C. Scott and Elvis Presley.

What do you think about this popular saying? Did you hear it said before it was credited to Capone? Or did you know that the phrase originated with the Tribune?<|endoftext|>The Most Powerful Race in the World

Ahhhh, the tough talk.

On the campaign trail, Trump's tough talk often appears to be self-aggrandizing, but you can't argue with the results.

As Donald Trump makes his first trip to the Middle East as President-elect, he will face the brutal reality of the region — a region in which foreign powers are working to destroy the U.S. through their own agendas and policies.

For much of the past decade, the Middle East has been a region of chaos, with countries like Libya, Syria, and Iraq in chaos or a state of conflict. The chaos has allowed ISIS to thrive.

As a result, the globalists have been pushing for more global governance, including a United Nations that will be more powerful than the U.S. government, a new world order, and a one world government.

In the past year, Trump has been sympathetic to those causes, and has called for a more aggressive U.S. military action in the Middle East.

Trump has also recently said that he would like to see more countries in the Middle East join the coalition against ISIS.

At the same time, Trump has said that he would use military force only as a last resort, and that he would only engage in military action as a last resort.

Since I first started writing about Trump nearly a year ago, Trump has repeatedly said that he would not engage in war for regime change in Iran.

While Trump has been sympathetic to the cause of regime change in the Middle East, he has also said that he wants to work with allies in the region and that he would not engage in regime change.

In addition, he has said that he does not want to engage in the nation building that the globalists have been pushing for, and that he would leave that to the military professionals.

With all of these facts in mind, now it is clear that Trump is actually trying to accomplish what the globalists have been pushing for since the end of World War II — a globalist world government.

Trump has said that his administration will be an "America First" administration, and that he will be a president more focused on America's national interests and not on the globalist agenda.

Trump has made the point that the globalists have not been successful in their attempts to create a one world government, and that they would now like to try the same strategy on the United States.

Trump's tough talk on the campaign trail was to be expected. He has been the most outspoken presidential candidate in the GOP field.

Despite that, Trump's "America First" policy appears to be working.

The campaign trail is long over, but the results of the election should be clear by now.

Trump won.

As Trump is sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, the globalists have lost.

Apple is now featured in the latest version of the online encyclopedia's online search engine, Wikipedia's most-used feature, according to a Tuesday blog post by the Wikimedia Foundation.

The search engine, which is also used by Facebook and Google, features results from Wikipedia articles that are not specifically about Apple products.

"By choosing Wikipedia's search engine, Wikipedia users can now find information about the iPhone, iPad, and Mac," the post read. "And it turns out that Apple is the most popular advertiser on Wikipedia."

The online encyclopedia lists the top 10 advertisers on Wikipedia, with Apple listed first and second.

The most popular Apple product, according to Wikipedia, is the iPhone, which received a total of 1.3 million hits from Wikipedia users. (Which is a lot more than Google, which came in second with just over 600,000 hits.)

The most popular Apple product "other than the iPhone," according to Wikipedia, is the MacBook Air, which garnered 2 million search results from Wikipedia users.

What's interesting about Wikipedia's search results is that they are biased toward Apple products. The website's search engine is better known for its unbiased search results compared to Google's.

As of now, the search results are only for the English language, and Apple is not listed as a brand on the search results.

If you're looking to buy an iPad and want more information on the company and its products, Wikipedia's search results are a good place to start.

They can be found in every corner of the world, but are most commonly found in gardens and on roofs. They can be seen flying in the sky, landing on windows, and even crawling on your skin.

Since they are so common, it is not surprising that people have long wondered what makes the pigeons so unique.

Pigeons are one of the largest species of birds in the world, but they are also one of the simplest.

The pigeon has a long beak with a sharp beak tip, and a short tail. It has a long legs that are either short or long and are angled forward. Then there is the pointed beak that the pigeon uses to peck at its food.

Pigeons are smart, social, and intelligent. They tend to stay in the same area and will often flock together. They are also extremely sensitive to loss of territory, which they will then exploit by stealing food and taking over the territory. Pigeons can be very fast and can jump over obstacles up to 60 feet high. The pigeon has a clumsy and clumsy flight, but has the ability to fly up to 23 miles per hour.

Pigeons make up their own language and will communicate with each other using a variety of sounds.

Pigeons have a very good sense of smell. They find their food by smelling it, and will also use their sense of smell to find mates. They can recognize and follow human scent cues.

Pigeons have a very large brain and it is the largest in the animal kingdom.

Pigeons have a good sense of hearing, and are able to identify human voices.

Pigeons have developed a highly sophisticated social life. They live in groups and will either stay together or disperse to new territories after breeding.

The Netherlands has (or rather hasn't) had an active Internet for a long time. It was the first country in the world to have a national Internet back in 1989, and even today it is the only country in Europe that can claim such a distinction.

The Netherlands is one of the world's leading destinations of Web developers and webmasters. In fact, the entire Dutch Internet is made up of (almost) entirely native sites. What makes this so is the fact that the Dutch have been using the Internet since the very beginning. They began the occupation of the Rift Valley in 1962 and established the first permanent Internet infrastructure in the Netherlands during the 1970s.

The Dutch also have a clear sense of humour, and the Internet is no exception: we are one of the most funny countries on the Internet.

However, if you are planning to visit the Netherlands, you will probably encounter Dutch words and expressions that you will not find in other European countries. Here is a list of the most popular Dutch words, phrases, and expressions that you will probably encounter.

Here is the list of the most common Dutch words, phrases, and expressions that you will encounter in the Netherlands:

It's no secret that the LGBT community in the United States is often the target of discrimination, both real and perceived. Whether it's a restaurant owner refusing to serve a gay couple, or a bar owner deciding to turn away a gay couple, the message is clear: the LGBT community is not welcome in certain establishments.

Gay rights groups have been working to change that stigma and discrimination in the country, and are doing so in different ways. One group, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, is taking the idea of a "no-reception policy" to the next level. The non-profit, which has been working to end discrimination against the LGBT community in the past, has announced a new initiative called "open and affirming."

The idea is a simple one: LGBT people who want to partake in events and functions hosted by the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) will have to go through an orientation process before they're allowed to attend.

"Open and Affirming" is a term used by the NCLR to describe the process to ensure that the LGBT community feels welcome when they choose to attend an event or function hosted by the organization.

"We believe that people should be able to join our community if they want to, and we will do everything we can to make sure that happens," Megan McArdle, a spokesperson for NCLR, told the Huffington Post.

"We are pleased to announce the launch of open and affirming, a new program that will ensure that people who want to participate in NCLR programs and events know that they can and will be accepted," McArdle said.

The program is aimed at LGBT people who want to participate in NCLR events and functions. McArdle also told the Huffington Post that NCLR plans to use the policy to help build a more inclusive political climate in the country.

"We're excited to be launching this program, which will help build a more inclusive political climate," she said. "We believe a political climate that is inclusive of many LGBT people is key to ensuring that all people in the United States can live their lives free from discrimination."

The initiative is a great step for NCLR, but it's not the only way the organization is working to change the status quo in the country.

The organization is also partnering with the Seattle chapter of the Human Rights Campaign. The two groups have teamed up to create a "no-exclusion" policy at HRC's headquarters and are working to ensure that all LGBT people feel welcome in the organization.

"As LGBT Americans, we are proud to have the courage to tell our story and to make our voices heard," HRC's Executive Director Chad Griffin said in a statement. "We are committed to advancing equality at home and abroad for all LGBT people. By working together, we will continue to make progress on issues that include ending violence against LGBT individuals, expanding opportunities in health care, providing equal protection under the law, and promoting the well being of LGBT people around the world."

Both organizations are working to create a more inclusive political landscape in the country. It's clear that the LGBT community can't afford to be overlooked and ignored. The time has come for LGBT people to show that they are still a part of society, and to change the social stigma and discrimination they face every day.

This is an excerpt from The Unofficial Handbook of the Federal Reserve System, Volume 1, Editorial Supplement.

Introduction

The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States. It is the second-largest financial institution in the United States after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Federal Reserve is part of the Federal Reserve System with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is the primary regulatory body for the Federal Reserve System. The Board of Governors appoints all of the Board of Governors' 21 District Reserve Banks, as well as the Federal Reserve Banks, which are located in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The Federal Reserve System is a private nonprofit corporation created by Congress in 1913 to promote the financial stability of the United States. The Federal Reserve Act created the Federal Reserve System and set out its responsibilities.

The Founding

In 1913, Congress created the Federal Reserve System, which is now the largest financial institution in the world. The Federal Reserve System was created in response to the financial panics in the United States of the late 19th century and of the early 20th century. In the early 1920s, many central banks, including the Bank of England, later the Bank of Canada, and the U.S. Treasury, had failed, leading to widespread financial instability. In response, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The Act created a central bank, or Federal Reserve Bank, to provide liquidity to the financial system. The Act also established

LONDON (Reuters) - London's Metropolitan Police have released photographs of the attackers, in an attempt to help identify them, but many Londoners are not ready to give up their hope of identifying the attackers.

The men, wearing suits and balaclavas, suddenly appeared at the gates of the British parliament on Wednesday night and opened fire, killing three people before being shot dead by police.

In their desperation to continue with the attack, they also blew themselves up, with one of the attackers throwing a grenade that landed near a police van.

The men appeared to have been known to police and intelligence agencies, but what made them so dangerous was their use of suicide bombs in the attack, as well as their use of firearms.

The images were released to the media as investigations continue.

London's Metropolitan Police will be releasing more images at the request of the media in the coming days, Chief Constable Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said.

"As you can see they are still being developed," he said. "Our focus is to provide the best possible identification that we can. We do have to take this all on board."

One of the men in the images is a British citizen whose identity is being checked, police said.

Police said that at least 30 people were injured in the attack.

Two of the attackers were shot dead by police and three died later. A further attacker was arrested at a nearby station.

The three dead attackers — two British men and a Pakistani — were "known to the police," Hogan-Howe said.

Hogan-Howe said the attackers had been inspired by the Islamic State group and had "deliberately targeted people who were out enjoying a night out in the heart of London."

"From what we can tell, the attackers were not just interested in attacking people, they were prepared to die in the process," he said.

Police are still trying to identify a fourth attacker who was arrested nearby.

Hogan-Howe said police were determined to identify and stop any further attacks in the city.

"We are determined to keep Londoners safe, to keep our city safe and we will do that in the way we always do," he said.<|endoftext|>An OS X 10.11.2 update may cause a kernel panic on certain computers that are using quad-core processors, Apple has confirmed.

The software maker released the update yesterday as part of the OS X 10.11.2 update, aimed at fixing a variety of bugs and improving performance. However, some users have reported having problems installing the update, with some reporting that the system reboots to a black screen with a red Apple logo before rebooting.

A fix for the panic issue is available for those affected by the problem. According to Apple support, the OS X 10.11.2 update is still available for download from the Mac App Store, but it is not recommended that users download it.

"The update won't work for you if you're using an Intel quad-core processor, and in particular, if your system is equipped with an Intel Core i7-3820, i7-3930K, or i7-4930K processor," Apple's support page reads. "If you're using an AMD quad-core processor, you are still able to download the update."

Apple has not yet released an official list of affected machines, but an online community leak from the developer community known as MacRumors has shown that it includes Macs using quad-core processor from Intel, AMD, and Nvidia.

Apple has yet to officially comment on the issue and to confirm when the update will be released, but it is expected to be available in the coming days.

According to the Boston Globe, the lawsuit was filed on behalf of Sarah Tewksbury, who was charged with carrying a concealed pistol in 2015 for failing to register her pistol. The suit alleges that the state violated Tewksbury's Second Amendment rights.

The suit is the latest in a string of challenges to the state's gun laws. In January, Massachusetts became the first state in the nation to ban the sale of assault weapons. Last February, the state passed a law requiring people to report lost or stolen guns within 48 hours.

A young man who was critically injured after being shot by a police officer in the United States is suing the city of Dallas, alleging that the officer's use of force violated his constitutional rights.

Ivan Allen, a 22-year-old University of Texas at Dallas student, was shot in the head after he witnessed a traffic stop in the summer of 2014. Allen was wearing a backpack with a gun inside, and allegedly displayed it when police approached him.

The Dallas Police Department claims that Allen was shot after he refused to drop the gun, but Allen's attorney, Jamie Crump, says that is not true.

"He had raised the gun he had in his hand, not his hand," Crump said in a statement. "There were numerous witnesses who saw both sides of the story."

Allen has said that he was shot after he pushed the officer away from his backpack, and that the officer, who was identified in a police report as Daniel Faulkner, fired five shots at Allen, one of which struck him in the head.

While the officer did fire his gun, Crump believes that police officers are often justified in using deadly force against people who are armed, even if they have a weapon in their hand.

"We do not believe Mr. Allen was armed, nor did he pose a threat to the police officer," Crump said. "The officers' use of deadly force was unreasonable, unreasonable under any set of circumstances, and constitutes wrongful death and bodily injury."

The lawsuit filed on Allen's behalf by Crump's firm, Crump & White, was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Dallas.

The lawsuit alleges that the officers "used unreasonable and unreasonable force" and that "the police [were] not in danger at the time of the shooting."

It also alleges that the officers' use of deadly force "was not objectively reasonable under the circumstances."

According to the lawsuit, Allen was shot after he approached Faulkner and asked him for his identification. Faulkner, who is white, then said he was a police officer and asked Allen to put his backpack down before firing his gun, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit also alleges that Allen was shot after he was in the driver's seat of a Ford Expedition and was attempting to drive away after the traffic stop.

Faulkner has been placed on administrative leave, and an investigation into Allen's shooting is ongoing.

[Ricardo Baca, a police officer in Mexico, was charged with killing four people in 2010]

The lawsuit also notes that Allen had prior criminal charges. Last year, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon.

"Ivan Allen was also a student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where he was undergoing his sophomore year in the Nursing program," Crump's statement said. "During his time at UT Dallas, Ivan Allen was a student of the police department, and he was known as a very responsible young man who was not a problem to the police department."

The lawsuit includes a criminal history of Allen's that includes charges of breaking and entering and retail theft, according to the Dallas Morning News.

Crump told The Washington Post that he plans to bring Allen's case to the attention of the Dallas Police Department's internal affairs division.

"We are not trying to retaliate against the police department," Crump said. "We are just trying to make sure that the police officer is held accountable."

The lawsuit was reported by the Dallas Morning News, which notes that Allen has yet to be formally charged in the shooting.

"I want justice for my son," Allen's mother, Rosalind Allen, said during a press conference Tuesday. "Right now, it's just so hard. I pray every night that God is going to give him the strength to keep fighting."

Allen has been named as a plaintiff in a federal lawsuit that accuses the city of Dallas of violating the civil rights of Hispanic residents. The lawsuit alleges that the city has a history of showing a bias against Hispanics, and that the city has not adequately hired and promoted minority officers.

The Dallas Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a game that still has plenty of questions to be answered, Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher put on a clinic on his team's fourth-quarter comeback in a win over Clemson.

Fisher pulled out all the stops in the fourth, and his Seminoles were able to pull out a 30-27 victory over the Tigers.

"When you're going to win a game like this, it's not about the event," Fisher said. "It's about the process. … This was all about the process. We played hard. We shared the ball. We got it to the rim. We got it to the locker room."

The Seminoles (5-0) scored the final four points of the game, including Malcolm Brogdon's 3-pointer with 10:03 left to give the Seminoles a two-point lead. That was the final score.

"When it was time to go, we knew we had a chance to win," Fisher said. "We just didn't make a lot of mistakes."

Clemson (4-2) made it look easy down the stretch, with Clemson getting 14 points from Trevor Cooney and two from Wayne Blackshear to take a 38-30 lead with 11:15 remaining.

But the Seminoles pulled away on four straight possessions over the final 3:29.

"We were just a little too loose in the first half," Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. "We got to be a little more disciplined in the second half."

Fisher's team finished 12-of-19 from 3-point range, with Andre Dawkins getting three. Dawkins hit a pull-up jumper with 3:04 left to give Florida State a 50-46 lead. Dawkins then hit another 3-pointer with 1:24 left to give the Seminoles a 57-55 lead.

"Just felt like we had a little bit of a jump," Dawkins said. "We were able to get the ball in their hands and just go to work."

Dawkins finished with 14 points and nine rebounds. Brogdon had a career-high 12 points and 11 assists. DeAndre Daniels had 11 points.

"I thought we were good in the second half," Swinney said. "We got to get back to the drawing board and figure out what we can do to get that win."

The Seminoles had lost two straight and were 0-3 in conference play, but they were coming off a decisive win over No. 10 Duke, and they wanted to get back on track.

"We don't want to get too high," Fisher said. "We don't want to get too down. We want to get back to the drawing board. We have to get better."

The Seminoles are No. 1 in the rankings, and Clemson is No. 4.<|endoftext|>JetBlue Airways Corp. is changing its policy after a passenger filed a complaint that a flight attendant at an airport in Chicago was verbally and physically abusive to a passenger.

The airline said in a statement Thursday that it had hired an independent investigator to look into the complaint and to determine whether the flight attendant, who is not a pilot, should be reinstated as a flight attendant.

"We are committed to providing our customers with an exceptional customer experience, and are discharging the employee in question," the airline said in a statement.

A manager with JetBlue, who declined to be identified, confirmed the airline is looking into the complaint.

The incident was captured on a cellphone video posted on Facebook by passenger Frank Fronczak. Fronczak said he boarded the flight from O'Hare International Airport to New York's JFK International Airport on Wednesday.

He described the flight attendant as an older white man who was speaking loudly on the phone and making gestures with his hands. He said it appeared that when he tried to change seats, the attendant told him to stay put. Fronczak said he tried to explain to the attendant that he was flying to New York and that he had a connecting flight to Chicago, but the attendant repeatedly told him to "shut up" and called him a racial slur.<|endoftext|>The Big 10 is home to the most prolific of all wingmen in the country, Eron Harris.

The Declaration is couched in the language of equality and political equality, but it also depicts a hierarchical society in which the common interests of the many are subordinated to the interests of the few. The book that many regard as the original document of American democracy—the one most people know about—is actually a work of propaganda.

It was not until after the American Revolution that the United States adopted a constitution. The first drafts of the Declaration of Independence were written by John Adams and his protégé, Benjamin Franklin, before the Constitution was drafted.

In the early days of the American republic, new states were created through a process called "ratification," which requires the support of at least 38 of the 50 states. The Constitution was ratified by 38 states; the rest of the states were not needed to ratify. This was the first time that a constitution had been ratified by a majority of the states. In 1787, George Washington was elected president and sent his signature to the Constitution.

In 1788, when the Constitution was ratified, the United States had a population of around 300,000, with the population of the states at around 43,000. The Constitution was written for a society of 300,000 people who had already fought a war for independence and were -- by 1788 -- a nation of around 234,000 people. The draft of the Declaration of Independence, on the other hand, was written in 1776, and the document was written for a population of around 476,000 people.

It is not surprising that the Declaration of Independence was written for a population of less than half the size of the United States. The Declaration begins with a statement of rights that was not yet recognized by the common people:

All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights... It is the duty of the civil magistrate to protect these rights.

These rights included the right to life, liberty, and property. They were more important than just a few people's rights. The Declaration of Independence was written with this in mind:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

As the idea of a nation-state becomes more and more foreign to the common people, the Declaration of Independence focuses more on the rights of the individual. The Declaration of Independence was not written for a people who had just liberated themselves from a foreign occupier. It was written for a population of mostly poor white people who had just been colonized by another white people. The Declaration of Independence was written for a population that had been enslaved for well over a century. It was written for a population that had been invaded by a foreign power.

At the time of the Declaration of Independence, the United States was still in the process of being formed. The United States was a relatively small country, as it had not yet been divided into states. The population was still relatively poor, as most people were still slaves. The population was still predominately white, as it would be for the next two centuries. The population was not yet racially homogenous, as it would be for the next

On Twitter, police said the man was killed in the shooting. They also said an investigation was underway to determine the circumstances surrounding the shooting.

"There's a lot to be determined here, and I'd like to ask that people keep an open mind," said Insp. Bill Hunter, who is leading the investigation.

"It is an ongoing investigation, so I'd ask everyone to keep an open mind."

Police have not released any information about the relationship between the men or responded to media questions about the motive for the shooting.

A police source, however, told the Calgary Herald that the shooting appeared to be in retaliation for a crime committed earlier that day.

"We believe it was a road rage incident and that's why we're investigating it as a road rage incident," Hunter added.

"The investigation is underway to determine if there may be any connection between the incident and the earlier incident."

Police are asking anyone with information about the shooting to call them at 403-266-1234 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.<|endoftext|>For the first time in nearly half a century, the U.S. has no official national anthem.

It's been nearly a century since the last time the U.S. had a national anthem.

In September 1950, President Harry Truman signed the National Anthem Bill into law, providing for a national anthem. The bill was signed by Truman on September 19, 1950.

The bill had two main sections, one for Congress and one for the executive branch.

Congress created the National Anthem Act of 1950, with the following definition:

"The national anthem shall be played before every public performance of the plays of the Shakespearean period, and shall be sung at all national anthems of a religious nature, and at any other time when the national anthem is rendered as a part of every act of assembly or when the national anthem is played in connection with any other event."

The bill also included a provision that prohibited the playing of any other song than the national anthem at any national event.

The bill expired on January 1, 1957. It was not renewed.

In their place, the National Anthem Act of 1957 was passed, giving the president the ability to appoint an officer to play the national anthem.

The National Anthem Act of 1957 had a two-part purpose:

"The first part of the Act concerns the President's authority to appoint a person to play the national anthem. If he chooses to do so, he is required to appoint an officer who is "qualified in his position and service to play the national anthem." The second part of the Act provides for the appointment of a person to play the National Anthem at any event that occurs on or before September 16, 1957. The person appointed to play the National Anthem at an event that occurs on or before September 16, 1957, shall be "qualified in his position and service to play the national anthem."

The bill was signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on February 2, 1957.

The last official national anthem was played on September 16, 1961, by the Kansas City Chiefs at the end of their game against the Boston Patriots at Boston Garden.

The last time the national anthem was played in the United States was during the 20th Anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The previous time the national anthem was played in the United States was in 1952.

He's back.

The "Air Force One" star's first-ever solo appearance on the cover of Rolling Stone was a full-blown media event, and not just because of the photo shoot.

In the months since President Donald Trump was sworn in, his everyday life has been overshadowed by the other, more important part of his job: being commander in chief.

"I've been in the White House for about as long as the president has been in office, and it's been pretty amazing," he told the magazine.

"The number of people who have called to thank me for my service is as high as it's ever been. I mean, literally in the months after [the election], people would call up to thank me for my service. And I was very honored by that."

Certain things have made headlines, but it's the way in which Trump has changed his life on the campaign trail that's garnered the most attention.

Props to @RollingStone for finally featuring me & speaking my mind. I'm honored to be a part of the team. @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/qgV9VlX9Bc — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017

The magazine's cover story, initially published in November, is unlikely to go down in history as one of the most controversial in its history. That title probably belongs to the "Access Hollywood" tape, in which Trump was caught on tape bragging about grabbing women by their breasts and sexually assaulting them without their consent.

Rolling Stone editor-in-chief Jann Wenner at the time defended the publication's decision to run the piece, saying it had "the power to shape the course of our nation's conversation about sexual assault, and we believe it does just that."

"We are confident that our readers will reach a similar conclusion," Wenner added.

But that didn't stop some readers from accusing Rolling Stone of being a "pro-Trump publication" that was "getting ready to attack the president and his administration."

And the president was not happy.

A recent tweet from the president suggested the magazine was "trying to silence my voice."

"The failing @nytimes has disgraced the media world. Gotten me wrong for two solid years. Change libel laws?" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.

The failing @nytimes has disgraced the media world. Gotten me wrong for two solid years. Change libel laws? https://t.co/d92EbUv9jt — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017

Trump was referring to a New York Times investigation in which the newspaper reported the president had been engulfed in a sexual harassment scandal long before he was elected.

The president also took to Twitter on Wednesday to suggest the magazine had "tried to silence my voice."

A few hours later, Rolling Stone responded to the president's tweet.

"The president is correct about one thing: We did not silence his voice. We published his voice — with his permission, of course — because we believe it is important to hold the president accountable for his words and actions."

A few hours later, the magazine released another tweet saying, "We stand by our reporting and believe our reporting was accurate."

We stand by our reporting and believe our reporting was accurate. https://t.co/4RKa8dVd9y — Rolling Stone (@RollingStone) April 1, 2017

It's not the first time Trump has been criticized for his conduct as president.

Earlier this year, the White House was forced to defend a statement Trump made to Time magazine's Matt Lauer, which was taken as a sexist attack.

"You know, I think she does pose a threat, and I think she does deserve what she's getting," Trump said during a taping of "The View."

"And I think she should be ashamed of herself for what she's done."

The president later apologized, but not before Time magazine said it would no longer cover him.

But the White House didn't back down.

"It's not the first time he's said something sexist, and it won't be the last time," White House press secretary Sean Spicer said at the time.

"The president is a man of strong beliefs and strong beliefs have consequences," Spicer said. "The president is going to speak for himself."

The new version of the Android market has a new theme and it is called Material Design. Well this is not the same as the old Material Design but it is a new design. Let me explain with an example. Let's say you have a Facebook app. You have a Facebook app and you want to show a little bit of the page to the user. You can do so by using a 'like' button. This is Material Design.

Material Design is a new design, but it is not like the old one. The old one was a flat design with a light background and white text. Material Design is different. The new one is more like a flat design. The app is now not white, it is not flat but it has a light background. The simple grey background is the main color and the rest of the colors are used to put different kinds of text. The text is now more light and it is not very dark like the old one.

I was wondering why the new app doesn't look like the old one, but it is not because of the new design. It is because of the old design. The old one had a black background, yellow text and orange background. The new one has a dark grey background and light yellow text. The orange background is still there but it is no longer used. The new design is more like a flat design than the old one.

The new design is not perfect though. There are some issues with the new design. The new design can not be used for the root apps. This is because they have to be built using the new style. The new style is meant for apps that are running in the launcher or apps that are running in the application drawer. If the app is running in the app drawer the new design will not work.

So to make the new design work for the apps that are running in the launcher or the app drawer, you need to use the old style. The old style is not available in the market yet and the only way to get the old style is to use the old style apps. The reason for this is that Google wants to make the market more stable. The old style apps are the ones that will not break the new style apps.

Some of the problems with the new design are the buttons. The buttons are now bigger and not as small as before. The buttons are so big that they are very hard to use for some users. There is a new visual for the 'back' button. It has a small 'bubble' and it makes the button look more like a menu button. The bubbles are there because they are there to make the buttons easier to use.

There are some issues with the new design. There are certain situations where the old style still works better. If you have a small screen, then the old style may be better because the text is smaller. You can also use the old style if you have a large screen. The text is very large on a large screen but on a small screen it is small. You can use the old style if you want something that is not very small.

If you use the old style then you can use the new style. You can also use the new style if you have a large screen. The new style is easier to use than the old style. You can use the new style if you want something simple. The old style is not as easy to use as the new style, but it is easy.

The new design is not the best one. It is not the best design for the market. But it is better than the old design. The new design is a nice change, but it is not the best one. But it is better than the old design.

I am not a big fan of Material Design. I think it is a good idea but it is not the best one. I will try to use the old style until the new style is available.<|endoftext|>"Waking up in the morning, I would look out and see a beautiful, clear day.

In a wide-ranging interview with Kotaku, the designer/director of Mario, Zelda and Donkey Kong, who is currently working on his first game in over a decade, revealed that in the early days, he wasn't exactly sure what he wanted to do with his life.

At the end of the last Ice Age, around 12,000 years ago, the planet's climate was remarkably stable. But it wasn't as stable as it is today.

In fact, it took just one tiny change in the climate to turn the planet into something utterly unlike what we see today.

For millions of years, the ice sheets covering most of North America and Europe were slowly melting, eventually creating huge lakes and rivers. Then, about 12,000 years ago, this started to change.

The scientists behind a study published today in Nature Geoscience say that a giant ice sheet covering Europe was melting at a pace of about 3 metres per year, at a time when the northern hemisphere was in the midst of a warmer period.

Previous studies have shown that the North Atlantic Ocean was warming, which would have made it easier for warm water to reach the north pole. But the new study is the first to show that the warm water was reaching the North Atlantic Ocean as well.

Over time, these North Atlantic changes would have melted the ice sheets covering Greenland and North America, causing sea levels to rise.

'The big picture is that the planet was very different 10,000 years ago,' says study co-author Ian Joughin at the University of Exeter in the UK.

'It's really quite remarkable that a single factor can really turn a planet into a completely different place.'

The researchers also looked into whether this change was happening more frequently, and found that it was.

In a previous study, Joughin and his colleagues looked at the ocean temperatures that were sensed during the last ice age, and found that they were at their highest point in the past 2,000 years.

But, says Joughin, the sea surface temperatures at that time would have been on average 2 degrees Celsius warmer than today.

And that temperature rise would have meant that the atmosphere was also 2 degrees warmer.

And as the climate warmed, the sea ice at the poles would also have melted.

As the ice melted, it would have exposed huge tracts of land to the sun, which would have warmed the planet even more.

It's only natural that we should be interested in what happens when the planet's climate changes, says Joughin.

'It's something that we know is going on now, and we're seeing it,' he says.

The work will be useful for modelling the future of the Arctic, he says.

'It tells us that we need to be very careful about what we're doing in the Arctic,' he says.

'We need to be monitoring that region, and we need to be doing research that's going to help us understand what's going on there.'<|endoftext|>This book is an excellent introduction to Topological Algebra, with a focus on the Algebra of Topological Spaces. The author uses examples from four-dimensional manifolds, including the only example of a spherical manifold, the Lie-Hilbert space. The examples are rigorously defined, with the standard function definitions and algebraic properties. The book also includes a number of exercises to provide the reader with an opportunity to practice the material.

The first chapter provides an introduction to the theory of four-dimensional manifolds. In the second chapter, the author explains the theory of two-dimensional manifolds, focusing on the Lie algebra of two-dimensional manifolds. In the third chapter, he discusses the theory of a three-dimensional manifold, the Cavity (or Theory of Surfaces), and the theory of two-dimensional surfaces. In the fourth chapter, the author discusses the theory of three-dimensional surfaces, including the Lie-Hilbert space. In the fifth chapter, the author discusses the theory of four-dimensional surfaces, including the Kähler space and the Lie-Hilbert space. The sixth chapter introduces the basic ideas of the paper by Laposky and Zaremba, which provides a better explanation of the principles of the theory of four-dimensional manifolds.

The text is organized into four sections. The first section covers manifolds in three dimensions and two forces. The second section covers manifolds in four dimensions and forces. The third section, which is the longest, is devoted to manifolds in two dimensions and forces. The fourth section, which is the shortest in length, discusses the theory of three-dimensional manifolds.

The book is well-organized. Throughout the book, the sections are numbered in a way that is easy to keep track of. The book also contains a bibliography, a glossary of terms and definitions, and an index.<|endoftext|>The first time I saw the "Kids" episode of "The Simpsons" was in 1988, when I was living in Portland, Oregon.

In an interview with the European Parliament's culture committee, the Dutch Dutch MP and member of the committee, Bart Staes, called for the European Union to adopt a "zero tolerance" policy toward pornography.

"I think the exposure of children to pornography is a major problem," Staes said.

"And I think it's a problem that's not just linked to sexual education but also to more basic questions of humanity, like: how can we treat young people who are not able to control their sexual urges?" he said.

Staes also said that schoolchildren should be taught about the dangers of pornography: "I think that exposure should be much higher than it is in many countries, because I think that it's a new subject," he said.

"It needs to be taught in schools in a much more profound way, the whole concept of freedom of expression. And I think that the whole concept of a free society needs to be made clear and clarified, particularly in a European context, that this is not something that we should accept."

The Dutch MP was in Brussels on Tuesday to lobby the EU Parliament to adopt a new policy on pornography.

The European Parliament adopted a regulation on pornography in December, which allows for fines and up to five years in jail for anyone caught selling or streaming pornographic materials.

But the European Commission has rejected the regulation, saying that it is too narrow in scope.

The Dutch government is currently working on a bill that would extend the scope of the legislation to include online pornography, which is currently exempt.

"The pornography laws are very vague, they're very hard to apply," Staes said.

He believes the state should be able to set its own definition of what constitutes pornography, but he also believes that the current European legislation is too vague.

A poll by the Dutch Institute of Public Opinion in 2014 found that 56 percent of Dutch people support an outright ban on pornography.

"In my opinion, there's no reason to prohibit the distribution of pornography," Staes said.

"There's no reason to punish people for the production and distribution of pornography. It's a question of freedom of expression."

The Dutch Parliament's culture committee voted in favor of the motion on Tuesday:<|endoftext|>CALGARY — A new study shows that the majority of the world's anti-Semitic incidents are not the result of anti-Israel sentiment in the Muslim world, but rather are the result of anti-Jewish sentiment in Europe.

The report, given exclusively to The Rebel by the Centre for Research and Information on Globalization (CRG), also found that Europe's anti-Semitism is the greatest in Europe, with a higher share of incidents than in North America and the Middle East.

"There is no doubt that anti-Semitism in Europe is rising, and it is not going away," said CRG Director Michael Khalili. "It is rising in Europe, and not only because of the refugee crisis. The reason for the rise in anti-Semitism in Europe is because of the Islamization of Europe."

The report, "Europe's New Anti-Semitism: The Challenge of a Globalized World," was produced by the CRG and examines the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe.

A source for the report was the European Union's annual report on anti-Semitism, which was issued in September 2016.

"Europe has been the first to experience the rise of anti-Semitism since the Holocaust," said Khalili. "As such, it has a unique opportunity to determine if the anti-Semitism in Europe has become a global phenomenon or if it is a Europe-only phenomenon."

The report examined the impact of Islamization on anti-Semitism in Europe, and found that the vast majority of anti-Semitic incidents — 94 per cent — are not anti-Israel sentiments, but the result of "anti-Jewish sentiment" in Europe.

"At the end of the day, the crux of the matter is how is anti-Semitism becoming more and more a global phenomenon in Europe," Khalili said.

The report examined the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe from 2002-2015, and found that the number of incidents in Europe grew by an average of 30 per cent every year.

The report found that anti-Semitic incidents increased after the start of the conflict in Gaza in 2014, and that anti-Semitism had increased by a factor of two since 2010.

"The report shows that anti-Semitism is not just rising in Europe, but that it is rising in Europe, and it is growing in Europe due to the Islamicization of Europe," Khalili said.

The report found that 12 per cent of the anti-Semitic incidents in Europe were perpetrated by Jews against Muslims, and cited a report from the Rand Corporation that found that Arabs make up 13 per cent of Europe's Muslim population.

Khalili said that the findings suggest that the increase

This is the first of a series of articles that I hope will shed light on the subject of 3d printing and the relationship it has with computing. I hope to be able to bring together a group of people, by offering some information and a calendar of workshops, to try and help people understand 3d printing.

Too often 3d printing is spoken about in terms of its ability to print objects for us. However, 3d printing is more than just a technology that allows us to print objects. It is a way of thinking about and understanding the world, and it is this way of thinking that is incredibly important. 3d printing is a way of thinking about and understanding the world that is much larger than the printer. It is the way that we understand the universe, and it is this way of understanding that is needed in order to make the technology of 3d printing work, and help us to reach our full potential in life.

In this article, I want to ask the question, "What is 3d printing?" and, "What is its relationship to computing?" I want to try and find out by writing about the history of 3d printing, and by looking at some of the technologies that have been developed as a result of this technology. I want to find out how 3d printing is changing the ways that we think about and understand the world around us, and I will try to highlight some of the key issues that the technology raises.

History of 3d printing

3d printing is one of the most exciting technologies that we have seen in recent times. It is an incredibly versatile method of making objects, and it is a way of making objects that we have never seen before. We know that 3d printing can print objects of any size, shape or material, but what we have not seen before are the applications that it has been able to create.

The first use of 3d printing was in the medical world. In the early 1900s, doctors who wanted to save a patient's life suggested that they start by printing a set of bones to be implanted in the patient. This idea was fairly simple, but it was something that every doctor in the world wanted to try, and it was a way of testing out if 3d printing would work as a medical device. However, by the late 1930s, the technology wasn't mature enough to be used in this way. This meant that the medical world had to start to innovate with new ways of using 3d printing.

These innovations were actually based on the idea that 3d printing could be used to create objects that would be useful for a range of different uses. To help in this process, a small team of scientists began to develop 3d printers that were specifically designed to manufacture metal parts. This was the beginning of a new trend in the development of medical 3d printing.

The first iterations of these were based on technology that was already at the time. These machines were much more complex, and they were used by a range of different industries. These machines were able to print metal parts, but they were not designed to print anything larger than a small punch-card.

Patterns, patterns, patterns

Medical technology has always been a focus of 3d printing. The medical world has always struggled to make sense of the world around us and to work out how to best treat people. From the relatively simple concept of treating the sick to the complex concept that we have of the human body, 3d printing has been a way of exploring the world around us.

One of the most striking examples of this is the use of 3d printed biopsies. 3d printed biopsies allow doctors to examine patients in the field, and see exactly what has been removed from their body. This is a huge problem in the medical world and has been a huge problem for generations of doctors. There are many different types of problems that are associated with the removal of large amounts of tissue from the body, and a common problem is that the tissue that has been removed is not as easily accessible to your doctor as the tissue that has been left.

This is why 3d printing has been such a great tool for medical research. It allows us to look at the human body in incredible detail, and it allows us to print out biopsies with a precision that is impossible in the real world. This has changed the way that doctors think about the body, and it has provided a real insight into how the human body works.

In the early 1970s, a team of scientists developed a way of printing new tissues that were much more readily accessible to the surgeons. This was created by the creation of a new type of bioprinting printer. This printer was so advanced, that it even allowed surgeons to see what lay underneath the skin of a patient. This was a breakthrough, and it was a way of stopping the many problems that doctors had with seeing what lay underneath the skin of a patient.

Genocide of Native Americans.

In 1884, the United States government signed a treaty with the Lakota Sioux Indians that allowed the government to seize the land of the Lakota, move them across the land into reservations, and destroy their way of life. The Lakota would not be allowed to go back to their homes and would be relocated to deal with a problem in the Dakota territory. This was a genocide.

And this is what the Republicans want to do to the non-white population.

They want to kill the welfare system. They want to kill the social safety net. They want to kill the minimum wage. And they want to kill any programs that help them.

What they're proposing is to cut the safety net. What they're proposing is to cut the minimum wage. What they're proposing is to cut Social Security.

And so they are advocating policies that would kill working families and would kill the economy.

They would also destroy unions. They would destroy collective bargaining. They would destroy Medicare and Medicaid. They would destroy food stamps. They would destroy unemployment insurance. And they will destroy the healthcare system. And they want to do it all at the federal level.

Want to help?

Here's the simple solution for these Republicans: Vote for the Green New Deal.

Where we would have a $15 minimum wage. Where we would have a $20 million a year investment in job training programs to get people back to work. Where we would have a $100 billion investment in infrastructure, green jobs, and renewable energy. A program that would create 6 million jobs and provide health care for all people. A program that would allow everyone in this country to be covered by Medicare and Medicaid. A program that would provide free college to all Americans. A program that would create millions of jobs for young people.

Let's give the Democrats a chance to win this election. Let's give them a chance to actually make a difference.

Let's make the Green New Deal the big issue of this election. It doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, a third party, or an independent. If you support the Green New Deal, you have to vote for Jill Stein.<|endoftext|>Borussia Dortmund captain Mats Hummels has confirmed his support for the UEFA president Michel Platini in his bid to reform football's governing body.

The German international, who helped his country win the 2014 World Cup, is part of a new generation of European football leaders who believe the current system is not working in Europe.

"I think that the UEFA president is a very good person and a very good man," Hummels told Bild. "I read his statement and I think he's right. The system is not working.

"We have to think about the football and the game and not just about money."

Platini, who has led UEFA for 11 years, has called for change in the body to make it more representative of the sport and to break down barriers between different countries.

"I believe the president of the European football association is a man who has a clear vision of the game and the sport," said Hummels. "He wants to be in charge of the sport.

"The president of the European association wants to make Europe stronger. I hope he will succeed."

Platini, who has previously said he would like to see an "open" system, said he could not be sure that his reforms would be successful but admitted that the problem with the current system was "very big".

"We have to make sure that we do not return to the past," he said. "The reform of the UEFA president is the most important reform in the history of European football."<|endoftext|>An Irish woman has been left "shocked and bewildered" after she was left stranded in Greece without her passport from her boyfriend.

Aston Villa have approached Manchester United about taking forward a deal for teenage winger Josh Onomah.

Villa are keen to strengthen their left-back position and manager Steve Bruce is looking for another option to partner England international Jordan Pickford.

Onomah, 18, is rated as one of England's brightest prospects by pundits and was on the fringes of the first-team squad until he suffered a broken leg in January.

Villa are also keen to strengthen their attacking options and have watched the youngster's first team debut against Southampton on Saturday.

It is thought the teenager is keen on a move to England and he has been a target for a number of Premier League clubs.

Onomah, who has impressed in pre-season, has been linked with Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool.

Villa are also hoping to keep hold of England Under-18 striker Jordan Houghton, who has been linked with a move to Fulham.<|endoftext|>The World of Darkness is a dangerous place.

In the early 1990s, the federal government, with the support of the states, began a massive land grab of nearly four million acres in Montana, Idaho, and Washington. On March 28, 1996, a coalition of indigenous and environmental groups, led by the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the federal government to stop the land grab. The lawsuit, which has been pending at the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., since then, is now being appealed.

The land grab was the largest in American history, and the largest ever undertaken by the U.S. government. The government, acting under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, proposed to remove approximately 60 million acres of protected wilderness, rangeland, and national forest in the United States. The plan also called for the removal of approximately 6.3 million acres of land owned by private corporations, including almost all of the remaining wilderness in those states except for some lands in Montana, Idaho, and Alaska.

Much of the land in those states was owned by federal agencies, and the federal government had been using that land to provide services, from firefighting to air quality monitoring to recreation. According to the argument advanced by the Forest Service in its defense, the Forest Service was entitled to use those lands on a temporary basis for conservation purposes or for other reasons. The plaintiffs, however, argued that the Forest Service was entitled to use all of the land it owned because the entire public domain was unprotected.

In 1992, the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had established the Western Forest Plan, which aimed to increase the amount of timber and other sustainable resources in the Western United States. In partnership with the Bureau of Land

In light of the recent developments in the original Phantom 4 aircraft incident, we are once again reviewing the Phantom 4's warranty and the implications that this new information presents. As many of you may have already read, the Phantom 4's warranty has been extended to 10 years. While the manufacturer's warranty for the original Phantom 4 has expired, it is important to note that the manufacturer has also extended the 10-year warranty to the refurbished version of the Phantom 4, which now includes a lifetime warranty.


While the Phantom 4's warranty has not changed, the language that was used in the original Phantom 4 warranty has been altered:


"The Phantom 4 is warranted for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase (the "Warranty Period"). The Phantom 4 is warranted against defects in materials and workmanship in the original equipment, as well as defects in the workmanship and materials during the Warranty Period. "Included with the Phantom 4 is a one-year limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship in the original equipment. This limited warranty does not apply when the Phantom 4 is resold, except that when the Phantom 4 is repaired, the repaired parts shall be replaced with new parts free of charge."


The original Phantom 4 warranty was for 9 years and contained a range of limitations, including the following limits:


"This warranty is void if the product has been serviced, repaired, altered or modified by anyone other than Phantom 4. This warranty also does not cover the Phantom 4 if it is in an accident or in the hands of a third party."


These limitations have been removed from the Phantom 4's warranty, however, the limitations remain in place for the refurbished version of the Phantom 4.


We are reviewing the Phantom 4's warranty to ensure that our customers are not subject to any additional limitations that may be added by the manufacturer. Should this be the case, we will be updating our Warranty Policy to incorporate the new language.<|endoftext|>The Great Depression came to an end in 1932 with the stock market crash, but the Depression itself continues to impact the lives of millions of Americans to this day. In fact, one of the most persistent myths about the Great Depression is that it was caused by the stock market crash.

It's true that the stock market declined by about 35% during the Great Depression. However, the stock market did not crash during the Great Depression.

In the first quarter of 1933, the stock market peaked at almost $100 billion. This was the peak of the stock market boom. The stock market reached its peak in May 1933 and fell rapidly thereafter. Within a few months, the stock market had fallen to $6.5 billion.

The Great Depression was a severe economic depression that affected millions of Americans. As a whole, it was a severe economic depression because the estimated loss of income was between $65 billion and $138 billion.

However, there is no evidence to support the notion that the stock market crash caused the Great Depression.

In fact, another large decline in the economy occurred in the first month of the Great Depression, and it was not caused by the stock market crash. On March 4, 1933, the U.S. economy started to contract again. The economy contracted by about 2% in the first month of the Great Depression.

In March 1933, the stock market peaked at $82 billion. The Great Depression had started in the first quarter of that year.

In the first quarter of 1933, the stock market had fallen by $20 billion. Yet, the economy continued to contract in the second quarter. In the second quarter of 1933, the economy contracted by $24 billion.

The Great Depression was not caused by the stock market crash.

Bottom Line

The stock market crash in 1929 caused the Great Depression. The Great Depression was caused by the economy's decline in the first quarter of 1933.<|endoftext|>OPINION: The Green Party has put the country on notice.

Every time the Greens win a seat or two in Parliament, the consensus view is that the party is going to go the way of the LNP and possibly the Democrats.

The pessimists say the Greens are becoming a party of the left. The optimists say the Greens are going to become a government-in-waiting.

But the Greens have been growing in popularity and influence for some time. And the fact that they're the best party to win a seat in Parliament is not a reason to get too excited.

The Greens have been able to obtain a foothold in Parliament because they have been able to take votes from the other parties.

I have supported the Greens for many years. This is what the Greens have been doing.

But I don't think the Greens have one of the best policies. For example, they don't have a policy to help people with their debts.

I also think the Greens are too ideologically driven.

I was in seventh grade and it had already been a couple of weeks since I'd spent four days in the hospital. I was going to be home soon, so I was worried about getting a headache. My parents had packed me off to stay with a friend for a week, and I was in a house with eight other kids. We had to come home one day a week to do homework or go to sports practice, and since I was still recovering from a concussion I stayed up late most nights, learning how to play soccer and basketball with my buddies.

I was in sixth grade, and my physical therapist had me do some light jogging to keep my legs limber, and I was really walking a lot. I played soccer and basketball with my friends, and in that time I started having regular headaches. One day, one of the best players in the neighborhood told me he thought I had a migraine. A migraine, only in the kind of stupid way that kids say things like "I have a headache." A couple of weeks later, I'd had a serious headache for a week. I was in a lot of pain, and I was really afraid of getting one. I was scared that I'd break my neck if I got a migraine, or that my family would be sad. I didn't want to get a headache.

I took a headache medicine every day and went to the headache specialist. She prescribed me a bunch of different kinds of painkillers, and I took them, but I never got a migraine. I was afraid of getting a migraine. I wasn't afraid. I was afraid for a reason.

I went to the doctor the next week, the one with the headache specialists, and he told me that the headaches were called migraine headaches and that they were really common. He told me that when you get a migraine, you're just in the way. You're in the way of getting that dessert, or that drink, or that job interview. You're not really there, so you're not really in the way to distract yourself. You're just in the way of the big, bad headache that's going to hit you in the face. So what if you've never had one? It doesn't mean you won't. There are all kinds of reasons why someone might not get a migraine.

The doctor went on to tell me that my headache was probably related to my not having had a lot of sex in the last few months, and that I needed to start having sex again. I was like, "I don't have any problems with sex. I'm not attracted to anyone." But that's what they told me. They took my pulse and my blood pressure and told me that I was having a stress headache. I didn't know what that meant, so I asked them to describe it to me. They said, "A stress headache is when your heart races and you're stressed out." I was like, "Thanks, I didn't know that." I went to my mom's house that night and had a conversation with her about how I was having a stress headache, and she was like, "Yeah, your heart's racing, and your eyes are tearing, and everything's a little bit blurry. But it's just kind of a headache, it's no big deal, it's not going to kill you." But it was.

When I got home that night, I told my parents. I told my mom that I was having a stress headache. She went into a panic. She went to the doctor. She was like, "Oh, you're having a stress headache, honey. Don't worry about it." I don't know what happened that night. Maybe my mom was just not trained in the proper way to deal with stress, but she was like, "It's just a stress headache, honey. Don't worry about

The following is an excerpt from a piece that Will Manso wrote for the Toronto Star about his successful attempt to defend the Constitution of the United States against the legal challenges brought by the Obama administration. Manso is a lawyer who has written extensively and widely about the Constitution and its Article III of the Constitution. This is an excerpt from a longer article that will appear in the Star.

I remember when the Obama administration first filed its lawsuit against the Senate on June 27, 2013, I was watching the news from work, and I heard the news machine suddenly buzzing. I was waiting for a phone call from my lawyer, who told me I had to get to my office right away.

I knew the president was going to vigorously defend the Constitution, and I knew I had to be prepared for the fight. My lawyer told me not to worry. His view was that Obama is "not from the left," and as such he would never bring the Constitution into the court.

I was wrong.

I was wrong to think that Obama was not from the left, or that he would ever bring the Constitution into the court.

The president has begun a crusade to redefine the Constitution. He has brought with him over 300 lawyers from the Justice Department, the CIA, and the Pentagon, and he wants to rewrite the Constitution to suit his agenda. They are going after the Bill of Rights and the Judicial Branch, including the Supreme Court. They are arguing that Congress has no oversight of the executive branch, the U.S. military, or the NSA. They are arguing that the Constitution is not a fixed document, but rather, a living document that evolves as the American people change.

The president has brought with him over 300 lawyers from the Justice Department, the CIA, and the Pentagon, and he wants to rewrite the Constitution to suit his agenda.

I am one of those Americans who believes the Constitution is a living document. Our founders were mindful of the fact that the Constitution evolves as times and circumstances change, and they thought its words should be interpreted to reflect the times as they were understood.

In my opinion, the president is attempting to rewrite the Constitution in order to expand the power of the executive branch and the military by rewriting its very definition. Obama has stated that he is not interested in "litigating the issues."

The president has made threats about prosecuting individuals who disagree with his agenda. He has threatened individuals who refuse to sign "tacit consent" for warrantless searches. He has threatened whistleblowers. He has threatened the first amendment. He has threatened the separation of powers. He has threatened the separation of church and state.

In the midst of the ongoing shakeup of the GOP, there are a few candidates who are keeping their powder dry. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is one of them.

The 2016 presidential contender has no campaign for the time being, and the South Carolina senator has not yet announced his official entry into the race.

But Graham, who was considered a possible vice presidential candidate for GOP front-runner Donald Trump, is still keeping the process of his presidential bid under wraps.

"I've had many discussions with people about this," Graham told ABC News. "There have been some interesting conversations being had, but I am not making any announcements at this point."

Graham made headlines in August when he suggested the Senate should reject Trump's proposed Muslim ban.

"If you're not willing to ban people based on something as arbitrary as religion, then what are you willing to do other than ban people based on their nationalities?" Graham told CNN at the time.

But Graham stopped short of saying his endorsement of Trump would be a first step to running for president.

"I have no idea," he said. "I haven't talked to Donald Trump about it. I haven't talked to his people about it. But I can tell you I would not be in the race."

Graham's absence from the race also means one of the most widely reported names in the GOP primary field, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, doesn't have a campaign either.

Cruz's campaign manager Jeff Roe told ABC News the senator is not running for president.

"Ted has been focused on electing conservatives to the Senate and he will continue to do that in the coming months," Roe said. "He has no plans for a presidential campaign in the near future."

The campaign is being run by Davis, a former Cruz communications director.

Cruz's absence from the campaign trail has not stopped his campaign from making news outside of South Carolina.

Cruz has moved to increase his national profile by holding a series of listening sessions in New Hampshire and Iowa, where he delivered his second-ever speech.

He also held a town hall in New York City with Rochester, N.H., police chief William Shatner, who was the guest speaker at the event.

The Texas senator's campaign has also been accused of being secretive, and the Texas Tribune reports Cruz did not disclose whose campaign was paying for his travel expenses when he went to Iowa earlier this month.

The Tribune also reported that Cruz's campaign had paid for the travel of Iowa state Sen. Kent Sorenson, a Cruz supporter, to a fundraiser in South Carolina.

Cruz's allies have denied the allegations.

"The issue is that you can't have a campaign that is completely transparent," Roe said. "I understand that. We all understand that."

Roe also said that Cruz's days of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire are over.

"All of those things are over now," Roe said. "He's going to start spending this summer working in states that are more like the general election, in states that are more competitive."

But it doesn't mean Cruz is done in the 2016 race. He is scheduled to speak at a fundraiser in Washington, D.C., on Thursday night.

Graham said his campaign is still in the early planning stages, but he is currently focused on the upcoming state primaries in South Carolina and Nevada.<|endoftext|>A white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, has cast a spotlight on the city's plans to expand its transportation options, including a new streetcar line that will run from the University of Virginia campus to downtown.

Streetcars have proven to be a popular form of public transportation in the U.S., with roughly 11,000 in operation in the U.S. and Canada.

Vendor Hutchings & Co. is the lead contractor on the $15 million project, which will build a new streetcar line that will run from the UVA campus to downtown Charlottesville.

The line, which will connect to the existing 10-mile line that runs from UVA to downtown, will be the first of its kind in the state of Virginia, as the state's new transportation legislation requires that 10 percent of new highway construction will allow for the installation of streetcars.

"We're very excited to be working with the City of Charlottesville to bring this new streetcar to the city. It's a great addition to our downtown corridor," said Mary Anne Lane, a spokesperson for Hutchings & Co.

The company's general manager, Michael Hutchinson, said he and his team are looking forward to an "exciting time" as the new line is under construction, and will continue to do so through the end of 2018.

"It's exciting to be joining the many partners who are helping make this project a reality," said Hutchinson.

The streetcar is being built by the city of Charlottesville under

Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Education, at her confirmation hearing on Jan. 17. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)

The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday upheld a district court decision to allow the Republican-controlled Senate to vote on President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for education secretary.

The court rejected the Obama Administration's contention that the Senate had exceeded its authority when it failed to hold a hearing on Betsy DeVos, a billionaire Republican activist and Michigan billionaire who once chaired the state's Republican Party.

"We conclude that the [Senate's] failure to hold a hearing on Senator DeVos's nomination violated the separation of powers doctrine," Chief Judge Merrick Garland wrote for the three-judge panel.

The Senate, in a 52-48 vote, voted on Jan. 17 to confirm DeVos, a billionaire Republican activist and Michigan billionaire who once chaired the state's Republican Party, as education secretary.

The vote was the first time the Senate has used its discretion to approve a cabinet nominee, and it was a blow to the Obama Administration, which had argued that the Senate had exceeded its authority by failing to hold a hearing on DeVos.

Garland had rejected the Obama Administration's argument that the Senate had exceeded its authority by failing to hold a hearing on DeVos. Garland wrote that the Obama Administration had "unduly narrowed the scope of the 'power of the purse,'" which the Constitution assigns to the Senate.

"The right to make a nomination by the Senate is a 'fundamental' one, and the Judiciary is entrusted with the power to 'check and balance,' not to 'promulgate a single legislative agenda,' " Garland wrote.

"The Senate has not only the authority to consider the nomination itself, but also the power to determine whether to conduct an up-or-down confirmation hearing," Garland added. "Ensuring that the Senate's power of the purse is respected is a matter of 'constitutional protocol,'" he wrote.

Garland's decision will have little practical effect. DeVos, who has not yet been confirmed by the Senate, will retain her seat on the Education Committee, where she was slated to testify on Tuesday.

It will also mean that the Senate will have to take up DeVos's nomination again, with the same half-dozen senators who are not on the education committee.

In a two-page order, Garland also rejected the Obama Administration's argument that the Senate had exceeded its authority by failing to hold a hearing on Oklahoma Education Secretary Betsy Devos.

The Obama Administration had argued that the Senate had exceeded its authority when it failed to hold a hearing on Devos.

The case centers on the Education Department's 2015 Rule 1552 that was intended to help states meet federal Title IX obligations in the context of Title IX investigations for sexual harassment and assault.

As a result, DeVos, who is now the head of the federal Department of Education, was formally blocked from taking office.

In Friday's decision, Garland said that the Education Department had not violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to put out a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the rule.

Garland wrote that Congress had specifically granted the Office of Management and Budget the authority to make the temporary rule. "The burden of proof is on OMB to show that the proposed rule is necessary and proper, not on the Office to show that it is not," Garland wrote.

Garland also rejected the Obama Administration's argument that the Senate had exceeded its authority by failing to hold a hearing on Devos.

Garland wrote that the Senate had not exceeded its authority when it failed to hold a hearing on Devos.

"We conclude that the Senate's failure to hold a hearing on Senator Devos's nomination violated the separation of powers doctrine," Garland wrote.

"The Senate has the power to confirm or reject a nominee for any position in the executive branch of the federal government," he continued. "The Senate's power to confirm a nominee is 'one of the most important and delicate powers conferred by the Constitution,' and 'the Senate has the sole responsibility to decide whether to confirm or reject the nomination of a federal officer or employee,' " he wrote.

======================================== SAMPLE 102 ========================================
As I mentioned earlier today, I have a bit of an obsession with the headless horseman, and as a consequence, the other two variants are not a top priority for my blog. However, the three-headed horseman was satisfyingly epic, so I thought I'd give the archetype the full treatment.

First, a little background: the three-headed horseman was one of the three main archetypes which appeared in the earliest editions of the White Wolf published material. This was followed by the three-headed beastman, and then finally the three-headed knight. The three-headed horseman appeared in the first edition of the White Wolf novel "The Dragon of the North", and it was the protagonist's role to overcome the three-headed beastman by defeating the animal and bringing it to heel. The three-headed horseman was popular enough that the archetype was re-introduced in the second half of the first edition of the White Wolf novel "The World of Darkness" (the first half of the book was written by Gary Gygax himself).

The three-headed horseman was one of the first three-headed monster archetypes to be introduced into the game, and was in fact one of the first monsters to be offered as an option for players to choose. It is a very powerful monster archetype which is very difficult to kill, and as a result, it is often included in games which have players aiming to kill every monster. There was nothing like it in the original edition of the game, however, so the concept of the three-headed horseman was not well-accepted. The three-headed beastman was introduced a few years later, and was a lot more popular in its time, so it was the primary archetype which was offered as a choice to choose.

The three-headed horseman has become a very popular archetype, and the popularity of this monster has only grown in the last few years. One of the reasons is that the three-headed horseman is an excellent character for a GM to have at his disposal, and it offers a host of benefits to the player. The first and most obvious benefit is that the three-headed horseman is essentially a three-headed monster, which means that it can be used to power a paragon of the appropriate alignment. That is, the three-headed horseman has the full complement of abilities and skills of a four-headed monster, plus the ability to harness its three heads. This is one of the most powerful archetypes which can be used in a campaign, and it offers a great deal of flexibility.

The second obvious benefit of being a three-headed monster is that it allows the player to take on the appearance of a three-headed monster. As we discussed yesterday, this allows the player to use his supernatural prowess to transform into a three-headed monster, which is a powerful fantasy-based ability. The third obvious benefit of the tri-headed monster is that it allows the player to have a lot of options for using its abilities. For example, it can take the form of a sword, a hammer, or a spear, which allows for a great deal of versatility in how it can be used. Therefore, the three-headed horseman can be used in many ways, from the classic role-playing game (as a two-headed monster which fights with a sword and a hammer, and transforms into a three-headed monster when in the form of a spear) to a completely different game (a game where the player can transform into a three-headed monster by using a spell which turns him into a horse).

Now, a big part of the reason why the three-headed horseman has become so popular is because it is a powerful monster. Like all monsters, it is a fantastic monster which can be used in many different ways. However, the third obvious reason why the three-headed horseman is so popular is that it is a very powerful monster, and thus it is very difficult to kill. This is a very important aspect of the archetype, because as the name implies, the three-headed monster is a three-headed monster, which means that it is easy to kill. The first and most obvious way that it is easy to kill is by transforming into a three-headed monster, and if the GM is using the three-headed horseman, then it is easy to kill by just transforming into a three-headed monster. The second obvious way that it is easy to kill is by using the three heads to strike at the enemy. The third obvious way that it is easy to kill is by using the three heads to do something else.

This is a very powerful archetype, but it is also a very powerful monster. It is difficult to use, but it is easy to kill, and it is very hard to defeat. Thus, it is recommended that players use the three-headed horseman as a character, and to be used as a champion of their alignment. The third head of

Texas A&M won 33-14. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) (Photo: The Associated Press)

University of Texas officials said Friday that they would look into a video showing a student-athlete being physically shoved by a group of Aggie fans after Saturday's game.

"We are aware of the video and are initiating an investigation," Texas A&M spokesman John Bianco said. "We will not comment further at this time."

Two members of the Aggie football coaching staff were in the crowd at Kyle Field that night and also witnessed the incident, Bianco said.

The video, which shows part of the stadium's south end zone, shows a group of fans surround a Texas A&M student-athlete. The student-athlete is talking to fans as he holds the hands of two women.

During the video, a man in a red jersey appears to shove the student-athlete.

A group of Aggie fans can be heard yelling "get out of the way" and "get out of here."

A Texas A&M spokesman said the Aggie football staff was not involved in the incident and did not witness the attack.

A source told The San Antonio Express-News that the Aggies' assistant coaches were in the crowd when the incident occurred, although the football staff felt threatened.

The university's student-athletes said Saturday they were disappointed by the video with the hashtag "#boysagainstboys."

The Aggies defeated Texas A&M in a 31-14 victory to remain undefeated.

SEATTLE -- A man who was bitten by a rabid raccoon in the U-District was bitten by a different type of raccoon Thursday morning, Seattle Police say.


The bite happened around 9 a.m. at 2nd Avenue and S. Jackson Street.


The man was bitten on the leg and was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.


The raccoon was removed from the man's leg and it was euthanized Thursday afternoon.


Police say the raccoon was off its food supply, which is typical for a rabid animal.


The raccoon is not believed to be the same raccoon that bit the man.


Rabies is a viral disease of mammals that causes the body's immune system to attack and destroy the nervous system. The symptoms can be severe and include fever, muscle weakness, headache, vomiting and diarrhea.<|endoftext|>The week that was for the New York Rangers, as they went 3-1-0 as they honored their former coach.

The New York Rangers hit the ice for the first time in a few weeks last Tuesday, and the players and coaches were excited.

It had been a long two months, as they had gone through the relocation process, and the team was at least in good shape now.

The Rangers had won two games in a row, and they were in control of their own destiny.

But then, something happened.

A rather significant moment, to the point where if it weren't for the fact that it occurred so shortly after the Islanders' 100-year anniversary, it would have gone completely unnoticed.

As the Los Angeles Lakers prepare to play the Golden State Warriors, four NBA writers (including me) are trying to decide which player is the best.

We'll be running our series of "Best Of" lists throughout the season, and, as our readers are probably aware, the Warriors and Lakers are both in the mix.

We've taken different approaches to this project. Some of us will rank each player on a point-for-point basis, ranking each player according to how well they've played this season. Other writers will rank each player in percentage terms.

And there's an even more controversial approach.

Some of us will rank each player based on how well we think he'll fair in the faceoff circle. And some of us will rank each player based on how well we think he'll do in the end-of-game scenarios, too.

We know that the Warriors and Lakers are both heavy favorites to win their respective conference finals this season; both teams are playing for the title and have a great chance to advance to the NBA Finals.

And there's the chance that the Lakers will fall to the Warriors in the West finals. If that happens, the Warriors could win the championship.

But what happens if the Lakers lose in the conference finals? Would they be able to win the NBA Championship, or would they have to face the Warriors in the Finals again?

What if the Lakers lose the West finals?

It's not a hypothetical question. In fact, we have already seen the scenario play out.

The Los Angeles Lakers lost to the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference semifinals, and then they lost to the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference finals. In between those two losses, the Lakers went on a tear, winning games at a surprising rate.

The team went on a tear in the Western Conference finals, but the Rockets eventually won it all. How will the Lakers fare in the NBA Finals if they lose the West finals?

The Lakers are going to have to play spoiler, if they want to win the NBA title this season.

If the Lakers lose the West finals, they'll face the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals. If they lose the West finals, they'll face the Houston Rockets in the NBA Finals.

I'm going to rank the players in this way based on how well I think they'll do in the end-of-game scenarios. I'll also be ranking them based on how well they'll do in the end-of-game scenarios, but I'll be doing it in percentage terms.

That way, you can read a player's ranking in a column and still know how good he is at winning games.

The Lakers' season is going to be a difficult one. Will they be able to win multiple championships, or will they just be breaking new ground?

We'll be running our series of Best Of lists through the entire season. So keep checking back to find out how we rank the Lakers.<|endoftext|>A new study has found that women who have multiple partners are more likely to have multiple abortions than women who do not.

The study, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, examined data from the Canadian Community Health Survey and found that women who had 10 or more pregnancies were more likely to have abortions than women who had fewer than one pregnancy.

This finding isn't surprising to many, but the authors of the study note that it's the first to show that multiple pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of abortion.

"This is the first study to show that multiple pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of abortion," Dr. Alyssa Shumer of the University of Toronto, the study's lead author, told Reuters.

"It's an important finding because it suggests that women who are trying to avoid an unwanted pregnancy should avoid multiple pregnancies, and that women who are trying to have a baby should wait until they are ready to be pregnant to have a baby."

The study found that the risk of abortion increased for women who had more than two pregnancies, but the risk of abortion was the same regardless of how many pregnancies women had or how many abortions they had.

The researchers theorize that situations in which women are trying to get pregnant but don't know they are pregnant may increase the risk of abortion, while situations in which women know they are pregnant but choose to avoid pregnancy could increase the risk of abortion.

This isn't the first study to find that multiple pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of abortion.

In 2009, the American Journal of Public Health published a study that found that women who had multiple pregnancies were more likely to have an abortion than women who had one pregnancy.

The study, which reviewed the results of the National Survey of Family Growth and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, found that women who had multiple pregnancies were more likely to have had abortions than women who had one pregnancy. However,

The number of American troops in Afghanistan will be reduced from 9,800 to 5,500 by the end of this year, with the remainder to be cut by August 2018, the Pentagon announced Wednesday.

The operational and training mission in Afghanistan will be spread among 3,000 to 5,500 U.S. troops, with about 3,000 of those troops being deployed to advise and assist Afghan forces. The remaining troops will focus on supporting counterterrorism operations, military operations and peacekeeping missions.

The U.S. currently has about 8,400 service members in Afghanistan, and the U.S. will withdraw all of its troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016.

The decision to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan was largely driven by the success of the Afghan National Army and the ability of the Afghan government to provide security in the country.

"Over the past year, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces have proven themselves to be a reliable, capable partner that can take the lead in the fight against terrorism," Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in the Pentagon press release.

"And our Afghan partners have learned the value of working with us to build the Afghan security forces, to prioritize the protection of Afghan civilians, and to forge a lasting peace that provides the Afghan people with the security they deserve."

The U.S. military contribution to the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan will also be reduced from 9,800 to 5,500, as a result of the new strategy.

The number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, however, will not be reduced drastically, Carter said.

The remaining American troops would have to rotate into Afghanistan as the military prepared for the withdrawal of its forces.

The number of troops in Afghanistan during the first half of this year is expected to be about 5,500, with the number of American troops in the country declining by about 1,000 by the end of the year.

Carter said the U.S. would continue to support the Afghan government as it takes the lead in building the security forces and building a democracy.

"For the Afghan people, the United States will remain their steadfast partner in the fight against terrorism," Carter said.

"For the Afghan people, we will remain their most steadfast ally in the fight against corruption in their country. And for the Afghan people, we will remain their steadfast defender as they take the long and difficult road toward a sovereign and stable Afghanistan."

The Pentagon also announced Wednesday that the U.S. military will deploy a military adviser to Afghanistan until Aug. 1, 2016.

The adviser will help train Afghan forces to take the lead in the fight against terrorism, and will be rotated into the country as needed. The adviser will be based in Kabul, but will also deploy to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan and Kandahar Air Field in Afghanistan, where the U.S. military currently has a military air base.

"The close partnership we have built with the Afghan government will continue to thrive, as we continue to train and advise their national security forces, and build on the progress already made," the Pentagon press release said.

The senior U.S. civilian and military leadership has been working to determine the best way to reduce the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan.

The United States is currently the world's largest contributor to the war in Afghanistan. In October, the Pentagon announced it would reduce troop levels to 8,400 by the end of 2016.

The United States has about 8,000 troops in Afghanistan, and plans to withdraw all of its troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016.<|endoftext|>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new, oral contraceptive called Essure, which delivers the same hormones found in intrauterine devices, in a landmark decision that could affect millions of women.

The FDA voted 5-0 on Thursday to approve Essure, which is now the first pregnancy prevention product to be marketed by the agency. The agency said it is considering new applications for other intrauterine devices, including the one used by Essure.

"It's a big step forward in preventing unintended pregnancies," said Dr. Mary Gatter, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health and an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. "More women will now have the option to prevent unwanted pregnancies."

The FDA approved Essure, which uses a tiny metal clip to puncture the uterus, based on a scientific review that found it to be as effective as the long-acting implant commonly used to prevent pregnancy.

[JURIST] A federal appeals court [official website] on Friday ruled [opinion, PDF] against the US Department of Justice (DoJ) [official website] in a lawsuit [opinion, PDF] filed by more than 3,000 people who were denied the ability to obtain a concealed carry permit by the state of California. The appeals court found the DoJ's actions violated the Second Amendment [text] and Second Amendment right to bear arms. In doing so, the appeals court found that the state of California had to allow people that had been denied concealed carry permits to petition for a concealed carry license, which would allow them to carry concealed firearms in public. The court noted that in recent years, the number of permit denials had been on the decline. The court also found that the DoJ had failed to prove that citizens who were denied a permit were actually a danger to themselves or others. The appeals court ruled that the regulations were too vague and that the administration of California's concealed carry permit laws was insufficiently transparent to allow people to understand the law.

The US Supreme Court in 2008 upheld [JURIST report] the right for people to carry a concealed firearm in public. In 2010, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled [JURIST report] that citizens have a right to carry a concealed firearm in public. In 2011, the California Court of Appeals ruled [JURIST report] that a citizen can carry a concealed firearm in public under circumstances that are permitted under state law. In 2012, the US Supreme Court declined to review the Ninth Circuit's decision. In 2014, a federal district court ruled [JURIST report] that the government must grant a permit to anyone who applies for one.<|endoftext|>Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics.

Is there a cure for diabetes? Answer From Jon O. Williams, M.D.

Yes, there is. The most effective way to cure diabetes is to control your blood sugar. The best way to do that is to control your insulin and your blood sugar.

Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use sugar from the food you eat as fuel. Insulin is different from other hormones in that it does not stimulate the development of cells and tissue. Instead, insulin helps to move blood sugar into cells. As long as your body has insulin, your cells can take in food and convert it to energy.

Insulin also helps to move blood sugar out of cells and into the blood. As long as the blood sugar level in your blood is under control, insulin does not have to do that work.

When your blood sugar is out of control, insulin cannot move blood sugar into cells, and your body does not take in as much glucose. If your blood sugar is very low, you may experience a spike in blood sugar. If this happens, you may feel thirsty, have a rapid heartbeat, and feel tired. Along with a fast heartbeat, these symptoms can be a sign that your blood sugar is out of control.

If you have had a low-sugar diet and are still experiencing low blood sugar, your doctor may recommend that you take insulin to control your blood sugar. Insulin should be given every three hours during the day, and twice each day in the evening. It should be used as soon as you have a low blood sugar level, and for several days after you have a low blood sugar level. Your doctor may also recommend that you take insulin when you have a meal or snack.

If you are currently taking insulin, you may want to try to gradually shift from taking insulin to a lower dose with a test meal. It may take a few weeks for your body to replace the insulin you have been taking. If you are on insulin, do not stop taking it without consulting your doctor.<|endoftext|>The Department of State today announced that it will designate Oxfam America as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under Executive Order 13224, which was signed by President George W. Bush on September 20, 2001. The designation designates the organization as a FTO under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and designates all of its officers and employees as FTOs.

The National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA) has reviewed the designations and believes that the designations are appropriate given Oxfam America's and its affiliates' activities that threaten the national security of the United States. Oxfam America has engaged in a long-term and broad campaign to undermine the democratic institutions of the United States, including the release of secret documents that exposed fraud and corruption in the 2004 presidential election, and the promotion of a one-sided agenda that seeks to undermine the United States' ability to develop and maintain allies and trade relationships around the world. This includes illegal activities in the United States, including the proliferation of IFID, influence operations, and funding to political parties, candidates, and other groups in the United States.

The presidential election is more than two months away, but with absentee ballots arriving in most states, it's already clear the campaigns are taking a page out of the playbook of the US presidential race four years ago.

Since then, President Barack Obama has made a point of campaigning in swing states, while Mitt Romney has focused heavily on his home state of Michigan.

Both sides are hoping their supporters will vote early and without fear of being disenfranchised by the government.

In the US, absentee ballots are the best way to avoid being forced to cast a provisional ballot.

The Obama campaign has been particularly aggressive in this regard, offering financial incentives for people to get their votes in early.

The Democratic presidential hopeful has also made an effort to reach out to young people, encouraging them to vote early with a series of events across the country.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Obama has made a point of campaigning in swing states

The Romney campaign has also been more aggressive in the early voting process, encouraging supporters to vote early by sending them mail-in ballots.

"We've been very aggressive in terms of it being a priority for us," says Jennifer Duffy, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign.

"Our campaign is focused on making sure people vote early so they can have their voices heard in this election. And we're confident that our supporters will have the same result."

The Obama campaign says it is focused on getting voters to the polls on 8 November.

"We want to make sure it's easy to vote and we want to make sure that the votes that are cast are counted, that the votes are counted fairly," Ms Duffy says.

The US presidential election is the most closely watched in the world.

Every vote counts. But can a high turnout make a difference?

The US election system is very different from that in the UK, Canada and Australia, where all citizens have the right to vote.

In the US, all citizens are entitled to vote - but only some can vote at a given time.

The government says this is done to prevent an election from being "stolen" by a small number of people who can easily influence the outcome.

Since there are only a few days between the election and the inauguration, the campaigns have been focused on getting their supporters to the ballot box.

So far, both sides have been successful, although there is still much work to do.

But even if there is a close race, the outcome could still be decided by a small number of votes in a handful of swing states.

In the UK, the most recent election in 2007 was decided by less than 3,000 votes in the Conservatives' win of the Witney by-election.

In Canada in 2011, the election of Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff was decided by a few hundred votes in Montreal.

And in Australia, the latest election in 2013 was not decided by a single seat in the Senate.

But there is one thing that has become clear in the US election: it's less important than in other countries whether the votes are counted correctly.

"It's a little bit easier to influence the outcome of an election if the votes are counted by hand," says Neil Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Texas, Austin.

"I think the pressure that a little bit of missing votes puts on the election officials is something that is very, very hard to overcome."

How do you vote?

For the most part, people can vote in person at their local polling station or by mail.

The number of registered voters in the US has grown dramatically in recent years and has now topped 250 million, according to the US Census Bureau.

While in many countries, such as Britain, the polls close at 8pm, in the United States the US Election Commission says the polls must close at 7pm, and the counting of votes continues for a further four hours.

And while in the UK, most postal votes are counted and counted by hand, in the US many are counted by optical scanners.

The votes are then sorted by the numbers on the ballot papers.

But in the UK, a referendum on introducing same-sex marriage was held in 2013. In the US, the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry.

If the US election were held today, would the outcome be the same?

The video is called "The Price of the Peace" and it is an emotional and powerful account of the war in Lebanon in 2006.

The video, and the video below, were both created and posted by an Israeli combat veteran named Elad Peled, who served in the Israeli Defence Forces for 20 years.

The video shows a man who was a member of the Israel Defence Force in Lebanon in 2006. He was injured and tortured by Hezbollah. He was awarded the Israeli Medal of Honours by the Israeli government in 2005, but it was revoked in 2009 because he was found to have committed war crimes.

In the video he describes how he was tortured (see below) and how Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah was responsible.

The video below shows two people beating and torturing a man, who appears to be a former IDF soldier.

The video below is also from 2006 and shows how the IDF tortured captured Hezbollah soldiers.

Elad Peled has received many awards for his courageous reporting on human rights violations in Lebanon, including the prestigious prestigious Israel Prize, the Israel Prize for International Reporting, the Israel Prize for Journalism, the Israel Prize for Social Responsibility, and the Israel Prize for Human Rights.

Elad Peled's story is very similar to that of another Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit. Gilad Shalit was captured in 2006 by Hamas and was held in Gaza for five years. He was released in 2011 and his family settled back in Israel. Gilad Shalit, like Elad Peled, was tortured by Hezbollah during his captivity.

In a statement to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Peled said "I received a phone call recently from a man who was a former member of the IDF, a soldier of the army and a captain. He explained how he and his comrades were tortured by Hezbollah during the war in Lebanon and how their commanders collaborated with them. He did not know me, but he gave me his phone number and told me to contact him. He spoke in the language I understand very well: Arabic. I called him and we talked about the torture and the situation in Lebanon. He said that he and his comrades were captured in 2006 by Hamas and that they were tortured by Hezbollah and its commanders. He also told me that he had received a medal from the Israeli government for his bravery. He said that he received the medal for his bravery in fighting in the Gaza Strip. He was held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and he was tortured by Hamas and Hezbollah. He was tortured every day for five years. He was detained in the same prison he was held in during the war in Lebanon. He told me that he was tortured by Hamas and Hezbollah. He also told me that he was detained by the IDF and that he was tortured in the IDF prison in the Hebron area. He said that he was tortured by the IDF in the same prison that he was held in during the war in Lebanon. He said that his interrogators were members of the Shin Bet and that he was interrogated at the same interrogation center that he was held in during the war in Lebanon. He said that his interrogators were much more brutal than the interrogators in the IDF. He said that when he was interrogated, he was beaten every day and he was interrogated until he was sick. He said that his interrogators were very cruel. He said that he told the interrogators that he was a journalist and that he was writing a book about his experiences in the IDF, but that he was beaten all the time. The interrogators did not let him sleep and they did not treat him well. He told me that he was beaten every day, and he was missing 6 or 7 teeth. He said that he was tortured with electric shocks, sleep deprivation, and the use of marijuana. He said that his interrogators were extremely cruel. He said that he was interrogated three times. The first time, he was held for 12 hours and interrogated for 3 hours, and the second time he was interrogated for 5 hours and interrogated for 6 hours. He said that he was asked to confess that he was a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and that he was fighting against the Lebanese Army. He said that he refused to confess and was beaten. He said that he refused to confess and was tortured. He

This is the first of a series of articles about making a game, the second part will be about the architecture of your game, the third will be about the gameplay of your game.

In the first part of this article you will understand how to create a simple game, which you can run from your IDE or even on your Raspberry Pi. In the second part of this series you will start to make your game, and you will learn how to use the GUI, to create levels, to manipulate objects.

In this article we will create a simple game, using OpenGL.

We will start by creating a game object and setting its properties:

// create a GameObject with a default configuration glfwSetBuffered(GLFW_BUFFER_BIT, 1); glfwSetFramebuffer(GLFW_FRAMEBUFFER, glfwGetFramebufferSize(GLFW_FRAMEBUFFER_BIT)); glfwSetWindowTitle(GLFW_WINDOW_TITLE); glfwSetWindowResource(GLFW_TEXTURE_2D, GLFW_TEXTURE_2D); glfwSetWindowSize(GLFW_WINDOW_SIZE, glfwGetWindowSize(GLFW_WINDOW_BIT)); glfwSetWindowFace(GLFW_WINDOW_FACING, glfwGetWindowFacing(GLFW_WINDOW_FACING)); // create a texture glfwCreateTexture(GLFW_TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, sizeof(GLFW_TEXTURE_2D), NULL, NULL); // draw a rectangle glfwDrawRect(GLFW_COLOR, 0, 0, 320, 320);

In the above code we create a new OpenGL context and then pass the GLFW_BUFFER_BIT to set a bit in the buffer in the GLFW_BUFFER_BIT variable. The first thing we do is to set a bit in the GLFW_BUFFER_BIT variable. This enables us to work with GLFW's buffer objects, which have a bitwise access to the size of the buffer in bytes.

Next we set the size of the GLFW_TEXTURE_2D variable (which is a pointer to a struct containing the texture). The size of the GLFW_TEXTURE_2D variable is a power of 2, so we need to multiply the size of the texture in bytes by 2.

Finally we draw a rectangle.

We now understand how to create a GLFW context, and how to set some of the parameters of the OpenGL context.

The next thing we need is a texture object. Since we are using OpenGL we need to create a texture object. To create a texture object we use the following code:

// create a texture object glfwCreateTexture(GLFW_TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, sizeof(GLFW_TEXTURE_2D), NULL, NULL); glfwSetTexture(GLFW_TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, glfwGetTextureParameter(GLFW_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINARY, &texture_data, NULL, NULL);

We first initialize the texture object to be the first parameter of the glfwCreateTexture() function. Next we load the texture object using glfwGetTextureParameter() and pass the variable texture_data to the glfwSetTexture() function.

We then create a texture object by passing the texture_data variable to glfwSetTexture().

Note that you need to pass the texture_data variable to glfwCreateTexture() function, otherwise the context will not be created.

In the above code we set the texture object using glfwSetTexture().

Now we can draw the rectangle with a texture object.

We now know how to create a GLFW context, and how to draw a rectangle using texture objects.

The next thing we need is a game loop.

The game loop is where the game logic of your game resides.

The game loop will be called from a main() function, and it will run when the game is running.

In the game loop we will do the following:

Let's start by creating a new game object:

// create a new game object glfwSetBuffered(GLFW_BUFFER_BIT, 1); // set the width and height of the game object glfwSetWindowTitle(GLFW_WINDOW_TITLE); // set the window title glfwSetWindowResource(GLFW_TEXTURE_2D, GLFW_TEXTURE_2D); // create the game object glfwCreateGame(); // create the window glfwSetWindowResource(GLFW_WINDOW_RESIZE, GLFW_WINDOW_RESIZE); // create a window glfwSetWindowTitle(GLFW_WINDOW_TITLE, "Simple Game"); // set the

The long journey to the state of New York

4 years ago

Last weekend was a busy one for me, as I was in the middle of a 2 week road trip from New Jersey to New York City. I was trying to learn how to cure myself of a bum ankle, but I couldn't find any good information on the internet. I ended up getting a lot of flack on the internet for not being able to cure my ankle, but at the same time I'm not really sure how to cure my problem or explain it to others.


I didn't have much to do on the road, because I was sleeping in my car. I arrived at the airport early Sunday morning, and went straight to the airport to pick up my flight. On my way to the airport, I stopped at a McDonald's and bought a large pack of "chips and fries" (I don't remember the name of the place, but I'm pretty sure it's from the mid-west) and sat down to eat. I was planning on doing a lot of walking around, but I got very sick and hungry. I didn't have time to wait for my flight, so I went back to my hotel room and laid down on my bed. At that point in the day, I decided that I would have to get up and walk. I didn't have a map, and I was totally lost. I had no idea where to go or where I would be going next. I could only see the hotels and the airport, but I couldn't figure out how to get there. I decided I would have to walk around New York City until I got up to the hotel.

I had forgotten how many people live in New York City. I was walking around the streets and looking at the buildings, when I saw a bus stop. I walked over to the bus stop and started walking towards it. I'm not sure if it was because I was very hungry, or if it was because I was nervous, but I fell on my face and started crying. I got back up and took off from the bus stop, and started walking towards where I had seen the bus stop. I was thinking that I should keep walking, but then I saw a girl lying on the ground. She was crying, and I started to walk towards her. I didn't know if she was going to survive the walk, but I kept walking.

I made it to where she was lying on the ground. I looked at her and saw that she was a little over 5 feet tall (I'm almost 5 feet 6). She was wearing a long top, a dress with no bra, and a pair of white shorts. She was really out of it, and she was gasping for air. I didn't know what to do, so I reached out my hand, and she took my hand. She seemed to be in a lot of pain, and was crying. I asked if she was OK, because I needed to keep going, and she didn't answer. I started to walk towards her, and she started to cry even harder. I kept walking, but I was walking in circles. I was trying to get to her, but I couldn't seem to get there. She was so out of it, and I was so afraid of her that I kept walking. Eventually, the walk got too much for me, and I fell flat on my face on the ground. I started to cry even harder, and I knew I was going to die. The feeling of reaching out my hand to her, and getting her to take it, was the most painful thing I've ever felt in my life. At the same time, I remembered that I had one last chance to get her to take it. I didn't want to die, but I didn't want to stay dead either. I reached out my hand, and she took it. I kept walking towards her, but I couldn't seem to get there. I was so afraid of her that I kept walking. Eventually, I fell flat on my face on the ground.

"There was a lot of distrust, a lot of anguish and a lot of tears," said Howard, who was a lifelong Republican. The day after the election, he said, he was at the bar of a downtown Detroit restaurant when he heard a man tell another man, "You're all a bunch of losers."

"I think we need to move forward," Howard said. "It's a time to heal and move forward, and the most important thing is to do that in a civil, constructive way."

For all the talk about local frustration and misery following the election, most of the people interviewed said they felt optimistic.

"I've never felt this way," said Mike Finnigan, a 58-year-old engineer who works in a GM plant in Auburn Hills. "We've been complaining for years and years and years, and all of a sudden, this happens."

For the time being, much of the political tumult will be at the federal level. President-elect Trump has promised to immediately repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, a 2009 federal law that is a cornerstone of the health care system in many states.

By changing the law, Trump could force millions of people — including more than 5 million who get health insurance through the private market — to lose their coverage.

Trump also has vowed to expand a program that provides federal funds to states to create high-risk pools, which are intended to enroll people with pre-existing medical problems. Critics say the plan would lead to higher premiums for healthy people, drive up the cost of health care and increase the number of uninsured in the nation.

Trump has also touted the possibility of getting rid of the estate tax, which is levied on the wealthiest Americans who leave assets to their heirs. The tax has been a source of concern among many Republicans, who have said the change would be regressive.

In addition to the tax changes, Trump has pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act and has vowed to replace it with a system that would include "insurance for everybody." He has not said what form that would take, but he has not ruled out leaving parts of the law in place.

Trump has said he wants to repeal Obamacare "essentially simultaneously" with enacting a replacement plan.

"It will be great health care," Trump said at an Oct. 10 rally in Fayetteville, N.C.

Trump's win has been celebrated in Detroit, where many voters are pleased that their vote went to a Republican who will continue to advocate for the industries they work in.

"I think it's a big deal," said Peter Boven, who works in the automotive industry in Detroit. "I think it's great for the country."

While many people said they were optimistic about the future, many also expressed concern about the possibility that President-elect Trump could be more divisive than President Obama or more prone to trigger a trade war than his Democratic predecessor.

"I think it's unlikely that he'll be anything other than a conservative," Howard said. "But I think we have some challenges ahead of us. I don't think we can just focus on that and ignore the other things that he's going to do."

Others said the country was not ready for the consequences of a Trump presidency.

"There's a lot of fear, a lot of uncertainty, and it's just the beginning," said Chris Shaw, a 30-year-old truck driver in Detroit. "I don't think people are ready for that."

The Federal Trade Commission sent letters to Google and Yahoo! on Tuesday to stop them from scanning messages sent to or from its consumers. If the companies don't comply by February 29, they'll face fines of up to $16 million a day.

The FTC's letter to Google cites privacy concerns, that the company is scanning emails without consent and that it doesn't have to abide by the same privacy standards as the average Internet user.

"The FTC can't oversee Google and Yahoo until they've taken the necessary steps to protect consumer privacy," said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. "This is a common-sense approach that will help ensure that the companies are making the right decisions for their customers."

I'm coming back to movies. Really, I'm coming back to movies. At least, that's what I tell myself. I've been making a movie a year for the past three years. I'm now up to about 10 movies in a year, and I've made about a third of them. So my point is, I'm coming back to movies.

My first movie I made, when I was in college, was called "The Picture of Dorian Gray" (I don't remember if it was a Union Theatrical Release or not). At the time, I was an aspiring screenwriter in New York, and I failed miserably. I wrote a movie that was basically a children's book. I didn't have any money. I thought I'd have enough time to make it, but I didn't. I was a baby. I was so embarrassed by the movie that when I did my first reading of it at the New York Film Festival, the audience was all, "Oh, sorry, you're going to be so famous for it!" So I had to do a second reading. I was so embarrassed by it that I didn't even want anyone to see it. I thought it was so boring. I was so embarrassed by it that I didn't even want the director to see it. I was so embarrassed by it that when I did my second reading at the New York Film Festival, the audience was all, "Oh, sorry, you're going to be so famous for it!" So I had to do a second reading.

I said to myself, "I'm going to make a movie. I'm going to make a movie." I wrote the story. I wrote the actors. I told the director what they should be like. I spent a lot of time at home, so I did have to have some money, but I didn't have the money to hire a lot of people. This is where the movie was supposed to start. I thought it was interesting to make a movie that was a little bit like a children's book. I thought it was interesting to make a movie that was a little bit like a children's book. So I made the movie, and it was a disaster. It was a disaster. I didn't even want to show it to anyone. I didn't want the people in my life to see it. I did my second reading at the New York Film Festival, and at the end of the first reading, the people in the audience were saying, "How are you going to make a movie out of this? This is crap."

"The murder of Uri Ariel, a 32-year-old Israeli hitchhiker who was found dead in a field east of Duma, is outrageous," said AJC President and CEO David Harris. "This murder is a stark reminder that the Israeli government must end its policy of impunity for these crimes against humanity."

Ariel, a father of three, was found dead on June 17. Israeli police said the murder was committed by Palestinian assailants, although the Palestinian Authority and Israel have denied any involvement in the killing.

Israeli police have arrested two suspects in Ariel's killing, but have made no arrests in the other five killings of Israelis in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since October.

The killing of Ariel came days after a 16-year-old Palestinian was killed in Jerusalem after stabbing a soldier. Police said the Palestinian was a Palestinian resident of Jerusalem who entered Israel through the Allenby Bridge crossing into Jordan, and was not an Israeli citizen.

Amnon Cohen, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the murder was a "clear case of incitement," referring to comments by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas that "it's time to open fire" on Jews.

Ariel's family has requested that the body be returned to Israel.

Ariel's brother was also kidnapped and killed by Palestinians in 2014.<|endoftext|>The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Story of the Stone, by Frank Belknap Long This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

[The narrative of The Story of the Stone follows the story of a little girl, who, having been taken ill, is brought home by her parents, who are all in a great turmoil. The patient mother, who has not been able to make anything in the house but bread and water, finds herself constantly in fear and anxiety, and is even forced to ask her husband to be allowed to go out at night, because she is always afraid of his going for shelter to her bed. She is anxious for the little girl, whose health is not so good as it ought to be, because she has a very bad cough, and hears that she is not well. She is anxious for her husband, whom she fears to be less than himself, because he has the most serious illness of his life. She is anxious for the little girl, whose name is Alice, and who, the reader will remember, is the daughter of a farmer whose farm was just taken from him, because he had sold a sheep in Ireland, and the following circumstances happened to him at the same time. He was afflicted with his wife's sickness, and he gave her to the priest for a cure, and the priest cured the wife of her sickness. Afterwards the priest came to him, and said that he had found in the house the body of a man, who had been buried on the same land where he had been buried, and that he would be a great gainer if he would sell the land to a man from the neighbouring village, who was ill of his own and whose wife was sick, and he was anxious to make the sale. He sold the land to the man who was ill, and he brought him

"I'm a child of the 80s," says a man who looks like he's in his late 50s. "I was a kid when they showed Rocky IV, I was a kid when they showed Terminator 2, I was a kid when they showed Star Wars. I'm a child of the 80s."

Well, I suppose that's a bit of a mistake, because the man in question is actually a Welshman called Jeff Bridges. He is also a lifelong sci-fi fan (in fact, the film he's talking about was Blade Runner) and a big Star Wars fan, and he's chatting up an Artificial Intelligence expert who has worked for a while on a project to get computers to be able to "understand" the content of movies they've been given.

The idea that computers can understand what you're looking at and telling you is nothing new. That was the goal of the MIT Media Lab's Sophia Antipolis and Joel Waldfogel teams, who in 2009 built an AI that could understand the content of a video and then tell you what it was and who it was for.

But the team of scientists behind the project wanted a bit more than just "understanding." They wanted a machine that could understand the meaning of a scene – the kind of thing a human being can do. And they thought the best way to do it was to build a computer that was "related" to the audience.

The idea is that humans and machines can communicate by reading the emotions and interactions of other humans. You can see this in the things people do when they interact with each other. So if you have a computer system that can understand the meaning of a movie, you might be able to use it to make it more engaging. You might be able to have a computer system that understands the emotional state of a moviegoer and then tell the audience what they should be feeling. Or maybe you could have a computer that understands the meaning of a movie, but then the audience could tell it what to do within that movie.

Instead of just telling the audience what's going to happen, maybe you could tell the audience what they should be feeling.

That's one of the goals of the new project, called the "Emotion Machine". It's being led by a group of researchers at MIT's Media Lab, and it's already being tested on a small number of moviegoers in a small number of theaters.

But the project also has a more grand, "meta" goal: to develop a way of building more complex emotional experiences.

Jeff Bridges is talking about this goal in his office at the Malibu home he shares with his wife, actress Vanessa Redgrave, and their two children. He's wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase "AI: Good, Wise, and Loving", and he points to a small box on his desk.

"This is called the emotion machine," says Bridges.

And he's not just talking about a computer program that can understand a movie. He's talking about a machine that can understand the meaning of a scene – the kind of thing a human being can do. And he's talking about a machine that can understand the emotion of a scene, and then tell the audience what they should be feeling. Or maybe you could have a computer that understands the meaning of a movie, but then the audience could tell it what to do within that movie.

"This is the first tangible proof that it's possible," he says. "I think it's going to be pretty big. I think it's a good way to tell people, 'Look, this is what's going to happen.'"

That's not the kind of talk you often hear from someone who has spent his career trying to build artificial intelligence. But Jeff Bridges, like many of the people who work in the field, has seen the promise of machine learning and has taken to the challenge of trying to make that learning go further.

In the last few years, he's become a key figure in efforts to develop artificial intelligence. He's helped to develop technologies that can teach computers to "understand" human language. He's also helped to develop technologies that can teach computers to do the kinds of things that human beings can do.

"The first thing that came to mind is that the computer can understand a scene," he says. "But how do you tell the computer to understand the meaning of a scene? And that's what the emotional machine is because that's the first step."

In other words, the machine isn't just a computer program that can understand a scene. It's a machine that can understand meaning. It's a machine that can tell you what you should be feeling.

It's a machine that can also tell you what you should do.

***

The emotion machine isn't very good at understanding scenes. That's because it's using an approach that's not very well optimized

Michael Flynn's secret conversations with Russia's ambassador to the United States were first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed by other news outlets.

The White House has tried to distance itself from his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, saying they were to ensure that sanctions against Russia were not being "put in place" during the incoming administration's first days in office.

The Post reported that Flynn and Kislyak exchanged text messages during the transition about sanctions and the possibility of lifting them.

Flynn's conversations with Kislyak are the latest example of Flynn's ties to Russia, a relationship that he has repeatedly denied. On Friday, The Post reported that Flynn called Russian President Vladi­mir Putin "a killer" and "a thug" in a phone call in December.

In a statement late Friday night, Flynn said he "inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology."

Flynn, who was forced to resign after just 24 days in the Trump administration, sat down with The Post on March 2 at the request of its editors to discuss his role in the Trump transition and his conversations with the Russian ambassador.

Flynn was charged in March with making false statements to the FBI. The false statements charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

In their interview, Flynn and Kislyak discussed the logistics of setting up a call between Trump and Russian President Vladi­mir Putin, The Post reported.

Flynn's role in setting up the call raised questions among some of the Trump administration's critics, who said the Flynn's role in setting up the call raised questions among some of the Trump administration's critics, who said the communications raised questions about Trump's intentions toward Russia.

"In my opinion, Flynn has the same attitude toward Russia as former president Obama did toward Russia," said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. "Flynn's comments to the Russian ambassador were a deliberate effort to cover up the Trump administration's secret, pre-inauguration discussions with the Russians."

In his interview with The Post, Flynn expressed curiosity about the allegations about his contacts with Kislyak. He described in detail his contacts with Kislyak, who did not respond to requests for comment.

In those conversations, Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions, according to The Post, which cited current and former U.S. officials.

Flynn and Kislyak also discussed the possibility of establishing a secret and secure line of communication between Trump and the Kremlin, according to officials who have been briefed on the conversations. That proposal was never pursued, officials said.

Flynn's discussions with Kislyak also touched on the possibility of lifting U.S. sanctions on Russia, known as the "Kremlin sanctions" and put in place by President Barack Obama in December. Under the sanctions, the Kremlin was prohibited from suspending some of the most significant financial sanctions on Russia imposed by the Obama administration in retaliation for Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 campaign.

The relationship between Flynn and Kislyak had been tenuous. The two men had not spoken for months. In the intervening period, Kislyak had become increasingly frustrated with the Obama administration and had complained to U.S. officials about what he saw as an overly aggressive approach by the Obama administration to Russia policy.

Flynn was a vocal supporter of Trump during the campaign and transition and was a trusted adviser to Trump on national security issues.

"As you know, the 'War on Coal' is over."

That was the opening line of a recent article in The New York Times by James F. Tracy. The piece seemed to be a response to the recent announcement that the Obama administration was withdrawing coal mining leases from nearly two-thirds of the U.S. Department of the Interior's lands.

Coal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. It's produced from underground mining and is responsible for 4 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to causing global climate change, coal combustion releases pollutants that cause a variety of health problems, including lung cancer and other respiratory issues. And as the Times noted, when it comes to climate change, "the coal industry is a loser."

But the Obama administration has made clear that, while it is abandoning coal, it is not abandoning the fossil fuel industry.

"We have a long history of using coal to power our country and we look forward to continuing to develop clean coal technology that can provide America with thousands of new jobs," Obama said in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on March 27, 2011.

"In the coming years, we're going to have to confirm a new EPA administrator, who will be in charge of a agency that has been known to interfere with the private sector, and that has been known to be too cozy with the coal industry," Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said in a statement on March 28, 2011.

President Obama's term in office is almost over, and many of his environmental policies are in the process of being reversed, including the "War on Coal." But the president and his administration have not abandoned the fossil fuel industry.

If anything, they've escalated it, creating a phenomenon known as "fracking."

"The administration has been on a campaign to tap the fracking revolution, to make it more pervasive and accessible," said David Turnbull, director of the Center for the Study of Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder. "The president has simply accelerated the process."

Obama's administration has also put an emphasis on renewable energy, which has been making headlines lately, most recently when the administration announced that it would require thousands of new solar and wind facilities to be built nationwide by 2022.

The Obama administration has also supported the Keystone XL Pipeline.

But it's not just the president who is boosting the coal industry. The Environmental Protection Agency, in partnership with the Department of Energy, has been promoting "clean coal" technology, which is touted as the "silver bullet" to the nation's energy woes.

"Clean coal" is a technology that is supposed to extract the carbon dioxide emissions from coal plants. But, as the Times pointed out, there is no way to actually develop a commercially viable "clean" coal technology.

So, instead, the EPA, in partnership with the Department of Energy, has considered projects and public-private partnerships that encourage the use of natural gas, which is known to have greater carbon dioxide emissions. The Times noted that "the EPA has been one of the major funders of the research."

As the Times pointed out, the gas, called "zinc hexafluoride," has not been proven to be a "cleaner" fuel. And, it's not clear that the technology would be cost-effective, either.

The EPA has also been promoting the use of "advanced coal technology," an idea that the Times noted, "has received little attention."

The Times also noted that the Obama administration's executive agreement with China, which calls for the U.S. to shut down some coal-fired power plants, has "created a climate of fear among the industry, with companies, utilities and power plants rushing to get out ahead of it."

And, in addition to "clean coal," the Obama administration has also promoted "carbon capture and sequestration" technology, which is supposed to remove carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired plants. Most of the carbon dioxide generated by coal plants is CO2 that the plants have already emitted, and the EPA has estimated that capturing and storing the CO2 would cost about $40 billion.

"The Obama administration has done nothing to put a halt to the coal industry's decline," said Greg Sorrell, a spokesman for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. "It continues to deny the science of climate change."

"Coal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels," said Sorrell. "It's produced from underground mining and is responsible for 4 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions."

"In the coming years, we're going to have to confirm a new EPA administrator, who will be in charge of a agency that has been known to interfere with the private sector, and that has been known to be too cozy with the coal industry," said Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., in a statement on

Although the duration of the French Revolution is disputed, the years from 1789 to 1799 are generally considered the years of the popular revolution. You can read more about the revolution here.

The revolutionary years

The date of the French revolution can be traced back to a single day, July 14, 1789, when a mob set fire to the Bastille in Paris. Since then, the revolution has been as much a social movement as an economic one. The French Revolution was the first in modern history to be declared by the people and for the people.

The revolution broke out after the death of King Louis XVI in 1792. The new king, the king of France, took power on July 28, 1793. However, the king had a deeply conservative streak, and was determined to maintain the status quo, which meant keeping the monarchy. The king's brother, the Duke of Orleans, was a powerful man and the king's main rival.

In 1794, the Duke of Orleans went to war with the King of Spain. Although the king was victorious, the war was a disaster for France. On July 14, 1794, the Duke of Orleans was assassinated by a French soldier named Danton. Shortly after the assassination, the King of Spain quickly fled to Holland, leaving the French throne vacant.

Unable to find a willing successor to the throne, King Louis XVI died on July 28, 1794. He had been ill, and was suffering from a severe head wound. He was replaced by his brother, the Duke of Orleans.

Danton and the king's brother, King Louis XVI, had a falling out over the monarchy. Danton was furious at the king and his brother for their lack of support for him after his assassination, and went on a violent rampage. He proceeded to attack and kill many people, including King Louis XVI's bodyguards, who had come to his house to protect him.

The Duke of Orleans left the country and returned to England, where he was arrested and tried for the murder of King Louis XVI. That trial began on August 14, 1794. On September 24, 1794, the Duke of Orleans was found guilty and executed.

The next day, the king's brother, the Duke of Orleans, was arrested and executed in France for the same crime. That same day, about 1,000 Frenchmen gathered at the Place de la Revolution and declared the French revolution, which was the first of the French republics.

The revolution was a successful one. The French republic took over the government of France, which had been ruled by the monarchy since 1789. The National Assembly took over and created the French Constitution, which was approved by the French people on November 10, 1793.

The French Revolution

The French Revolution was an extremely large, complex revolution. It is also one of the most important events in modern history.

The revolution began in Paris on July 14, 1789, when a group of people set fire to the Bastille in Paris. That fire was followed by a violent civil war in which the government was overthrown. The French army was unable to hold onto the French capital, and the French monarchy was abolished.

The French revolution was the first to be declared by the people, and for the people. The French people were outraged by the monarchy, which they thought had been tied to the king's death by the Duke of Orleans. Many people joined the revolutionary movement, but the majority of the people — especially those who lived in the countryside and were more influenced by traditional religious beliefs — remained loyal to the monarchy.

The French Revolution greatly changed the French political landscape and society. The French revolution changed the country in many ways.

In 1793, France was a feudal monarchy. Its power rested on a powerful, powerful, feudal aristocracy. The French Revolution changed that. It fundamentally transformed the country.

(CNN) -- He may be the most famous man in the world, but famous can be a pretentious job.

The actor George Clooney and his wife Amal are being criticized for their $5 million French chateau in the south of France, which they purchased in 2004 for $1.2 million.

But the couple -- who have three other homes in the United States -- are not the first celebrity couple to buy a chateau.

In fact, Forbes magazine calculates that it would cost Americans $1.2 million to purchase the same property in France.

The Clooneys, who are responsible for two of the most successful movies of the 1990s, "Forrest Gump" and "Ocean's Eleven," bought the estate in Bordeaux in 2004.

The Clooneys have since made several other purchases, including a $9.5 million beachfront home on Malibu's Pacific Coast Highway, a $3.5 million home on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a $2.2 million home in Beverly Hills, California, and a $2.4 million condo in Toronto, according to the National Geographic.

The couple also owns a $3 million house outside of Los Angeles, the Andrew Lloyd Webber Theater in Manhattan and a $2.3 million house in Miami.

The couple's decision to acquire a chateau in France has also caused some controversy, especially in France.

France's environment minister, Nicolas Hulot, has said the $5 million price tag for the chateau is "too high" and has warned that the property will be much more expensive when it's eventually sold.

Critics also pointed out that the mansion is only partially finished, and that the Clooneys bought it for the wrong price.

He said that in a decade, we'd have connected billions of devices to the internet and that by 2017 we'd all be wearing Google Glass. He said he was wrong, and now he's right again — just in the wrong way.

Last week, Facebook announced it was acquiring the mobile messaging app Snapchat, for $3 billion, in a deal that will allow the social network to offer its own version of the app for people to share stories and videos using their smartphones.

To Zuckerberg's point, it's only a matter of time until we start wearing Google Glass — and we're already seeing some hints at that with the emerging wearable technology.

It's not a stretch to say that in five years we'll all have Google Glass

Zuckerberg's prediction could have been a joke. But according to a new infographic, he was spot on. Sure, the technology isn't quite there yet. But the time is right for the wearable tech to take off.

This infographic, created by the startup Dynatrace, shows the future of wearable tech as it stands today. It includes everything from the Oculus Rift and Google Glass to the Apple Watch.

More importantly, however, it shows how quickly the technology is moving. Not only is Google already working on another version of Glass, the company is in the process of developing its own version of Google Glass — and that model is expected to launch next year.

The infographic has a lot of visual clues that point to the inevitable arrival of Google Glass.

We're already seeing a lot of people wearing Google Glass

Looking at the figures, we see that there are already a lot of people wearing Google Glass. In fact, Google Glass is already available to buy in the US on the company's website.

And it's not just the US and Canada. Countries like Brazil, Japan, China, and Australia have also started getting their own versions of the wearable tech.

To be clear, Google Glass is a very different product from the current Google Glass Explorer Program, which lets people get their hands on the tech for free. The Explorer Program is currently only open to US residents.

But Google Glass is still very much a product in development. And it's only a matter of time before Google's version will hit the market.

When Google Glass does launch, it'll probably be a fairly familiar product. The current model has a screen on the front of the device with a small camera and a tiny touchpad on the side. There's also a microphone on the back.

The company recently showed off a prototype of the next generation of Google Glass, which will include a larger display and a microphone on the front. Like the current model, the new model will also have a touchpad on the side of the device.

We have a feeling that we'll see the next generation of Google Glass released in the next few years. And, if history is any indication, we're going to see it in the form of Google Glass.<|endoftext|>How hard is it to get a little snow at the fair?

The modern concept of a "computer" is a lot more complicated than most people realize.

Most people (including me) would probably say that a computer is a device that processes some information and then puts the result in some format. Some might even say that a computer is a device that has some information and discards it.

The most basic computer could probably be considered to be a device that has some information and discards it. It could be a computer with a hard drive, a computer with a stored program, a computer with an operating system, or a computer with a database.

In the early days of computing, computers were also referred to as "hard disks" or "brick machines". In those days, the disk was created on-the-fly and was stored on a wooden disk drive, or possibly a mechanical disk drive.

There are still some basic computers that are powered by electricity, but most of them now use integrated circuits.

There are several basic types of computers, including:

Hardware computers would have a processor, memory, and in some cases a hard disk.

There are many different types of computers, but the most basic are the ones that we usually think of. Most people automatically think of computers as "hard disks", but they can also be "hard diskless" computers, "memoryless" computers, "hard diskless memoryless computers", "memoryless memoryless computers", "hard diskless networked computers", "memoryless networked computers", or "computer that runs on a disk".

I think we can all agree that a computer is a device that has some information and discards it.

The announcement comes after several major cities in France banned the swimsuits in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Nice and the Bataclan concert hall in Paris.

It's not the first time Brunei has made headlines for its progressive views.

In 2015, the country issued a ruling that women must be treated as equal to men and that the country was not discriminatory against women.

The ruling was made following the death of a young woman in the country who had been accused of witchcraft.

The country also has a high rate of female genital mutilation (FGM), in which girls as young as four are cut open.

The announcement in Brunei comes after several countries across Europe banned swimwear, including the burkini, following the terrorist attacks in Nice and the Bataclan concert hall in Paris.

I've been enthralled with your work since I was a kid (I distinctly remember reading the first volume of the Encyclopedia in my early teens). I've been a huge fan of your art since the first issue came out. I first became aware of your work when I saw it in the "Friday the 13th" series. I was instantly hooked.  I've bought every issue of your series, the movies, the comics, the video games, and I still own the show and the movie. I admire you for all of the great work you have done. It's a true honor to have you as my favorite artist. I want to make sure I do it correctly, though. I'm going to try to do the best I can. I know there's a lot of people that would love to see your art in a new way. I've had a clear vision of how I want it to look, but I still want to make sure I do it right. I want to do it right so that you can look at it and know that it will not look like any other book that I've done. I've had the chance to talk to the editors about that, and they think it's a great idea. I'm going to do my best to make it happen. I'm also going to be making it happen with the help of some of my favorite artists. I'm going to be working with the talented friends that I've worked with on my own projects such as John Cassaday and James Stokoe. I've been working with some other talented artists as well on a number of different projects.
For those of you who don't know, John Cassaday created the Cassaday Designs and John Stokoe is a veteran of the comics industry. You will also be seeing the work of J. Scott Campbell and a few other talented artists! I look forward to sharing all of the work that the talented artists have done with you. 
I also want to thank you for all of the wonderful messages you've been sending me. I know that you've been a busy bee and I'm so happy that you've been able to keep me in the loop. I love it when you tell me that you love my work and I love if you tell me that you love my website! It's really nice to know that there are people out there that are excited about my work and want to see more of it. I was very surprised by the number of people that I've been able to get in touch with. I'm really excited to have you on board, and I hope you'll check back soon.<|endoftext|>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Richard Galpin says the two sides have yet to sign the deal

An agreement has been reached
======================================== SAMPLE 123 ========================================
This story is part of a special series produced in partnership with Climate Central to highlight the work of leading climate scientists and their organizations.

With just a few days left before the Paris conference on climate change, negotiators in Copenhagen are still struggling to reach an agreement. A key sticking point is how to account for the emissions of greenhouse gases that are already in the atmosphere.

Scientists have found that in the coming decades, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will rise to levels that scientists say are beyond anything the planet has seen in at least the past 800,000 years, and possibly much longer.

The problem is that scientists have not been able to account for those emissions. And while they have been trying to find a way to do so, so far there has been no agreement at the conference to do just that.

"The one thing that is clear is that in the absence of an agreement, the most likely scenario in the next few years would be that the global temperature increase would be between three and four degrees Celsius above what we have seen in the last century," says Kurt Lambeck, climate scientist at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.

Lambeck and his team have been developing a way to account for the emissions of greenhouse gases that are already in the atmosphere — the so-called "radiative forcing," which is the change in how much radiation the Earth receives from the sun.

"Radiative forcing is an important part of the climate system that we are trying to understand better," Lambeck says.

Observing climate change

The radiative forcing that Lambeck is investigating is different from the other sources of climate change. For example, solar radiation is the cause of climate change: Earth absorbs more of the sun's energy and turns it into heat. Radiative forcing is the change in how much energy the Earth emits and receives from the sun.

But because the climate system is so complex, scientists cannot really get a handle on the entire system without accounting for all of the climate system's components.

Lambeck says his team has been able to find the right buffer between the warming and the cooling of the climate system by adding up all of the different types of data they have been collecting, including the changes in ocean temperatures, the amount of snow on the ground, the amount of snow and ice in the atmosphere and the atmospheric density of the air.

"We're trying to balance the potential warming — the amount of greenhouse gases emitted — and the possible cooling — the amount of heat that the oceans are absorbing from the sun," Lambeck says.

For the past 15 years, Lambeck has been looking at these changes in the atmosphere and ocean to try to figure out how much of the forcing from greenhouse gases the Earth is absorbing.

"We've been looking at the global climate system, looking at the ocean, the atmosphere, the land and the ice, and trying to figure out what's happening with our global climate," Lambeck says. "And we've been trying to account for all of the different components that are going into the atmosphere."

Lambeck says another crucial piece of the puzzle is the role that the oceans play in climate change. Using data from the past decade, Lambeck and his team have found that the oceans are absorbing about a third of the heat that is being transferred from the atmosphere to the oceans.

"The ocean is significant in the climate system," Lambeck says. "It's a key part of the climate systems that we are trying to understand better."

A challenge in counting greenhouse gases

Lambeck says that the main challenge in estimating the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is that the amount of greenhouse gases that are emitting has a lot to do with where they are in the atmosphere and where they are in the ocean.

"The whole atmospheric greenhouse gas inventory is very much dependent on where it's actually in the atmosphere," Lambeck says. "In the ocean, you can just write a number of tens of billions of tons, and you have a very good idea of what's going into the ocean."

But when we look at the ocean surface, Lambeck says, we have to account for all of the factors that impact how the ocean absorbs atmospheric greenhouse gases.

Lambeck and his team are working to address that challenge.

"We're trying to come up with a better measurement system than we have right now," Lambeck says. "We're trying to come up with a better method than we have right now."

Lambeck says they hope to have the new measurement system in place by the time negotiators meet in Paris, but no one knows for sure when that will be.<|endoftext|>Awards

But that's not what they are hearing from their representatives.

The survey released Wednesday finds that Americans, by a wide margin, believe that lawmakers should compromise, and they want their representatives to compromise. But the public when asked what they would rather see happen, fewer than half (46 percent) say they would prefer that lawmakers compromise, while more than three-quarters (77 percent) say they want lawmakers to stay firm in their positions.

So, does that mean the public is pro-compromise? The answer is no. A majority of Americans (52 percent) say they have been "very satisfied" by the way Congress is working, and a majority of Americans (56 percent) say the same about the way President Obama is handling his job.

What's more, the public is in no mood to compromise in general. In fact, if Congress were to compromise on its current agenda, most Americans (62 percent) would disapprove.

This isn't to say that the public is completely indifferent to compromise. Asked whether they would prefer their representatives to "keep their current positions and work to reach compromise," a sizable 52 percent of Americans say they would prefer that they do this. An additional 26 percent say they would prefer that they compromise but that their representatives stay firm.<|endoftext|>The first two albums from the supergroup Soul Asylum have been remixed to feature more original music, and now they're also getting a vinyl reissue.

But the political pressure on President Obama — who in turn has been under intense pressure from some of his most important allies on Capitol Hill to reach an agreement — is mounting.

For the past two weeks, the Obama administration has been engaged in intense negotiations with Iran, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China over the terms of a comprehensive deal that would curb Iran's nuclear program.

Some in the Obama administration, including Mr. Kerry, have suggested that the talks could produce an agreement by the end of March. But the disagreements among the countries involved have not gone away.

The talks have been moving slowly, with each side saying the other is holding out for more to help seal the deal, and with the self-imposed deadline set by the United States to complete the negotiations slipping into April.

On Wednesday, the administration announced that it would postpone the deadline for the talks by six weeks, until March 31, the end of the month. The American negotiators have been insisting on agreement on a package of sanctions be imposed on Iran, while the Iranian side has been pushing for a more comprehensive agreement that would include all the sanctions.<|endoftext|>The HSR Bus Route is a new service that will allow people travelling on the HSR network to get to and from the Metro.

This is a simple tool to create a template from a file as a template for a template block.

It does this by using some Python code that executes the template block, converting it to a simple string, and then recursively calling the template block with the variable name.

You can find the source here .

Why is this useful?

You can now easily create a template without having to write a lot of code and run it through a template generator.

You can also easily modify a template block after it is created or even create a new template block.

Installation

Install via pip:

pip install template_generator

Usage

Simply create a file called template.py :

Template.py import tg from template_generator import TemplateGenerator tg.create( ' template.py ' )

Then, use the from template_generator import TemplateGenerator macro to create a template.

For example:

Template.py class MyTemplate ( tg . Template ): @tf.variable ( ' name ' , default = ' Andy ' ) def name ( self ): return " Andy " tg.run(MyTemplate())

If you don't want the variable name to be "name", you can either pass in a string, or call self.variable() and the variable name will be used instead.<|endoftext|>We've all been there: we're watching The Walking Dead, and suddenly the zombie horde is upon us. The only thought in our heads is, "How do I escape the horde?" And then, suddenly, a character says, "We can't let the zombies get us. You have to fight back!"

And that's when we start running.

It's a simple concept in theory, but as far as zombie survival strategies go, it's an incredibly effective one. You can't win with strategy, and if you can't fight back, you're dead. But here's the thing: zombie survival strategies aren't just about running; they're about being a warrior.

Being a warrior means that you're able to fight off the horde and take out not only the zombies, but also the people that are trying to take them down. It means that you're able to protect yourself, your family, and your community. And it means that you're able to inspire others to do the same.

In many ways, being a warrior means being a leader. It means you're willing to do the tough things, and be the kind of person who makes others feel empowered.

Let's talk about the dangers of being a warrior.

The Warrior Mentality Requires Great Courage

The warrior mentality is often described as a state in which you have to be willing to do what's hard and risk your own life for the safety and well-being of others. It's a mentality that requires great courage and is often associated with being tough, stoic, and determined.

Share On Facebook Tweet Pin It Email<|endoftext|>(CNN) -- A new study suggests that more than 9 million Americans suffer from eating disorders, making the disorder the most prevalent mental illness in the United States.

In the study, published in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry, researchers from the University of Southern California and Columbia University found that 8.4 million people had an eating disorder in 2008, accounting for about 5.2% of the U.S. population.

The researchers said that, across the country, many people are struggling with eating disorders, which are characterized by a pattern of recurrent episodes of eating or weight-related behaviors that results in restrictive weight-control habits and anorexia nervosa.

Many people with eating disorders have mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorders, according to the National Eating Disorders Association.

"The American Psychiatric Association (APA) defines anorexia nervosa as a severe and persistent pattern of binge eating and other weight-control behaviors that can severely limit a person's ability to function in the world and lead to dangerously small body weight," the association said.

"Anorexia nervosa is a serious mental illness with a significant impact on a person's life, including increasing risk for suicide, substance abuse and other psychiatric symptoms," it said. "The condition is treatable with a combination of behavioral therapy, psychotherapy and medications."

The researchers said their study was based on data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

The authors noted that the prevalence of eating disorders could vary by state and the country as a whole.

The authors also noted that because of their size, the numbers used in the study were conservative.

"For example, we included only people who had been seen by a primary care physician within the past year to capture the majority of eating disorder cases," the authors said. "In addition, our sample is based on a self-selected sample of people who self-selected themselves for the study. This suggested to us that the results of the study are not biased by bias of participants" or "unrepresentative" individuals.

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Center for Health Statistics and the National Institute of Mental Health. The authors said they do not have any financial relationships with any organizations sponsoring this research.<|endoftext|>The U.S. was duped into a false war on terror, and now it's paying the price, writes former CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar, who was an Iraq war planner in the George W. Bush administration.

By Paul R. Pillar

If you want to learn about the origins of the Iraq war, the United States, and the global war on terror, you cannot go past the September 11, 2001, attacks. Or to put it another way, you cannot go past the CIA's information operations in the aftermath of those attacks.

The September 11 attacks were the product of an intelligence failure on the part of the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA's information operations, which were the most significant part of its prewar intelligence collection, were designed to help President Bush and his national security team prevent attacks on the United States. But they were not designed to capture Osama bin Laden or to establish a "war on terror" that would justify the war in Iraq. Despite having a very good information operation, and despite having the ability to gather and analyze data related to al Qaeda and the global jihad, the CIA was not able to do its job.

The CIA's intelligence failures that led to the September 11 attacks occurred because the CIA failed to prepare for a huge number of contingency plans. Those contingency plans, of which there were many, were designed by the CIA to respond to a variety of unexpected problems that could have occurred if the agency were not able to gather and analyze as much intelligence as it was able to.

What is the difference between a bicycle helmet and a bicycle safety helmet?

A bicycle safety helmet is a safety device fitted to a bicycle that makes it safer to ride. It includes a rigid head shield, a chin strap, an airbag and a built-in air pressure monitor.

A bicycle helmet is designed to protect your head, not your body. It is not a car seat, ski or motorcycle helmet.

Which types of bicycle helmets are used in the USA?

There are three types of bicycle helmets that are used in the USA:

A CPSC (Cyclist Protection Standard) certified bicycle helmet: CPSC is an international standard for bicycle helmets and helmets for use in motorized cycles. It has been endorsed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and is used in the United States by ANSI-accredited bicycle safety program.

A Snell certified bicycle helmet: Snell is an international standard for bicycle helmets and helmets for use in motorized cycles. Snell is endorsed by the Snell Memorial Foundation and is used in the USA by Snell Memorial.

A Snell certified helmet that is not approved for use by the Snell Memorial Foundation: Snell Memorial Foundation is an official foundation of the Snell Memorial Foundation, the first and only organization to award an official Snell Memorial Foundation certification to a helmet.

What is the difference between a motorcycle helmet and a bicycle helmet?

A motorcycle helmet is designed to protect the head and face from injury caused by a motor vehicle.

A bicycle helmet is designed to protect the head and face from injury caused by a bicycle.

Bicycle helmets that are certified to Snell or Snell Memorial standards are not used in the USA.

Which helmets are used in the UK?

There are a number of bicycle helmets that are approved for use by UK health authorities. Some are certified to Snell or Snell Memorial standards.

In the UK, you are allowed to use a helmet that meets the standards of either Snell or Snell Memorial.

The U.S. Army has recently selected a company to develop a mobile artillery system that would be used by the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division. The system would consist of a new, modular artillery system that could be adapted to fit the requirements of a variety of different missions.

The system would be designed to seize or destroy enemy buildings, enemy combatants, or enemy communications. The system would be able to fire in a variety of ways, depending on the mission.

The system is currently being developed by the company's Airborne Systems Division, a division of Belkin, a company specializing in communications, sensors, and computers. Belkin has an established track record in designing, developing, and manufacturing mobile artillery systems. The company has also successfully developed the system being selected by the U.S. Army, and for use by the United Kingdom.

In a press release, Belkin says, "The system is not currently designed to engage enemy military objectives, but is designed to provide a mobile fire support capability. Its modular design enables it to be adapted to the mission, and to do so quickly." According to Belkin, the system is intended to be capable of "conducting fire support and intelligence missions, and also can be used in air defense."

The system will be a joint project between Belkin and the U.S. Army, and will consist of two modular units, the long-range artillery system and the short-range artillery system. The short-range system is intended to be used in a flexible manner, capable of providing protection for friendly forces, or attacking enemy forces. The long-range system is intended to be used for rapid artillery missions, or for fire support of friendly forces in a variety of scenarios.

The modular design of the system allows it to be adapted to a variety of missions. The first module will be the short-range artillery system, which would consist of a variety of different weapons. The longer-range artillery system is intended to be used in a flexible manner, and has different weapons.

The system will be able to be quickly deployed, and will be able to provide fire support for multiple units.

The system will be able to fire weapons capable of firing in a variety of ways, depending on the mission. For example, the system could fire as a rocket launcher, or it could fire an M777 howitzer. The short-range system is designed to destroy enemy communication and communications, while the longer-range system can be used to support friendly troops.

The system is currently being developed with a $150 million contract awarded by the U.S. Army.

The U.S. Army has been looking into the mobile artillery capabilities of the gas-propelled artillery system for some time. A previous system, the M777 howitzer, was designed to be mobile, but it was not as successful as originally thought. The Army was looking for a new system to replace the M777.

The new system will be developed by the Belkin company, and will be used by the U.S. Army. The U.S. Army has ordered a 10-year contract, and the system will be deployed in 2018.

Senate Bill 2060, sponsored by Sen. Stephen Fink, R-Hart, will also require that any changes to the law be made as part of a multi-year legislative process.

The legislation also requires the state to continue to offer marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

Until now, only the Colorado Civil Rights Division had the authority to allow the state to withhold a marriage license from a gay couple. The division can grant the license on a case-by-case basis, but it can only do so if the couple agrees.

The new law, which took effect Dec. 31, gives the state attorney general the power to deny a marriage license to a lesbian couple for any reason, including a complaint that they are unfit parents or have a history of domestic violence.

That power could be used to deny a license to a same-sex couple if the state attorney general determines that the couple is a danger to themselves or others, a domestic violence survivor, or the child of the couple if the couple is confined to a nursing home or hospital.

Although the law does not define "genetic material," the bill says it applies to "the genetic material from a human being that is derived from DNA."

The bill also includes a list of exceptions to the ban on same-sex marriage.

Those include if a couple gives birth to a child together and the child is adopted by a same-sex couple.

The bill also contains a list of reasons a marriage license cannot be denied, including if the couple has had a

Perhaps the most important of these is: "There is blame on both sides."

Certainly, this is a more nuanced statement than the one made by the president himself. While he did not explicitly say that there was blame on both sides, he did say that there was blame on "many sides," implying that there is responsibility on both sides.

But this is a slippery slope. In fact, the idea that there is only one side to blame is a fundamental misunderstanding of what's happening on the ground.

Take this blog post from an anonymous Charlottesville resident:

To believe that the racist groups and the anti-racist groups are equivalent is to believe that the KKK is equivalent to the civil rights movement. The KKK was founded to oppose the civil rights movement. The civil rights movement was founded to oppose the KKK.

The same can be said of the Charlottesville protest. The protest was not about removing a statue of Robert E. Lee. It was about removing a statue of a Confederate soldier. The protesters were not trying to stop the march of hundreds of white supremacists. The protesters were not trying to stop the march of neo-Nazis. The protesters were not trying to stop a rally by the Ku Klux Klan. The protesters were not trying to stop a rally by the neo-Nazi group. The protesters were not trying to stop a march by neo-Nazi groups.

The protesters were not trying to stop the march of Nazis. The protesters were not trying to stop the march of white supremacists. The protests were not about removing a statue of a Confederate soldier. The protest was about removing a statue of a Confederate soldier.

The protesters were not trying to stop the march of white supremacists. The protesters were not trying to stop the march of neo-Nazis. The protesters were not trying to stop a rally by the KKK.

The protests were not about removing a statue of a Confederate soldier. The protest was about removing a statue of a Confederate soldier.

The protesters were not trying to stop any of these groups. They were trying to stop the march of Nazis. These groups are not the same. They are not equivalent. They are not equal.

When it comes to the use of medical marijuana, the United States is still in uncharted waters.

The FDA's approval of medical marijuana in 1996, the first such authorization in the country, gave the green light for states to begin implementing their own medical marijuana programs. Colorado, Washington, Alaska and Oregon have already passed laws allowing the use of medical marijuana in the state.

It was in 1996 that the first federal law was passed, making it a crime to possess marijuana (or its derivatives) without a prescription. That law has since been amended multiple times, with each amendment giving more protections to patients and providers. The latest version of the law, known as the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States (CARERS) Act, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in October.

While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, the federal government has said that it will not interfere with states that have legalized marijuana.

The states have also had to contend with a difference in federal law.

The Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which oversees the manufacture, distribution and sale of drugs, allows for medical marijuana use. But the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 also forbids any pharmacists from selling the drug. So most marijuana is dispensed in pharmacies, and all marijuana must be obtained through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is responsible for monitoring marijuana distribution.

"The federal law is very clear that it's illegal to sell marijuana directly to someone," said Brian Vicente, spokesman for Americans for Safe Access, an organization that has lobbied to expand marijuana law reform in the states. "The problem is, it's very difficult for a Licensed Marijuana Dispensary to get into the business. If the state allows it, it will allow the dispensing of medical marijuana, and the federal government can't stop that."

"There's a weakness in the law," Vicente added. "If you have a dispensary and a state says you're a dispensary, you can't sell to someone who is not a medical marijuana patient. It's a law that's not enforced and that's why you have so many dispensaries with no business."

The DEA's enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act has been far less strict than the FDA's. Recently, the DEA began issuing warnings to dispensaries in Colorado for committing crimes, including the sale of marijuana to people who are not registered medical marijuana users.

"There are a lot of loopholes in the law, and I think that's why the DEA is concerned," Vicente said.

One of the loopholes is that the Controlled Substances Act allows doctors to prescribe controlled substances to patients if the prescription is issued by a physician with a legitimate reason to believe that the patient has a debilitating disease or condition. That's a loophole that has been exploited by dispensaries, which have been allowed to prescribe marijuana and other drugs to patients with legitimate medical conditions.

"A lot of these people are suffering from a serious illness, and they're not getting the proper treatment for that," Vicente said. "The law does not allow the FDA to come in and say, 'You can't sell this' or 'You can't give this to these patients.'"

To make matters worse, the FDA's approval of marijuana in 1996 when it was still illegal also created a loophole that has been exploited by companies that are no longer producing the drug.

"The whole reason that cannabis was put on Schedule I was to prevent it from entering into the marketplace," Vicente said. "But what they don't realize is that there are a lot of companies that have grown and are producing it that are not on Schedule I."

In 1996, the DEA placed marijuana on Schedule I, meaning that it is not considered safe and effective and has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This means that there are no regulations requiring that marijuana be tested and regulated for safety and efficacy.

Vicente said that the DEA's policy of not regulating marijuana creates an environment that is ripe for abuse, and that has led to a proliferation of dispensaries that don't adhere to the same safety standards as other businesses.

"The DEA has no authority to police it," he said. "If they did, it would bring a lot of problems."

The fact that marijuana is scheduled in the first place has led to a number of lawsuits filed by patients and medical marijuana providers. In one of the more notable recent cases, a federal judge in California ordered the DEA to reclassify the drug. The judge said that marijuana has been proven to be medically beneficial, and thus should be classified as a Schedule III drug, which means it would be subject to more rigorous regulation.

A similar case was filed in Maryland by a group of medical marijuana patients. In that case, a federal

Story highlights "I'm not a politician," Trump said

Trump said he would have released his tax returns if he were running for president

Washington (CNN) Donald Trump said Wednesday that he's not a politician and argued that he's too smart to release his tax returns.

"I'm not a politician. I'm not going to release my tax returns until, maybe, the audit is finished, but I'm not going to do it until the audit is finished," Trump said at a news conference in Washington.

Trump has insisted that he will not release his returns because he is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service.

Earlier Wednesday, a CNNMoney analysis found that Trump could have paid up to $38 million in taxes on income of up to $150 million over the past 15 years.

Trump also tried to answer a question about his personal finances during the press conference.

The Progressive Conservative leader says the money, which the Liberals say will come from the province's deficit, will be used to win a new contract and for the creation of a new union.

Wynne has said she wants to avoid the kind of bitter dispute that was sparked by the government's 2012 decision to cut the provincial pension plan.

"We will not stand idly by and let a union break the law or come to an impasse with the government," Wynne said Wednesday.

The province has already spent about $200-million on contracts for the province's public sector workers, and Wynne said she wants to avoid another protracted dispute.

Moreover, she criticized the Liberals for a decision in February to cap the maximum amount of sick leave a worker can take at 26 days.

"Cutting the maximum work week to 26 hours is a decision that is causing real pain to people in this province," Wynne said.

Wynne said the Liberals also want to negotiate a new contract for the province's 10,000 police officers and Crown prosecutors.

"We will not stand idly by and let a union break the law or come to an impasse with the government."

The Liberals have already started bargaining with the Ontario Public Service Employees Union.

There are currently 1,500 government workers who are members of the OPEU.

The Liberals have not said how much they're willing to spend on the new union, but Wynne said they'll be "honest" about what they want to negotiate.

"We are putting home a proposal that is fair to the community, fair to the public service and fair to the public sector," Wynne said.<|endoftext|>Image copyright AFP Image caption The death toll has risen to 29

The death toll from a landslide in northern Thailand has risen to 29, officials say.

The landslide, in a remote area of Narathiwat province, is believed to have been triggered by heavy rain in recent days.

The landslide is near a water reservoir but it is not clear if the reservoir was affected.

The landslide is the latest in a series of massive landslides in Thailand's northern areas.

The landslide happened in a remote area of Narathiwat, where local villagers live close to a water reservoir.

"The landslide has pushed a mound of dirt and mud down, burying people who were trying to dig it out," Narathiwat deputy chief of police Preecha Achara told the BBC.

One teenager was found dead on Saturday, but it is not known if he was buried by mud, officials said.

"Our search team has found at least 28 bodies so far," said Narathiwat deputy chief of police Preecha Achara.

The landslide happened in a mountainous area of a remote part of the province, near the village of Khorat.

Thai officials said the area had not been hit by major floods in recent years, and that the landslide was not related to the annual floods.

Health Minister Jane Philpott says she's confident the law will be passed in time for summer driving season, which begins later this month.

"We do believe that it is a very serious problem and we have to do something. It's just not acceptable for anyone to be distracting while driving," Philpott said Monday at a news conference in Ottawa.

Drivers who want to use a cellphone while driving have to keep their hands on the steering wheel or the brake pedals and remain within a phone's range of hearing and sight.

"We are providing that protection to drivers in this country, and I'm very confident that we will get this change through," said Philpott.

Similar legislation has been introduced in other countries, including Australia, Britain, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand.

Some provinces have introduced their own laws, but the proposed federal law would be the first to deal with the widespread problem of distracted driving. (CBC)

The proposed legislation would allow police to seize smartphones from drivers who have been caught using them.

Philpott says the government is also prepared to introduce a separate law to deal with drivers who fail to provide proof of insurance or are caught driving with a suspended licence, a charge that can carry a fine of up to $250.

"We're also making sure that we're doing everything we can to make sure that anyone who is caught using a cellphone while driving is assessed by the courts," she said.

'Not alone'

Tina MacKinnon, director of communications for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, welcomed the new legislation.

"I think we're all concerned and I think it's a great idea," she said.

"It's something that's more common than we think. When you're on the road and the cellphone is in your hand, it's easy to use it and it's a lot harder to stop."

In Canada, there are an estimated 95 deaths each year and roughly 33,000 injuries due to distracted driving.

The proposed federal law would be the first to deal with the widespread problem of distracted driving, which is now being called a public health problem. (CBC) "I think it's a great idea," said MacKinnon, who also uses a cellphone while driving.

"I haven't used a cellphone in two years, but I can imagine that someone I know, someone I work with, a family member, someone I know, maybe a friend or a colleague — I can imagine that this is something that they do."

MADD Canada has been lobbying the government for years to make it illegal to text and drive.

"It's so easy to do and it's so dangerous," MacKinnon said. "People don't recognize the dangers that they're putting themselves in, so we're worried about it and we're going to make sure that this isn't allowed."

The proposed federal law would be the first to deal with distracted driving.

The legislation, which has been referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, intends to include the use of hand-held electronic devices by drivers who are not otherwise impaired.

It also would include "any other form of wireless communications device" that may distract drivers, such as Bluetooth headsets, iPods or other Bluetooth-enabled devices, as well as GPS devices or "any other device that may cause the driver to break concentration."<|endoftext|>BANGALORE: The Karnataka government has started a programme to make all government schools double the standard of teaching, which will help in gender parity in the profession.

It was a Wednesday morning in March, and a man named Jerome Corsi was working as a research fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford. He had been invited to speak at the university's Hoover Institution on the topic of "The Great Challenge of Our Time."

"I had been invited to speak to the Hoover Institution on the topic of the Great Challenge of Our Time," Corsi told TIME, "and to the Hoover Institute and Stanford University for that matter have been trying to get me to do this for the past nine months."

Corsi was checking in from San Francisco when he received a call from the university. He was told to come to the Hoover Institution's office at 6:40 a.m. He was arrested for trespassing.

"It was just one of those things that happened," he said of the arrest. "It was just one of those things that happens."

Corsi, a former Hoover Institution fellow, was released after a few hours.

The next day, he filed a federal lawsuit accusing the university of violating his civil rights.

"When the Hoover Institution is not free to speak as it wishes, it harms students' rights to free expression and research," the lawsuit reads. "Moreover, the Hoover Institution's conduct represents an egregious violation of the First Amendment."

The suit also claims that the university failed to investigate Corsi's allegations about a former employee who provided him with a copy of a confidential document.

The university had not responded to requests for comment by TIME when the suit was filed.

Corsi says he was not given a chance to question the person who brought him to the university's office.

"I was denied the opportunity to ask any questions about the person who was in charge of the department that Boren was in," Corsi told TIME.

In a statement to TIME, the university said that it had not been served with the lawsuit and its lawyers were reviewing it.

"The University of California is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer," the statement reads. "Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is a violation

"The demand for online education is growing, and the industry is starting to find ways to reduce the costs," says Torsten Stoeckle, the ITU's head of business services and information.

"A good example is the growing number of short courses, where students can complete their courses in a couple of weeks, without the need for a degree," he told the BBC.

The ITU says that the number of students enrolled in courses has grown by 29% in the past year.

The organisation estimates that the US alone has more than 50,000 students in long-term courses, a number expected to increase dramatically in the coming years.

"The US is the largest market for online education," says Mr Stoeckle, "but there are also many other countries where this type of education is seen as an option."

International students

In the US alone, there are over one million international students, according to the ITU.

One-quarter of these students are studying in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, but the most popular courses are in the humanities and social sciences.

Globalisation and changing demographics are also driving the demand, says Mr Stoeckle: "The number of people in their 20s and beyond studying in the US is also increasing, and some of these students are switching to studies in other countries."

More than half of the students in STEM courses are studying in the US, while the rest are concentrated in Europe, Asia and Australia.

"These students are interested in pursuing a career outside the US, and this is also an important factor in the growth of online education," says Mr Stoeckle.

The number of students studying in the humanities and social sciences increased by 43% in the last year, according to the ITU.

"This is a result of the changing demographics of the population in the US," says Mr Stoeckle.

"The number of people aged between 20 and 39 has increased by 150% over the past 20 years, while the number of students aged between and 60 has increased by 120%."

Despite this, the number of students studying in the humanities and social sciences has still not kept pace with the number of students studying in the STEM disciplines.

"There are many people in the US who want to learn a trade or a skill for their future, so they are choosing to study in these disciplines, but there is still a long way to go," says Mr Stoeckle.

The ITU says that there are now more students studying in the humanities and social sciences than there are in the STEM disciplines.

The number of students studying in the STEM disciplines was estimated to be just under 800,000 in 2013, but the ITU says that figure is expected to rise to 2.6 million students by 2021.

"The growth of online education will be a key factor in reducing the cost of education," says Mr Stoeckle.<|endoftext|>Twitter is a great place to keep up with everything that's happening in the world. It's where you can stay up to date with the latest news and updates, the day's trending topics, and more. It's also where you can use the platform to share your opinion on issues like racism and sexism.

One of the most controversial topics to come up in the past few months on Twitter has been the #Gamergate controversy. That is, the movement started by a few disgruntled game developers who are concerned about the portrayal of women in video games.

Before we get to the reasons why people hate #Gamergate, we have to understand a few things about the people involved in the movement. The people behind #Gamergate are a group of hardcore gamers who dislike the way that modern video games portray women. That's right, #Gamergate is a group of gamers who feel that video games are sexist. They believe that games have become so sexist that they are not even fun anymore. Some of the criticisms leveled at video games are that there are too many female characters, that they are too sexualized, and that they are too overly sexualized.

In other words, #Gamergate is a group of people who are upset that they feel that video games are getting too sexualized.

Other people who have taken part in the harassment of women in the video games industry are several people with a specific viewpoint who refer to their actions

The newly-established French suburb of Avignon is gaining a reputation for emergency response.

After the Paris attacks last November, the French government offered to build a new suburb just 300 metres from the city centre to house the victims and their emergency services.

Avignon, which has a population of about 7,500, has already become a source of controversy.

The government has faced a barrage of criticism for the lack of green space in the suburb, as well as for excessive police presence and controversial planning.

Now, the government has announced plans to make Avignon even more secure.

The government has announced plans to build an underground tunnel under the city centre, connecting the city to Avignon, which will allow the police and fire services to work 24/7, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

The tunnel is expected to cost around €60 million (£54 million).

The government says the tunnel will help the police to better respond to emergencies.

However, Avignon residents have raised concerns over the amount of traffic that will be created by the tunnel.

So far some residents are concerned that the tunnel will cause traffic jams and slow down traffic.

The tunnel is expected to be finished by 2020.<|endoftext|>The number of people in the UK who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease has risen by almost a quarter in three years, new figures show.

The number of people diagnosed with dementia has trebled over the past six years, with the number of people with dementia expected to top one million by 2050.

The latest figures show that 6.3 per cent of adults in the UK have been diagnosed with dementia – up from 3.6 per cent in 2010.

Around 41,000 people in England are now living with dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Society.

Of these, 1.6 million people are living with the condition in the UK – a rise of 400,000 since 2010.

Alzheimer's disease, which affects around five in every 100 people, is the most common form of dementia.

It is estimated that around 4.2 million people in the UK will develop dementia in their lifetime – with the figure expected to rise to one million by 2050.

Experts say the number of elderly people diagnosed with mental health conditions is also increasing.

Alzheimer's UK's chief executive, Dr Philip Sinclair, said: "While the UK population is ageing, the number of people with dementia is increasing.

"The number of people living with mental health conditions is also increasing."

He added that dementia affects a wide range of people in all age groups.

"There's no single cause of dementia, but genetic and environmental factors are likely to play a part," he said.

"Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia in the UK, so it's important to get early diagnosis and support for people who are at risk of developing the condition."

The Alzheimer's Society said the figures show the need for increased efforts to promote better understanding of dementia and its impact on individuals and families.

Dementia UK chief executive, Polly Neate, said: "These figures make clear that more needs to be done to raise awareness of this disease, and to better understand its impact on people and communities."

Dementia UK also has a pledge to end dementia by 2050, and an earlier diagnosis and treatment for people who are at risk of developing dementia.

The charity said that by 2050, one in every two people in the UK will have dementia and more than half of people with dementia will have Alzheimer's.

Dementia UK's pledge to end dementia by 2050, and an earlier diagnosis and treatment for people who are at risk of developing dementia, is set out in the campaign.<|endoftext|>Posted on by steveblank

There are some things that happen in life that are just so surprising, you probably don't know how they happened… and then, once you know, you wonder how you ever lived without them. They're like the ultimate, life-changing surprises.

But these are some of the most unbelievable things that happen for at least one of these people in a single day.

1) Michael Jackson's Arrest

Michael Jackson was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department on December 23rd, 1978 during an investigation into allegations of underage prostitution and drug possession. The police found a large amount of marijuana in his home and a large amount of cocaine. He was taken to jail and then released on $50,000 bail.

2) The Roman Polanski and Roman Polanski Film

The Roman Polanski film, Rosemary's Baby, is a cult classic of the horror genre. It was the basis for a television movie, Rosemary's Baby, starring Sharon Tate, and the film was also the basis for a graphic novel, and several other films.

Housing

The housing market in the United States is a complex and dynamic system. The most important aspects of housing are the supply and demand for housing, the structure of housing, and the characteristics of the individual housing unit. The housing market is governed by a number of interrelated factors including land use regulations, the supply of land, the demand for housing, and the structure of housing. These factors, in turn, are influenced by the overall economic and financial status of the nation.

The Residential Construction Industry

The residential construction industry in the United States is primarily based on the construction of single family detached homes. The industry is largely comprised of homeowners who are facing a decreased demand for single family homes due to the fact that the housing market is saturated. The supply of housing units is an important factor influencing the housing market as more housing units are typically required to support a higher demand for housing.

The Housing Market, Demand and Supply

The United States has seen an increase in the number of households since the mid-1990s. The number of households has increased by approximately 6.3 percent per year over the last three decades, and by approximately 20 percent per year over the last ten years. In the mid-1990s, the housing market was experiencing a boom in home sales. The real estate industry experienced a surge in the number of transactions in the early 1990s, and the number of sales increased steadily throughout the 1990s. During the early part of the 2000s, the housing market experienced a sharp slowdown, as home sales and the construction of single family homes were both at a near-record low for the time period. Consequently, the housing market had a difficult time recovering from the downturn in the early 2000s.

In the past 25 years, there has been a noticeable decrease in the number of single family homes sold in the United States. However, the number of single family homes sold has been steadily increasing since the mid-1990s. During the early 2000s, the number of single family homes sold was on par with the number of single family homes sold in the early 1990s, but by the end of the decade, the number of single family homes sold was over 20 percent lower than the number of single family homes sold in the mid 1990s.

In 2012, there were approximately 2.7 million single family home sales in the United States. The home ownership rate was approximately 64 percent at the end of 2012, and the median home value was approximately $211,000.

The demand for housing is the key driver of the housing market. As demand for housing increases, the availability of housing decreases, leading to a decrease in the housing supply. The housing supply is affected by several factors including construction and demolition activity, and other factors including the availability and cost of land.

Land Use Regulation

Land use regulation is a key factor in the housing market as it regulates the construction of new residential and commercial structures. Land use regulation is a complex and dynamic regulatory system that regulates land use throughout the United States. Land use regulation is divided into four major types:

Zoning

Municipal land use planning

State-level land use planning

Coordination of state and local governments

Zoning

The zoning system is divided into four major groups:

Neighborhood planning

Urban renewal

Cities and towns

Community planning

The zoning system is divided into two main groups, general and special. General zoning is a land-use regulation that governs the whole of the area of the area of land in the area of land. Special zoning is a land-use regulation that regulates a specific parcel or a specific area of land. General zoning is regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Special zoning is regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Municipal Land Use Planning

Municipal land use planning is a basic land-use regulation that governs the entire municipal area of the area of land. Municipalities are responsible for the zoning of municipal land use planning areas. Municipalities are also required to establish and enforce land use regulations. The land-use planning process in municipalities differs from the land use planning process in county or state government.

State-level Land Use Planning

State-level land use planning is a land-use regulation that governs a specific parcel of land within a specific boundaries of a state. The land use planning process in a state differs from the land use planning process in a county or state government.

Coordination of State and Local Governments

Coordination of state and local governments is a land-use regulation that governs the coordination of land use regulations within a state. State governments have the most authority in implementing land use regulations and are responsible for regulating the entire area of land within their boundaries. State governments are responsible for determining the zoning and planning regulations for state-wide land use planning areas. State governments are also responsible for the coordination of land use regulations within their

I'm a massive fan of the Uncharted series. I've spent more time playing Uncharted games than probably anyone else. And I'm glad I did.

The Uncharted series is unique. Not just in the way it has a consistent story, but in the way it manages to be both entertaining and challenging at the same time.

The Uncharted series is so good because it manages to balance out the tension between tight action and great storytelling.

The series never fools around when it comes to challenge. In each Uncharted game, it takes you on an adventure that is both thrilling and challenging.

In Uncharted 2, there's a huge open world to explore. You can go anywhere, do anything, and meet anyone.

But the action in the game is never overbearing. It's always at a manageable level.

The action in Uncharted 3 is even more intense. You're constantly on the defensive, constantly trying to avoid being knocked down.

But there's always a way out. If you can keep your cool, you can keep your life.

And the story is incredibly engaging. Every time you see a new character, you're taken back to that moment in your life when you first met them.

The games have some of the best and most memorable moments of their entire series. And the best part is that it doesn't feel like a chore to play them.

While there are some games that are just better at the game of Uncharted, there's no reason to think that Uncharted is any less fun than any other Uncharted game.

But my favorite part of the Uncharted series is something that nobody talks about.

The core gameplay.

 Uncharted games are all about the gameplay.

The Uncharted games have beautiful art. The games are filled with gadgets and gadgets. The games are filled with weapons and weapons. Every level is filled with knuckle-busting action.

But the gameplay is what makes Uncharted so fun.

With every Uncharted game, you're constantly challenged to do something new.

There are no incremental upgrades in Uncharted. There are no upgrades to your weapons or your gadgets.

You can earn new weapons and gadgets by completing levels.

You can earn new gadgets and weapons by earning XP.

You can earn XP by completing levels. And you can earn XP by doing everything in the game.

Every level is filled with tons of things to do. And every level is filled with tons of things to see.

The Uncharted games are filled with tons of things to do. And every level is filled with tons of things to see.

And while the gameplay is the main draw of Uncharted games, the story is just as important.

The Uncharted series is filled with incredible characters. They're all amazing. They're all interesting. And they all have their own personal stories to tell.

But one of my favorite characters is Nadine Ross. She's amazing. And she's tragic.

Nadine Ross is the type of character that I'd love to see in every game that is created.

Her character is so complex. Her story is so compelling. And it's so easy to get behind her.

Nadine Ross is the type of character that I'd love to see in every game that is created.

The Uncharted series has one of the most imbalanced skill systems out there.

The game has dozens of guns, grenades, and gadgets.

But almost every single weapon is the same. Almost every gadget is the same.

You can't pick up a gun or a gadget and be surprised by the way it works. Every weapon and every gadget is the same.

And that's a problem.

It's a problem because it's so easy to get bored of the gameplay. It's so easy to get bored of the weapons and the gadgets.

As Germany continues to grapple with a mass shooting, Berlin's main Christmas market, Breitscheidplatz, has turned into a crime scene. Police say they are investigating a number of suspects, with some even saying there is evidence that the incident is "ISIS-related."

The Berlin market attack has been dubbed as a "Christmas market attack" by CNN. In Germany, the word "attack" is used when a person is involved in a crime. However, it is often used to describe crimes that are claimed to be carried out by Islamist terrorists, such as the attack in Paris in January.

Police have not confirmed the exact details of the attack, but the Federal Police have taken over the investigation from the Berlin's state police. The Berlin police were overwhelmed by the number of injuries and it took them several hours before they were able to secure the area.

German police have also confirmed that an Islamic State Flag was found at the scene, as well as a bomb-making manual.

Berlin police have also confirmed that the suspected attacker, a Tunisian-born 19-year-old, had been previously in contact with Islamic State members.

A member of the Berlin's elite counter-terrorism unit said that the suspect was "a loner, non-conformist, who was extremely radicalized by the internet." He added that the suspect "had been radicalizing himself since 2015," when he was "taken in by an Islamist preacher in Berlin."

The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the Obama administration is backing off a plan to close Guantanamo Bay after a public outcry that pitted human rights advocates against the president.

President Obama had promised to close the detention facility within his first year in office. But in an Oct. 1 speech, he said that the United States would only move detainees into the United States.

ADVERTISEMENT

"In the coming months, I will continue to push Congress to pass the defense bill, which will help us close the prison in Cuba and take the pressure off Washington to do more," Obama said.

"But there are few good options for sending detainees to the United States. I will work with Congress to find a way to keep this facility open, and I will not sign any bill that blocks our efforts to close it."

But that's precisely what some human rights groups had been demanding, and Tuesday evening, they began lobbying Obama to keep the prison open.

"The administration should continue to push for a new location for the facility, one that is more than five miles from populated areas and over an hour's drive from the United States," said Nihad Awad, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project. "Placing detainees in a rural area is unacceptable, and it would be better for our national security interests to use the military prison at the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba."

"I hope that the administration will quickly reverse course and make good on President Obama's promise to close Guantanamo," added Awad.

The White House said in a statement that it had received "overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle" for closing the prison.

"The president has been clear that we have no intention of spending any additional taxpayer dollars to reopen this facility. The president has made clear that he will not sign any legislation that blocks our efforts to close this facility," the White House said. "This is a decision that President Obama reached after careful consideration and consultation with his national security team, as well as with many members of Congress, and it is consistent with his long-standing commitment to close this facility."

Obama has engaged in a public relations campaign to push for the prison's closure, and last week he called for a "full review" of his promise to close the prison.

"I know it's been a difficult topic for a lot of Americans, and they are going to be anxious about where they're going to be kept," Obama told CBS News. "And that's why the president is going to be facing a lot of questions."

The White House said the review will look for "alternative locations" for the prison to house detainees.

"We'll be meeting with officials from the administration and Congress to share our options and our plans and to get feedback," said White House press secretary Josh Earnest.<|endoftext|>This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to the speculation over whether President Obama will run for re-election in 2012. On Tuesday, the White House said Obama will not make a decision on 2016 until after the midterm elections. The spokesman said Obama is focused on showing he is prepared to lead the country during the next two years.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We can't hide from this fact. We can't pretend that we're not seeing these hard truths about our politics, and that is why we're going to have to make some tough choices. Some of those choices may not be popular, but they're the right choices to make.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined by the author of the new book, Grand New Party: The Making of the New Democratic Majority. His latest piece is headlined "Obama Will Not Run for President in 2016." It's written by Al Cross, who's a political reporter for the Houston Chronicle, the largest newspaper in Texas, and is a longtime political reporter for the New York Times. He's also a former conservative political journalist and columnist for the New York Daily News. His latest reporting on the 2012 presidential election is headlined "Not Run, Not Hide: Obama's Battle with Bill Clinton After Republicans' Tanked '12 Defeat."

Welcome, Al. Talk about what you found.

AL CROSS: Well, Amy, I've been writing about Obama for a long time, and I've been waiting for him to make this decision. And I figure, you know, we're in the middle of the campaign and the primaries are underway, and, you know, it's probably in his interest to, not only make the best decision he can make for the country, but to do it during the middle of the campaign. And, you know, I think the decision was made that maybe he should wait. And I think that was the right decision. I think that after the primaries are over, and the Republican primary is over, and the Democratic primary is over, and the general election is over,

The CBO got it right the first time: the Senate Republicans' plan will reduce the deficit by $1.5 trillion.

The CBO predicts that the Senate GOP plan will cut the deficit $1.5 trillion. ( J. Scott Applewhite / AP )

But the $1.5 trillion is based on the assumption that the Senate plan will actually pass. That is unlikely to happen, since President Donald Trump is much more likely to sign the bill than Senate Republicans are to pass it. But the CBO still got it right. The Congressional Budget Office released an analysis of the Senate GOP tax plan, which would reduce the deficit by $1.5 trillion over a decade. The report, which was released Monday, is the first estimate of the Senate's tax bill by the independent, nonpartisan agency.

Article Continued Below

The report found that the bill would increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, on top of the $1 trillion deficit that the government is projected to run over the next decade under current law. The Senate's plan would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 20 per cent, eliminate the estate tax and lower the top individual rate from 39.6 per cent to 37 per cent. This would cost more than $1 trillion in lost revenue over 10 years. The report also said that the Senate's plan would increase the deficit by $1.4 trillion over 10 years, on top of the $1 trillion deficit that the government is projected to run over the next decade under current law. The report said that the bill would reduce the deficit by $1.1 trillion over a decade, due to its lower deficits relative to the income taxes paid by high-income individuals. But to get to the $1.5 trillion savings, the Senate bill would have to add a similar amount in interest costs over the next decade.

The CBO report comes about two weeks after the release of the House Republican tax plan, which would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 21.5 per cent, eliminate the estate tax and cut the top individual rate from 39.6 per cent to 37 per cent. The Republican plan would reduce the deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, according to the report. The Senate version plans to cut the deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, according to the CBO.

The CBO report is based on the assumption that the Senate plan will pass, which is unlikely to happen. Senate Republicans have tried to pass the bill once, but it has failed several times. The House plan is expected to pass in the coming weeks.<|endoftext|>It's probably too late for a Kickstarter to get a Kickstarter-funded game onto PC, but it's not too late for a Kickstarter to not be a Kickstarter.

This was the case with "The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot," a Kickstarter-funded game that has been taken down by the developers.

The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot is a PC roguelike RPG, in which you play as a hired mercenary to loot, pillage, and murder your way through dungeons. It looks like a roguelike, which is why it was funded by a Kickstarter. The developers celebrated its success with a free update, which added new weapons to the game, along with new characters. Then things went south.

The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot's Kickstarter page has been taken down by the developers, who have apologized in a comment on the game's page. Here's the full quote, from the developer:

"We have decided to take down our Kickstarter campaign for "The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot" because of the recent negative publicity surrounding the game. This was a very difficult decision, and we regret that this has caused concern to some of our backers. We would like to offer a sincere apology to all the backers, and thank you all for your understanding and patience. We are working tirelessly to get the game out to all of our backers and we hope to be able to resume this campaign soon. We hope this will be the end of this story."

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today's show looking at the often overlooked issue of racial profiling. FBI statistics show black suspects are more than twice as likely as white suspects to receive a criminal arrest, and the rate of racial profiling has spiked since the 2008 election of the first African-American president. This is FBI Director Robert Mueller.

ROBERT MUELLER: We've seen a rise in racial profiling. I mean, we've seen an increase in the number of investigations in which ethnicities were not targeted, where ethnicities were not the focus of the investigation.

AMY GOODMAN: That was FBI Director Robert Mueller, speaking to the House Judiciary Committee last week. This is a clip of his statement.

ROBERT MUELLER: And—and I think it's also important to note that when community members are stopped, the majority of those stops are not of persons who are suspected of a crime, but of persons who are simply walking down the street, and sometimes they're stopped because they're not wearing a seatbelt or because they're an unlicensed driver. And we know that racial profiling can lead to unjustified stops.

AMY GOODMAN: That was FBI Director Robert Mueller speaking to the House Judiciary Committee last week. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division also released a report last week saying that blacks are more than three times as likely as white people to be stopped and searched at police stops.

To talk more about this, we'll be joined by two guests. Dave Zirin is a columnist for The Nation and author of the new book, The David Horowitz Freedom Center: Unmasking the Left's War on America. His most recent piece for The Nation is headlined "FBI Director Mueller: "Racial Profiling" Is Not a Thing." And as our guest, Dave Zirin, will be joining us from Wilmington, Delaware, we'll also be joined by Derrick Johnson, a national spokesperson for the Black Lives Matter movement.

We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Dave Zirin, let's begin with you. You were a student of Robert Mueller as a student at Boston University, right?

DAVE ZIRIN: Yes.

AMY GOODMAN: And what did you think of his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee?

DAVE ZIRIN: Well, I think he was fair, and I think he was honest, and I think he was forthright. The truth is that himself and other law enforcement officials, not just in the United States, but in many other countries around the world, have acknowledged that they've been profiling people of color and using their race in their decision-making. In this country, the FBI has admitted that they've been doing this for decades. And it's a practice that has been done with the consent and approval of the Department of Justice, and that the Department of Justice has said that they've been trying to end for a long time, and have said that they've tried to end it.

AMY GOODMAN: Dave Zirin, can you talk about Derrick Johnson, the national spokesperson for the Black Lives Matter movement?

DAVE ZIRIN: Well, Derrick is a professor at Princeton University who has been organizing with the Black Lives Matter movement. And as he said in his article, this is an issue that he's been working on for years. And what we see with the FBI and the Department of Justice is that they're not really trying to end the practice that they've been engaging in for a long time. And it's a practice that's been going on since the '60s, and has been a practice of law enforcement and the Department of Justice, and that they've been quietly working on to end for years.

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask you about the issue of the Ferguson dispute. Last week, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said it would reopen its investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. This is Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III.

JAMES KNOWLES III: We're going to continue to fight for justice, and we're going to continue to fight for transparency. And as long as we're fighting for transparency and accountability, we're going to continue to do it.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III. Your response, Dave?

DAVE ZIRIN: Well, Ferguson is a city in St. Louis County. They made the decision to stop collecting data on racial profiling in Ferguson, and they've been able to close that down. So, if you're a community member who just wants to know if your police department is doing an effective job of stopping racial profiling, you can't go to the police department. You have to go to the mayor's office. You can't go to the police department. You have to go to the city council. And you have to go to Ferguson. And this is a

7:55 p.m.

The Texas Senate is advancing a bill that would outlaw so-called sanctuary cities and limit state cooperation with immigration authorities.

Senate Bill 4 would bar localities from enacting policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration officers on immigration matters. The legislation also requires localities to provide information about people arrested for immigration violations to federal authorities. It would also require localities to turn over information on noncitizens who are arrested.

The legislation passed the Senate Public Safety Committee on a 16-9 vote. It now heads to the Senate floor.

The bill's sponsor, Sen. Charles Perry, has said a criminal immigration enforcement strategy is not needed in Texas. He says Texas is already among the most immigrant-friendly states in the nation.

Perry says the legislation is needed to protect Texans.

By The Associated Press - BRUNSWICK, Maine (AP) - Maine's highest court has ruled that a transgender woman can legally change her name and gender marker on her driver's license, a victory for a New York resident who had been denied the change.

The Maine Supreme Judicial Court on Friday rejected arguments by the Maine Department of Public Safety that her name and gender marker on her driver's license should not be changed because she is not legally male.

Lawyers for Angela Milne argue that the Maine state law on driver's licenses does not recognize a transsexual's gender identity.

Milne was born a man and underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2010.

Maine law allows a person to change his or her name on the driver's license but not the gender marker.

In a 2-1 decision by the court, justices said the state law should be interpreted as recognizing a person's gender identity.

The Maine DMV will have until Sept. 30, 2019, to change the license. The court did not specify what penalties the department could face if it fails to do so.

This Story Filed Under<|endoftext|>This article is about the location in the town of Southport. For the class, see Dwarf (class).

Southport is a town in the game.

Contents show]

Background Edit

Southport is a small city in the northern part of the Isle of Wight. Southport is a large town with a lot of shops and other buildings, as well as a cemetery with a lot of graves. Southport has a lot of smiths and other tradesmen, as well as a town hall. It is also where the Dorgeshuun wizard Quirk and his apprentice are located.

Characteristics Edit

Southport, like all towns in The Sims 3, is run by a mayor, who is a Sim. He is able to make appointments for the Town Council. Southport has four districts: North, South, East and West. The mayor has the power to appoint the members of the Town Council. The mayor has the power to elect a member of the Town Council, but only on the first day of the month. The mayor is only able to make appointments during the Business Week.

Southport has a few buildings, including the town hall, a church, a gazebo and a cemetery. The town hall is the center of the town. The mayor has the ability to call the town meeting, where citizens can discuss issues with the mayor (a Sim who can be hired from the town.) Its appearance has been changed slightly, with a new red coat of arms above the letters, and a new red door. The town hall has an upstairs area, which holds the kitchen and dining room. There is also a library, which has a bookcase with bookshelves. There is also a library with a desk, which has a desk lamp and a bookshelf. The library has a skeleton in the middle of the room, and the bookshelf on the left has a skeleton on top of it. The library has a skeleton on top of it.

The 2013-14 season has been a rollercoaster for the New York Islanders.

While they were the first to be eliminated from the playoffs, the Islanders have struggled to find chemistry on the ice.

In 2012-13, the Islanders ranked 26th in goals per game (2.54) and 27th in goals against per game (2.95).

In 2013-14, the Isles ranked 24th in goals per game (2.48) and 21st in goals against per game (2.99).

Despite all this, general manager Garth Snow still believes this team has the potential to have success.

"I think we've got a good nucleus of young, talented players, and I think we're going to be a really good team in the future," Snow told Newsday's Steve Politi on Tuesday.

Snow, who was hired in April 2013, said he doesn't believe the instability and inconsistency within the organization has affected the Islanders' ability to win.

"We've got a very good coach, and we've got a good system in place," Snow said.

Snow believes the Islanders need to improve their power play. The Islanders are currently 25th in the NHL with an 11.8 percent success rate, which is below the league average of 13.6 percent.

"Our power play has been very inconsistent, and I think that's because we haven't had the success we'd like to," Snow said.

The Islanders have a few players who could help on the power play. Defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky, the Isles' top defenseman, is tied for 26th in the NHL with a +15 on the power play.

Video: Tavares, Tavares, Tavares, Tavares get to the net for a goal

Captain John Tavares is tied for ninth in the NHL with 12 goals on the power play, and he has been a dangerous weapon for the Isles. Tavares has seven power-play goals, which is tied for sixth in the NHL.

Tavares' nine power-play goals are the most among all active NHL players.

"I think it starts with the work ethic," Snow said. "I think it starts with the guys coming to practice. I think it starts with the coaching staff taking pride in coaching the power play and not just just giving it to the kids and expecting them to succeed."

While the Islanders are tied for fifth in the NHL with eight power-play goals, Snow said they need to use more discipline on the power play.

"I think it's getting more disciplined on the power play and getting creative," Snow said. "We've been putting a lot of pressure on the penalty kill and we need to be more creative with the power play."

Snow said he has no concerns about the difficulty of one-on-one situations for the Islanders' top players in the Western Conference, such as Alex Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby.

"From my perspective, we've got a really good top six and a really good top four in the middle," Snow said. "I think we're going to be a really good hockey team."

The Islanders open the 2014-15 season on Oct. 6 at the New York Islanders' home at Nassau Coliseum.

The Islanders also will play their first home game of the season on Oct. 14 against the Ottawa Senators. The six-game home stand begins on Oct. 19 when the Islanders host the Detroit Red Wings.

The Islanders will play their final game of the season on Oct. 22 against the Florida Panthers.<|endoftext|>This is the astonishing moment a passenger aboard a Malaysia Airlines flight fell off a tray table and landed on the plane's wing.

"Jared is a young, talented forward with good size who had a great season in Florida and we feel he can be a quality addition to our club," said Benning. "He is a goal scorer and will fit well with our team and the direction we're heading in. We're excited to welcome Jared to the Canucks family."

McCann, 24, has appeared in 62 games with the Panthers this season recording 19 points (9G-10A) and 16 penalty minutes. Over the past two seasons, McCann has registered 152 points (54G-100A) and 160 penalty minutes in 365 games. It will be the fourth consecutive season that McCann has played at least 60 games in a season and the first time since 2009-10.

The 6-1, 195-pound forward has played parts of seven seasons in the NHL, including four seasons with the Panthers. In his time with the Panthers, McCann has registered 82 points (41G-54A) and 118 penalty minutes.

McCann was originally selected by the Panthers in the first round (14th overall) of the 2007 NHL Entry Draft and has since appeared in 587 games in the NHL, amassing 383 points (134G-253A) and 337 penalty minutes. He has also skated in 33 career Stanley Cup Playoff games.

The New York Times reported late Friday that US officials were "very close" to determining that a grenade launcher was among the eight weapons that a group of US Special Forces soldiers were supposed to bring back from Afghanistan with them.

However, officials with knowledge of the investigation said that the weapon was never brought back. It remained unknown why the grenade launcher was never retrieved.

The Times said the decision to leave the grenade launcher behind in Afghanistan was made by the US military, not the Special Forces soldiers.

US Army officials declined to comment on the report.

A US official told The Times that the grenade launcher was still missing. The official said it was likely that the grenade launcher was captured by the Taliban during the mission to retrieve it.

The officials said the grenade launcher was supposed to be deployed alongside eight other weapons to help establish a forward operating base in Paktika province.

The official said the weapons were supposed to be returned to the Special Forces soldiers on June 3, but that it was unclear when the weapons were actually taken.

The Times report comes as the Pentagon continues to investigate whether the Fort Hood shooting on November 5 was an act of terrorism or an act of workplace violence.

President Obama has been criticized by Republicans for being slow to respond to the shooting.

The incident left 13 people dead, including the gunman, and wounded more than two dozen others.<|endoftext|>The BIA has released its first analysis of the cost to the public of the urban rail network.

The report was commissioned by the Department of Transport after the Government announced it would be spending more than £2 billion on the urban rail network and the rail industry lobby group said the figures were "alarming".

The report found that the modernisation of the railway network was costing the taxpayer £3.3 billion per year. Each year, the Government is paying around £1.6 billion towards the ongoing upgrade of the network.

The Government was also paying around £300 million per year in "cost of running costs" to run the railway and "fuel costs" of running trains.

The report added that the Government had committed to improving rail links in the South East. It estimated that the Government would spend around £1.5 billion per year on upgrading the railway network in the region over the next five years.

The report also said that the Government's commitment to electrification of the line between London and Birmingham was not expected to begin until 2021.

The report concluded that the Government had a "modest mandate" from voters for spending billions on the rail network and the rail industry lobby group,

Putin, who is also due to meet Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Saturday, said he had spoken to Trump about the possibility of a meeting, but that the leader of the world's two largest nuclear powers would need to have something concrete to discuss.

"I hope that we can meet in person in the next few months, and I would welcome such a meeting," Putin said in an interview with Rossiya 1 TV.

"I'm ready to meet the American president voluntarily. I think it will be a great pleasure to do so," he said.

Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Putin had spoken to Trump, but the Kremlin had not made any formal plans for the meeting.

"I think that the Americans were probably pleased to hear that," Peskov told reporters.

Francis will be joined by a small group of people, and will then deliver a homily at the Basilica of St. John Paul II.

The Mass will take place at 10 a.m. (3 a.m. ET), and will be televised live on the Vatican Radio website.

The pope is scheduled to celebrate Mass at St. John Paul II's tomb at the Basilica of St. John Paul II before heading to the Vatican's Vatican City residence for a private audience with the late Pope.

The Mass will be the first of two papal celebrations for the late Pope.

RELATED: Pope Francis' trip to Cuba and the United States

The Vatican announced Wednesday that Francis would hold a private audience with the late pope on May 19. The Vatican said the private audience would take place at a hotel in the Vatican.

Francis has been invited to the Vatican for an audience with the late Pope between May 19 and 22.

Francis has also been invited to the Vatican for an audience with the late Pope on May 6.

The Vatican has insisted that the private audience for the Pope with the late Pope Francis be considered a "private" one.

The Vatican repeatedly has stressed that Francis will not be receiving an audience with the late Pope from the late Pope.

The Vatican said the two popes are not "dignitaries" of the Roman Catholic Church.

Francis has said in the past that he wants to be able to "speak to the people directly."

The Vatican has said that Francis will not receive a private audience with the late Pope Francis from the late Pope.

"This is not a private meeting, but rather a meeting with the pope in his apostolic capacity," Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, told reporters in March.

Francis has met privately with the late Pope on only one other occasion — in February of 2013, when the two men came to the Vatican for the International Year of Faith.

In 2013, Francis said that the reason he had not met with Pope John XXIII was because John XXIII was not a pontiff.<|endoftext|>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. military will continue to operate in Iraq and Syria despite President Barack Obama's announcement Tuesday that he would keep the nation's combat troops there "indefinitely" if Congress fails to authorize the operation.

Obama announced his decision during a press conference from the White House briefing room, saying he had no choice but to act after Congress failed to approve funding for the campaign, which he said would have cost his administration more than $500 billion over the next 10 years.

"I will not allow a window of opportunity to open up for ISIL to plot and plan and execute their attacks against the United States and our allies and against our freedoms," Obama said.

"That's why I've directed my national security team to come up with a plan to take out ISIL, and protect our people before it's too late," he added.

The Chicago Sun-Times published an op-ed last month from a transgender individual, in which she explains the difficulty she has experienced navigating the dating scene. The woman, who identifies as a transgender woman, writes that she felt like she "was walking on eggshells" in her first months on the dating scene.

From the article:

In my first month on the dating scene, I was constantly being mistaken for a lesbian, and I didn't know how to react to that. I self-identified as a lesbian as a child and started to feel more comfortable dating men. But I didn't feel comfortable dating men who didn't consider me a woman, and it felt like walking on eggshells.

The article goes on to explain how she struggled with dating until she came out to her family. She explains how her mom couldn't understand why she was dating a man and ended up telling her, "It's not a big deal, and you won't regret it."

The article ends with the women's advice to other transgender individuals, including how they can tell if someone is transgender:

"If you're hanging out with people who try to manipulate you into thinking they're the "type" they'd like to be with, it's a sign you're not ready to date them," she said. "And if you're dating people who are genuinely interested in you, it's a sign you're not being taken advantage of."

The Sun-Times did not respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post.

This Story Filed Under<|endoftext|>The first season of "Arrow" has been a wild ride: The show has been accused of being too dark, too dark, and too dark, and it's even been called the "darkest, most brutal" superhero show on television. And while the show's producer admits that they didn't set out to be "dark," the show's latest season has been very dark indeed.

During a recent visit to the "Arrow" set, actor John Barrowman, who plays Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, spoke about the show's transition from the first season to the second. Fans of the comic book are likely familiar with the comic book villain Prometheus, who is the same name as the malevolent alien being that used to rule the island of Lian Yu. Barrowman was asked if he had any interest in playing the character, but he instead chose to focus on his upcoming role as the Red Hood in "Suicide Squad."

"I was going to say I had no interest in playing Prometheus, but that's a different story," Barrowman joked.

"Yeah, you did, but it's a different thing," Showrunner Wendy Mericle responded.

"It's a different story, obviously," Barrowman said.

"It's a really different story," Mericle said.

"You're doing a really dark character," Barrowman said.

"Yes, it's a really different point of view," Mericle said. "It's a lot more fun doing it, but it's hard."

"It's also really hard to pull it off," Barrowman said. "I think the fans are going to be really excited. They're going to be really happy that there's going to be a new direction for the show."

"I think they're going to be happy that there's a different tone, but it's a hard thing to pull off," Mericle said. "I'm really proud of what we've done, and I think the fans are going to be very happy about that."

Barrowman's co-star, Katie Cassidy, also spoke about the show's new direction. Cassidy said that the show is finally going back to its roots, which is something the fans have been asking for.

"There's a lot of cool things happening. It's a lot of fun, and it's not all dark, it's a lot of fun. My favorite idea that we have is that we have this very different show going on," Cassidy said.

"I think the fans are going to be really happy about that," Mericle said. "They're going to be excited that there's a different tone, but it's a hard thing to pull off. I'm really proud of what we've done, and I think the fans are going to be very happy about that."

Barrowman also commented about the end of the season, saying that it was "surreal."

"It was a really shocking ending, and it was really good," Barrowman said. "It was kind of like, 'What do we do now?'"

"It was a big deal, but I think it's a good thing. I think the writers are finally getting the chance to tell the complete story, and with the way the finale

Acid Rain

The great effluvia of India are in the air, as its climate is not very monsoon-like and the monsoon rains are generally quite sporadic, much less frequent than the areas around the northern part of India. Most of the rain is in the summer, and even during the hottest months, the rains are of very short duration. So, the water on the ground is very polluted. It is a very polluted water that is constantly being contaminated by micro-organisms and other chemicals. Especially, there is a great deal of industrial pollution in India, and this is particularly true in the cities. The consequences are very serious.

The air pollution can cause many serious diseases, such as lung diseases, bronchitis, asthma, killing very young people, particularly infants. It can also cause severe damage to the respiratory system, causing coughing, sneezing and respiratory infection, and can cause cardiovascular diseases. It can also cause cancer, respiratory diseases and other severe illnesses. Some of the most serious diseases that have been caused by the pollution are:

chronic bronchitis

lung cancer

lung or lung diseases

asthma

pneumonia

asthma or bronchitis

phimosis

night sweats

hyperactive thyroid

heart disease

The water pollution is equally serious. Many of the rivers and other water bodies in India are very polluted. They are polluted in particular by sewage and industrial waste, and also by the fertilizers and pesticides which are dumped on the fields.

The water is very dark, dirty, and so it attracts many different kinds of organisms. Especially, it attracts bacteria, protozoa, mollusks, and worm-like animals. The water in those areas is very clean and clean water is brought from a distant place. It is mixed with sewage or industrial waste, and this contributes to the pollution of the water bodies. The pollution of the water bodies is so serious that they are often covered with plant life, and the water often becomes toxic.

In that area, there are several rivers, but they are mostly polluted. The polluted rivers travel down to the sea. There are many harmful chemicals that are dumped on the fields to kill the plants, and the toxic plants die, or are eaten by other plants.

The pollution has also affected the riverbeds, and the water is very dirty and full of bacteria and other micro-organisms. The water is also very dirty and full of bacteria and other micro-organisms, and also attracts many kinds of plants. In the riverbeds, there are chemicals that are dumped on the fields to kill the plants, and the toxic plants die, or are eaten by other plants.

The pollution is in the air as well. The air in India has high levels of particulate matter, mainly from burning of coal and wood. The pollution is the result of the burning of these sources of pollution, and also is a result of the processing of the coal and the burning of the wood.

The acid rain is a result of this pollution, and is caused by the burning of coal and wood. This is a form of pollution that is very serious because it is a form of acid rain.

Feature to expand upon.

This is a blog about what it's like to live in a manosphere community. I'm not here to talk about the specifics of manosphere dating, how to pick a wife, or what to do about a woman you find unattractive. My goal is to provide a platform for the discussion of men's issues so that we can understand each other a little better.

I don't have a lot of experience writing about men's issues, but here are a few topics I imagine will interest you:

Why is it called the "Manosphere"?

There are actually two "manospheres": The "Real Manosphere." and the "Manosphere." I have been in both of them for a while, but I've not been a member of the Real Men's Movement for quite some time. My new blog is the Real Manosphere blog, and I'm going to try to rebrand it as a long-form, critical blog.

When I first started writing about the Manosphere, I did so not to distinguish it from the Real Men's Movement, but rather to differentiate it from a lot of the other blogs where I read.

I still like to check out the Real Men's Movement blog, but I think it's pretty obvious that there are several blogs that are better than mine. They tend to be more analytical, they do a better job of talking about men's issues, they're more visible, and they're more well-known.

Why do I focus on women?

Because I think women are the central issue in the life of every man. Most men don't really understand why they are attracted to women. But I do. I think most men have internalized the idea that women are "weak" and "submissive" and they need to be rescued by a strong man who will make them feel strong.

I know plenty of women who are all for the rescue and I know plenty of men who are for the rescue. I just haven't met many women who are for the rescue of men.

I've met plenty of women who are all for the rescue and I know plenty of men who are for the rescue. I just haven't met many women who are for the rescue of men.

I'm not saying that every woman who is attracted to men is a feminist. I'm not saying that every woman who is attracted to men is a feminist. I'm saying that most women are attracted to men, and that most of the women who are attracted to men are in some way sexually submissive to men.

I also think that most women are in some way sexually submissive to men.

The Manosphere and the Real Men's Movement can be understood as two sides of the same coin. I think the Manosphere is a bit more skeptical of feminism, but I think the Real Men's Movement is a lot more skeptical of feminism.

I think the Manosphere is a bit more skeptical of feminism, but I think the Real Men's Movement is a lot more skeptical of feminism.

Is it true that every man is a misogynist?

Yes, it is.

But that's not really the question. The question is: How do you know if you're a misogynist or not? Is there a way to know? If so, what method do you use?

The most obvious way to find out if you're a misogynist is to look at what women are doing. Women are doing everything from wearing revealing clothes to singing about men having sex with dogs to making rape jokes to making fun of sexual assault victims.

Women are doing all of these things, and they're doing them to men. They're doing them to men in a way that is so deeply embedded into our culture that men are completely unaware of it.

If you're one of the men who is aware of these things it's you who is a misogynist, because you are consciously or unconsciously perpetuating the same behavior on women that you see women acting on.

And if you're not aware of this, you are a misogynist.

So how do you know if you're a misogynist? What do you do if you think that a woman is making a joke about rape, but you don't think it's rape? What do you do if you think a woman is dressing up as a man and making a rape joke but you don't think it's rape? What do you do if you think a woman is making a rape joke but you are not sure if she's joking?

If you find yourself making any of these reactions, you probably are a misogynist.

What if you're not aware of these things?

What if you're not aware of these things, and you're making jokes about rape and sexual assault and you don't realize that you're joking about rape and sexual assault? What if you're not aware that you're

In the end, the United States earned a rare win in the World Cup final. The U.S. beat Italy, 2-1, thanks in part to a spectacular goal by Landon Donovan in the 64th minute that came just a little too late to save the Americans from an embarrassing loss.

Donovan scored two goals in the game, including a spectacular header to give the U.S. a 1-0 lead. But things didn't go as planned for the U.S. in the second half, and the Italian came right back.

The U.S. was down a goal. It needed three goals in 60 minutes to win.

Here's a look at the first goal in the game, and the second, which came just a little too late.

But the U.S. couldn't find any answers.

Italy's Mario Balotelli came on for the last 10 minutes of the game, and the U.S. was unable to find any answers.

"We were trying to come up with something," U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann said. "We had a lot of passing combinations, attempts to get in the box, but it was just a matter of time before someone did something.

"I thought [Mario Balotelli] was very good. He had a lot of time on the ball. I thought his movement was very good, he was getting into big spaces. He was very good in the air. His movement was very good. I thought he was a very good addition. We gave him a lot of space to operate."

The United States, though, couldn't convert on those chances and was unable to even make it close.

"It was a horrible game for us," Donovan said. "It was an absolute grind for us. We didn't take our chances. It was just the way it was. I thought it was a pretty good game for us defensively. We didn't create anything in the final third. We played really well in the midfield, but we didn't create anything in the final third. I don't know what it is. We were just lacking that final pass. We didn't get it down, and we were just missing crosses.

"We had a lot of good players, but it just wasn't enough. We had a lot of crosses, and we had a lot of good players. I thought we did a lot of good things, but we didn't put the ball in the right place, and we didn't create enough."

In the end, the U.S. earned a win thanks to Donovan's goal. But it doesn't mean the U.S. was perfect.

The U.S. has been outscored in the World Cup by the Italians, 3-1, including a goal by Balotelli in the final 24 minutes. The Americans also lost the first game of the tournament to Germany, 4-1. And the Americans have been outscored by the Italians, 5-0, in the group stage.

Donovan said the U.S. needs to be better at closing out games.

"I think we have to do a better job of closing games out," Donovan said. "We're getting chances, but we need to finish them. We're not creating enough chances to finish them. I think we need to rectify that."

The United States also needs to find better ways of scoring. The U.S. scored its only goal in the first half, but it didn't find the back of the net.

"We need to score, and we need to put the pressure on them to score," Donovan said. "We don't just want to come out and play the way we did. We want to come out and be a lot more aggressive, and we need to score some more goals."

The U.S. hasn't scored in a game since March 29 when it beat Germany, 2-0. The U.S. has scored a total of four goals in the tournament, and the Italians have scored two.

The U.S. has won the World Cup four times, including the shootout victory in 1990 against the Soviet Union. But the Americans haven't won since defeating Italy in the final in 1986.

"This is a very special day for me, and I am very proud of the team, the players, and the coaching staff," Donovan said. "This is a day I will never forget. I think very few people will remember what happened here in Brazil, but this is a day that I will always cherish."

A TEENAGE girl who was raped at knifepoint has been left devastated and suicidal.

The 18-year-old was attacked in her own home in the town of Gulsby in the South West of England.

She was found by her mother in the early hours of Saturday morning, lying on the floor next to her door.

The girl was rushed to hospital and is still receiving treatment.

Her mother said: "She is not out of danger, but because of the stress of the incident, she is getting worse."

She added: "She will not be going to school on Monday because it is so dangerous.

"She is not sleeping properly, she has never been in danger as such but she is in a lot of pain."

The girl has been in and out of hospital since the attack on June 28.

She was in a critical condition when she was first admitted to the Royal Preston Hospital.

Since then she has had a series of operations and has lost a lot of weight.

The schoolgirl has told her mother she wants to take her own life.

The mother said: "I can't understand how anyone could do this to a child.

"It makes you wonder what other parents and children have been through.

"I do not understand how anyone could do this to a child.

"She is a good girl and was a bright girl but now she is just a shell of her former self."

Police have appealed for witnesses to the attack.

PC David Wall of the South West Police said: "We have received a number of different lines of inquiry from the public in connection with the incident and enquiries continue.

"Our inquiries are at an early stage but we have already made contact with the girl's family.

"We believe this was a targeted attack and we are aware of reports of a series of similar incidents."

Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.<|endoftext|>One morning in June, a dozen V.A. doctors and nurses gathered in the front of the room. Dressed in white surgical scrubs, they were on call, ready to treat someone who might need a kidney transplant. They had called in a dozen patients and requested a kidney for each of them. It was the first time they had ever done this kind of one-stop kidney transplant.

They would do it in a preliminary surgery, which is what they would do in the event that the person they were about to transplant actually needed one.

One of the doctors was Dr. Gillian Hall, a gastroenterologist who had just finished a yearlong fellowship at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. The other doctors were all specialists in kidney transplantation, including a urologist, a hematologist, a hematopoietic oncologist, and two kidney specialists.

The hospital's kidney specialists would do the initial surgery. The doctors who were doing the preliminary surgery were called kidney nephrologists. They would take a kidney from a donor and transplant it into the patient. The two nephrologists would provide a syringe with a special dye so the kidney could be seen under a microscope. A doctor would then inject the dye into the patient's bloodstream, which would make the color of the dye visible on the kidney.

For the preliminary surgery to work, the doctors needed to find a donor who had matched the patient's genetic profile. They could not find a match. So they requested a kidney from a patient who was already on the transplant list. It was a dead donor, a person who had died in the past but whose organs had been donated.

The kidney was taken from a woman who was in her early sixties, lives in the hospital's palliative care unit, and had been in the hospital five years. This was the first time the hospital had agreed to share a deceased donor with another hospital.

When the kidney was given to the new patient, the team took samples from the patient's blood and urine and, using a machine called a flow cytometer, found oncogene — the most commonly circulating form of cancer-causing genetic material — in the patient's blood. This was the first step toward confirming the patient's cancer diagnosis.

If the kidney was successful, the team would then do a genetic test to see what was in the patient's blood. Finally, the team would do a blood bank screening for dangerous blood diseases, including hepatitis B and C, HIV and syphilis.

The transplant team was led by Dr. Howard Renn, a liver specialist and the chief of transplantation at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Renn had been practicing kidney transplantation for more than 30 years, and he believed that he could perform the first kidney transplant in

In a rare political development, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) presidential bid.

"As Democrats, we have always been proud to support the Vermont senator's presidential campaign," DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. "Hillary Clinton ran a strong campaign, but Sen. Sanders' commitment to electing Democrats up and down the ballot in November and his vision for America is something we all share. We look forward to working with him to elect Democrats up and down the ballot."

Politico first reported the news.

Sanders has embraced the DNC's endorsement, thanking the party for its "strong support" during a speech in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.

"This is a Democratic Party that is prepared to stand with working families and the middle class and takes on the greed of the billionaire class," Sanders said. "Democrats will stand together to make sure that Donald Trump Donald John TrumpTrump: Dems playing destructive 'con game' with Kavanaugh Several Yale Law classmates who backed Kavanaugh call for misconduct investigation Freedom Caucus calls on Rosenstein to testify or resign MORE does not become president of the United States."

Sanders has risen in the polls in recent weeks, and has been on the campaign trail with Clinton in Nevada.

Clinton is facing heavy pressure to get out of the race, and a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows the former secretary of State is in danger of losing her lead over Sanders to Vermont's socialist.

The DNC will meet on Saturday to discuss the race, which began as a battle between Clinton and Sen. Sanders (I-Vt.).

But the DNC's endorsement could help Sanders, who is more popular among the party's liberal base than Clinton.

The DNC's move comes as Clinton has struggled to capitalize on her lead over Sanders. She has seen her lead over Sanders erode in recent weeks, and appears to be losing ground to Sanders on the ground in the early voting states.<|endoftext|>Hello my fellow gamers and wannabe gamers! For those of you who don't know me, my name is @Vermintide, and I love to design maps and games. I would like to tell you a little bit about myself and why I am interested in making games.


I was born in 2006 in the island of Guernsey, on the BBCOD, a small island in the North Atlantic. I was raised in a very small town called Burdekin in the island of Jersey. My parents are both from the UK, and I have a younger brother, who was born in the USA.


When I was a young child, my parents were just working in London, and I spent most of my time as a child playing as many games as I could get my hands on, as well as reading comics and playing with my brother. It was only when I discovered Minecraft and the computer science that comes with it that I was able to really get myself into the gaming world.


I have always tried to make things that are fun to play, as well as being fun to play with. I have always been fond of puzzle games, and I enjoy playing games that put you in a situation where you have to use your head. I find that this can be a very satisfying experience.


I have been playing games since I was a child, and I have always been fascinated by the idea of computer games. I was always playing with my brother, and it was fun to see the way the games played out. I was especially fond of the strategy games, and I remember the first time I played Ultima Online, I was so hooked that I continued playing it all through school.


I have always been a fan of the fantasy and science fiction genre, and in my youth I would play a game that was supposed to be set in the future, but I would always go back to the original game, because it always made me feel like I was in an alternate universe.


I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to make games, as I have already had the opportunity to work on quite a few, and I have always been able to create something that is of interest to me. So, where do I want to take my game development career? I am not sure yet, but I do want to make games for people who love games, and I do want to make games that I want to play.


I have a bunch of ideas about games that I have been working on, and I am excited to see how they turn out. It is also important to me that my games are made with as much love as possible, and I want to make games that are fun for people to play, and to make games that are easy to learn.


I would like to thank everyone who has played my games, and I hope you will continue to support me by purchasing and playing my games. I hope I will be able to bring you more

Brees suffered the sprain of his left meniscus in the second quarter of the Saints' 31-14 victory over the Steelers.

Brees told reporters he hoped to play in Sunday's game at New England, but the team expressed disappointment in his injury. Coach Sean Payton said Brees was "very questionable" to play on Sunday.

The Saints have only one other quarterback on the active roster, rookie Garrett Grayson.

On top of Brees' injury, the team's special teams units is in need of help.

The Saints were without punter Thomas Morstead and return man Marcus Murphy for Sunday's game, and the unit struggled in its return game, with the Saints' punt coverage unit giving up a 51-yard touchdown to Antonio Brown on their first punt return. The Saints ran the ball six times for a total of 37 yards.

"As a special teams unit we've got to get better," Payton said. "We're a little bit behind the eight-ball as a special teams unit, and we've got to get better."

The Saints (2-4) are actually already without both of their starting offensive tackles. Center Jonathan Goodwin won't play in Sunday's game due to a knee injury suffered in the second quarter.

The Saints have been shorthanded at left tackle and right tackle with the injuries to Goodwin and Murphy.

Rob Ryan, the Saints' offensive line coach, said the team is not going to make any changes to the line after Sunday's loss.

"We've got the same guys," Ryan said. "We'll just continue to get after it. We'll just keep grinding. We'll keep trying to get better, and hopefully we'll get a little better."

Ryan said he is not concerned about the absence of Goodwin and Murphy, who have been starters for their teams.

"We're not worried about it," he said. "We know that our guys are going to work hard. We know that they'll be ready to go."

Brees is coming off his first 100-yard passing game of the season and the Saints are now 2-0 with him under center.

"It wasn't just the way he played," Payton said. "It was the way he knew how to play, the way he approached the game. He had a lot of really good throws.

"He's one of those guys. He's been doing this for a long time. He understands the game, he knows how to play the game. He's just a perfect fit for our team. He's going to be a great addition to our team."

Brees is one of the NFL's most accomplished and decorated quarterbacks. He won three Super Bowls with the New Orleans Saints and is the franchise's all-time leader in passing yards (55,824), pass attempts (6,646) and completions (69,900). He is also

The only way the Orlando Magic will beat the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night is if they unleash some of their untapped potential.

Orlando has been the NBA's most unathletic team the last two seasons, and now it has a roster full of players with the potential to get even better.

"You could count on one hand the number of guys on this roster that are unselfish," coach Frank Vogel said. "I like our chances. We have a lot of guys that can make shots. We have a lot of guys who can get to the free throw line, and I expect a lot of guys to get to the line. "

The Magic have more talent than the Suns, but they have been inconsistent over the last two seasons, and they know that. The only way they will beat Phoenix is with the four-out, one-in offense that Vogel has preached.

"I'm not sure what the Suns are going to do," guard Victor Oladipo said. "I think they're going to try to play simple and try to attack us. It's not like we're going to be able to play pick-and-roll all the time. We have to be able to switch on the pick-and-roll. We need to be able to get out and move the ball."

The Suns have some good players on their roster, but they need to figure out a way to make them better.

"I think we all know how good these guys are," guard Eric Bledsoe said. "We have to play with more energy on that end. We've got to play with more energy on that end. We don't want to lose these games, but we want to win them."

The Magic have a strong bench, but they will need to rely on its defense to beat the Suns.

"I just think we have to be more relentless," Orlando center Nikola Vucevic said.

They hope to get a boost from their bench, especially during the second half.

The Magic's bench is making a lot of noise in the NBA, and they'll need to play better than they did against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday.

"We're starting to figure it out," Bledsoe said. "We're starting to figure out our identity. We're starting to figure out the chemistry and the chemistry is at an all-time high right now. We're just trying to get the guys playing together and have fun together."

The Magic have the talent to beat any team in the NBA, and they hope to be able to do that once again.

"Right now we have the best roster in the NBA," Bledsoe said. "We have the best coach in the NBA. We're starting to figure it out. We just have to keep working hard."

If the Magic win Thursday night, it will be their 13th win of the season.

"This is the NBA. This is how it goes. You have to be at your best every night," Bledsoe said.

Orlando's only loss of the season came on Nov. 4 against the Utah Jazz, and the Magic are coming off another strong defensive performance, holding the Jazz to 40.7 percent shooting.

Utah has had a lot of success against the Magic this season.

The Jazz are 34-11 against the Magic when the teams have played a game this season.

The Jazz are 9-2 against the Magic when the teams meet on the road.

The Magic have won their last three games against Utah.

The new high-tech, high-rise apartment complex on the University of California, Berkeley campus that opened last fall is a public-private partnership and has a unique feature: an underwater promenade.

What, exactly, is this underwater promenade? It seems to be a kind of "vista," though one that, to my best understanding, is entirely unnatural.

In any case, there are a lot of questions about the Vista.

First, in the classic way of Berkeleyside, I sought out a representative from the UC Berkeley student body. I asked if I could meet with the students. After some discussion, I was told that the student government had no interest in a debate on the Vista.

To my surprise, the student representative I spoke to did have a few questions about some of the questions that are being raised. I will address them in this article, but I wanted to give them a chance to clarify some of the information I am still getting from students.

I asked what the students thought the Vista's underwater promenade was. The student rep said it was a "feature" of the building. The Vista, after all, is supposed to be "water friendly."

The Vista is "a private, public-private partnership," according to one of the city of Berkeley's "informal" reports. I was told that the team of architects, architects' firms, construction companies, contractors and other creative people who worked on the Vista had consulted with the city. But that the city had not yet approved the design for it.

The Vista is a "unique" building, according to the Berkeley Citizen, which has a long, thoughtful story about the Vista. The Citizen writes:

The university has been working with housing experts and professors to develop a new housing concept that it hopes will encourage a new wave of student housing, attracting students to UC Berkeley in order to get a degree.

The Vista is "a public-private partnership," according to Berkeley's official website. The website adds:

The building is a part of a strategy to increase housing supply, which will help to maintain the steady increase in the number of students coming to UC Berkeley.

I asked UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof if the Vista was a public-private partnership. He said so.

My next question was, "How does the Vista work?"

As I put it to Mogulof, UC Berkeley's official website does not answer the question, "How does the Vista work?"

I emailed Mogulof to ask if the Vista works like a walkway or a tubular structure. He wrote back:

The Vista is a walkway.

The Vista is a tubular structure.

The Vista is a walkway, but not a tubular structure.

I asked Mogulof if the Vista was like a "water park," to which he responded:

That is a different scenario.

The Vista is a walkway.

The Vista is a tubular structure.

The Vista is not a water park.

I asked how the Vista works – on a technical level, the basics of how it works – and Mogulof did not respond.

In any case, I am not aware of any formal description of the Vista in the official UC Berkeley website.

I did write to UC Berkeley's Student Center to ask if it has any information about the Vista, to see if it was really a promenade. The Student Center said it does.

The Vista, the Student Center wrote, is "a water-based promenade that provides an outdoor space for residents to enjoy with their neighbors, friends and

Initial reaction was that the study was a triumph for science: Study finds that the human body has evolved to cope with our changing climates. But, as was the case with every study claiming to have found a new way to be miserable, there was a flipside: the study also proved that our bodies have evolved to cope with our changing climates.

The study, published in the journal Science, found that people living in areas of the world that are warmer and wetter than they are today were more likely to develop cancer. The study also found that the risk of heart disease and other conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure were higher in those living in cold, dry climates.

These results are not surprising, considering the link between climate change and cancer. A surge in the number of cancer cases in some parts of Europe was linked to the onset of the coldest winter in a century in 2014, while the same researchers found that the number of deaths from cancer in Europe in 2014 was almost double than the number of deaths from the coldest winter in the last century.

So why are the reasons for climate change still not clear? A paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association this week offers a few possible explanations.

Climate change and obesity

The study, led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Oxford, looked at data on climate and obesity published in more than 1,000 studies. It found that the effect of climate change on obesity was small, including a 13 per cent reduction in obesity rates among those living in countries that are warming fast.

However, there was evidence that the effect was stronger in countries such as the UK, where the effect was more substantial. It concluded that the association between climate change and obesity may partly be down to the fact that most of the research examined the effects of climate change on a single variable – obesity.

The effect of climate change on obesity was also stronger among those from countries that are warming fast, such as the UK.

The authors of the study said that this was surprising because obesity rates have been rising in many countries, including the UK, for years.

"We were surprised that the effect of climate change on obesity was stronger in countries that are warming fast, such as the UK. A higher incidence of obesity can lead to a higher prevalence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer," said study author Professor Chris Ryan.

"We suspect that this is driven by the global prevalence of obesity and the fact that the recent declines in obesity rates have been in countries that are warming rapidly, such as the UK."

The link between obesity and climate change is not new, but the study offers new evidence that may help explain why the link may be stronger in the UK.

"We found that obesity was significantly associated with climate change in the UK, and that the effect of climate change on obesity was stronger for men than for women. Previous studies have shown that obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and certain cancers, so we wanted to see if climate change was also associated with these increased risks," said Professor Ryan.

"But whether the increase in obesity risk due to climate change is directly linked to increased cardiovascular disease and cancer risk has not been studied. Our study shows that climate change can impact health by affecting obesity risk, but we need to do more research to understand the effects of climate change on these two major causes of death."

The effects of climate change on death rates from infectious diseases

The same team of researchers, led by Dr Martin Ottosen and Dr Michael Brauer, looked at the relationship between temperature and death rates from infectious diseases. They found that, over the past 50 years, the number of deaths from respiratory infections, such as colds and the flu, have increased in both the UK and the US, but deaths from infectious diseases have decreased.

They concluded that this was due to changes in the way infectious diseases are treated.

"This suggests that temperature may change the way in which people are treated for infectious diseases, and that this might be one of the factors that influences the number of deaths from infectious diseases," said Dr Ottosen.

The researchers cited a report published in the journal Nature last year that said rising temperatures were contributing to a rise in the number of children suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a severe lung infection, which had been linked to the spread of the virus SARS.

"In some ways, this is more surprising than the effect of climate change on obesity. It's fairly straightforward to quantify the effect of climate change on obesity. The effect of climate change on infectious diseases is a bit harder to quantify."

Mental health

The researchers also looked at mental health, including changes in suicide rates and rates of depression. They found a trend towards an increase in suicide rates in the US, and also in Europe, and a decrease in depression rates in

Robot Tentacles (2012)

I have a new project that I'm trying to implement. This game is based on a video game I saw a few years ago. The game has two types of robots. One is a regular, ordinary one that is just like any other robot. The other type of robot has their arms attached to their sides. It has two arms with a third one that comes out of the back of the robot. It can throw the other robot at the player! I'm trying to create a bigger battle, with more enemies, more levels, and more explosions. I've already been working on it for over a year, but I'm still working on it. I'm hoping to have it out sometime in 2014.

======================================== SAMPLE 163 ========================================
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Alabama coach Nick Saban called his decision to fire offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin "re-evaluating the program" and said the search for a new coordinator "will be competitive."

Saban said he has not spoken to Alabama's athletic director, Bill Battle, about the situation and he did not discuss the decision with Kiffin, who was fired Monday. He did not say whether the decision was made before or after his team's 56-53 loss to Mississippi State on Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium.

"You can't take a job at Alabama and not be competitive," Saban said. "That's just not what we do here. Until I get a better feel of the situation, I'm not going to talk about it."

Saban said Kiffin's replacement should be determined by the end of the week.

"I've got a lot of respect for Coach Battle," Saban said. "He's a good man. He's a good coach. But we will be competitive. We just won the game. I'm going to do what's in the best interest of the football team."

The Crimson Tide (11-2, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) has lost five straight games -- with the lone win coming against No. 16 Florida -- and the second-year coach said he was disappointed to lose a game that was "an opportunity for us to get better."

"This is a great program and we're all big fans of the University of Alabama, but I'm disappointed that we couldn't get a win that we wanted to win," Saban said. "We weren't aggressive enough in the first quarter, and we couldn't make enough plays in the second quarter. We didn't have enough energy at the end of the game."

Saban said he has spoken to Alabama's athletic director, Bill Battle, about the offensive coordinator position. AP Photo/Brynn Anderson

Saban said he spoke with Battle before the game and had a brief conversation after it, but he did not discuss the decision with his team.

"I think that's going to be a tough spot for him," Saban said. "I've talked to him a few times about it, but I haven't talked to the team yet. I'm sure he was disappointed. I don't think he wanted to lose that game, obviously. I don't think he wanted to lose that game more than anybody else. If we're going to be successful, we're going to have to be more aggressive. We didn't do that."

Kiffin's decision to resign comes after a disappointing season in which the Tide had won 11 games and played in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game, but has lost nine of 11 since.

Saban said he is not worried about the team's confidence level entering the offseason.

"I don't think the guys are down," Saban said. "They're not down right now. They've got a lot to play for. We've got a lot to play for. We've got a lot to play for here in the SEC. I don't think they're down right now. They've got a lot of work to do. They're going to have a lot of work to do this summer. I don't think they're down right now in the sense that they're not excited about what they're doing at the moment. That's not the case right now. They're excited about what they're doing now. They're just not very excited about what they're doing in the future."

Saban said he is not worried about the team's confidence level entering the offseason.

"I don't think the guys are down right now. They're not down right now. They've got a lot to play for. We've got a lot to play for here in the SEC. I don't think they're down right now. They've got a lot to play for now. We've got a lot to play for here in the SEC. I don't think they're down right now in the sense that they're not excited about what they're doing at the moment. That's not the case right now. They're excited about what they're doing now. They're just not very excited about what they're doing in the future."

Because Saban said he is not concerned about the team's confidence level entering the offseason, he did not say whether he would seek to extend Kiffin's contract beyond this season.

Saban has said he would consider extending Kiffin's contract if the team's win total increased to 10 or 11 wins.

"I haven't talked to him about that," Saban said. "He's done a great job and I'm very proud of him. I think he's been a very good coach for us. We'll sit down and we'll talk about that. I'll talk to him about that as well."

"The whole idea of the man and the woman is a myth," he said. "My ideology is that there is no such thing as gender."

Mr. Apfelbaum, who founded the Berlin-based Institute for New European Studies in 2010, is a prolific writer and editor and has written works on Islamism, the Palestinian conflict and the Middle East. His work on the Holocaust has won him invitations to speak around the world.

Mr. Apfelbaum, who was born in Poland in 1927, and his family escaped in 1939, and he has been a member of the Nazi party since 1961, is also known for his writings on the subject of Jewish history and nationalism and for his role in the publication of a book last year on the Nazi Party's "Waffen SS," the elite fighting force of the Nazi party.

In a statement issued on Monday, the institute said it "takes great pains to not associate itself with Mr. Apfelbaum's racist and anti-Semitic views." Mr. Apfelbaum did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.

The institute said that Mr. Apfelbaum's views on gender and sexuality were not based on his own personal views. "Instead, they have been developed through his work as an editor of the institute's journal," it said.<|endoftext|>Mexico and the United States have agreed to work together to track down and send back Central American migrants who have crossed into the United States illegally, a senior Mexican official said on Monday.

The Mexican government has come under growing pressure in recent months to reduce the number of migrants crossing illegally into the United States.

The number of migrants crossing the Mexico-U.S. border has more than tripled this year, to about 52,000, and authorities have been unable to reduce the flow by sealing the southern U.S. border.

On Monday, Mexico's foreign minister, Jose Antonio Meade, said he and his American counterpart, Luis Videgaray, had agreed to share information on any migrants who arrive in Mexico or in the United States, and "to cooperate together to track these people down and send them back to their country of origin."

The pair also agreed to "identify the causes of migration," Meade added.

Meade said the two nations were working to improve their cooperation on migration issues, with an eye to "avoiding any future incidents like the one that occurred in the Rio Grande Valley near El Paso, Texas, in late July."

Some 11,000 migrants crossing into the United States from Mexico have died so far this year.

In July, migrants and U.S. Border Patrol agents clashed in the Rio Grande Valley as agents tried to stop migrants from crossing into the United States.

The incident sparked anti-immigrant sentiment and accusations of racist behavior, and prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to take a hard line on illegal immigration.<|endoftext|>You don't have any notifications.

The Justice Department has acknowledged that it "could" open an official investigation into the Trump campaign's possible collusion with Russia.

Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein said Sunday on ABC's "This Week" that he would "look at it," but he did not indicate whether the department would look into any specific accusations or whether any probe would be formalized.

"There have been a lot of allegations out there," he said. "I'm not going to get ahead of any investigation, but I think it's important to recognize that investigations are ongoing."

Rosenstein said on ABC that "we don't know what the facts are" in the Russia investigation.

He said he was "not going to comment" on any of the investigations into the Trump campaign, but indicated that, "as the president said, the Russians interfered in our elections.

"I think it is important for the American people to understand that that's happening and that the investigation will determine whether or not that's a purposeful action by the Russian government," Rosenstein said.

Rosenstein said he does not believe Rosenstein is the one who made the decision to appoint special counsel Robert Mueller to oversee the Russia investigation.

"I don't think it was ever his decision," he said. "I certainly don't think it was his decision to appoint Bob Mueller, but Bob Mueller is here now and we'll do the best we can as a department to make sure he's doing a good job."

Rosenstein said he was confident that Mueller would "do the right thing" when he begins his investigation.

"I have confidence that Bob Mueller will do the right thing," Rosenstein said. "He's an honorable man, a man of integrity."

"I don't want to micromanage; that's not my role," he added. "But I think in all of these cases, you have the right people at the right place at the right time. I'm confident that Bob Mueller will do the right thing."

Rosenstein said he will recuse himself from any decisions involving the Mueller probe, but he will remain involved in any discussions about how to handle the special counsel.

"I will recuse myself in any decisions that might affect the investigation," he said.

"I have a long-standing friendship and professional relationship with Bob Mueller," he said, "and I have confidence that he will do the right thing."<|endoftext|>The first time that I heard the term "basket case" I was in the hospital. I was a young, 17-year-old sweet girl with a lot of energy. I always made my parents laugh, and I was very popular. I also had a lot of energy. For some reason, all of this energy made me very insecure and I was afraid to lose it. I was afraid of being rejected, of not being able to get a date, of being a failure, of not being good enough. I was afraid of being weak and vulnerable.

I was afraid of losing my energy, losing my health, losing my love.

I was so afraid that I didn't even realize that I was doing all of these things that I was afraid of. Life was hard for me, and I'd been in the hospital for just about a month.

I believe that people who have more energy are more resilient. We tend to have a greater ability to make up for our weaknesses. We have more energy to find solutions, to move forward, to take action. We have the ability to make productive use of our time. We don't have to run to the store to buy groceries. We don't have to get up at 3 am. We can eat right, exercise, and work on our hobbies. We can be more creative, pursue our passions, and feel good about ourselves.

But people who are more vulnerable are not immune to being plagued by fear. I believe that people who are more vulnerable are more susceptible to being plagued by fear. I believe that people who are more vulnerable are not immune to being plagued by fear.

I was overwhelmed by fear. I was afraid of failure. I was afraid of failures.

It became very clear to me that I was afraid of not being good enough. I was afraid of not being good enough and getting rejected. I was afraid of not being good enough and being unhealthy. I was afraid of not being good enough and not being able to get a date. I was afraid of not being good enough and not having friends. I was afraid of not being good enough and not being able to get a job. I was afraid of not being good enough and not being able to work hard.

It was very clear to me that I was afraid of being overwhelmed. I was afraid of being overwhelmed and not being able to make it through the day. I was afraid of being overwhelmed and not being able to get through the day.

The NYPD has recently been under scrutiny for its use of police-worn body cameras, which have been criticized for increasing transparency and accountability. In addition, the NYPD has used surveillance equipment, such as license plate readers, to track people.

Civil-rights advocates have also been critical of the department's policy of using its controversial stop-and-frisk tactic, in which police stop individuals and search them (at very low levels) for weapons. The tactic has been widely criticized by civil-rights advocates and individuals who have been subject to the tactic.

The ACLU and other groups have called on the Department of Justice to investigate the NYPD's use of military-grade equipment, and the ACLU is now asking the Department of Justice to investigate if the NYPD is violating the Americans with Disabilities Act.

"The NYPD should strictly adhere to the New York City Human Rights Law, which requires the NYPD to treat people with disabilities fairly and equally," said Rita Sklar, deputy legal director at the ACLU of Northern California. "We're calling on the Department of Justice to investigate whether the NYPD is violating the ADA by using military-grade equipment to make arrests, even when these individuals lack disabilities."

The ACLU is also asking the Department of Justice to investigate if the NYPD is violating the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The ACLU's letter also requests that the DOJ investigate "whether the NYPD is using military-grade equipment to make arrests, even when these individuals lack disabilities."

The letter is addressed to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and was signed by the ACLU's New York branch, the ACLU of Southern California, the ACLU of Southern New Jersey, the ACLU of New Mexico, the ACLU of Pennsylvania, the ACLU of Southern Utah, the ACLU of the District of Columbia, the ACLU of Washington, the ACLU of Connecticut, the ACLU of Maine, the ACLU of the Northern Mariana Islands, the ACLU of Vermont, the ACLU of New Hampshire, the ACLU of New York, and the ACLU of Puerto Rico.

The letter is available here.

Updated

Two children have died and 20 others are injured in Connecticut after a gunman opened fire at their elementary school.

The gunman was killed after a brief exchange with police and the rampage ended at about 8:40am on Wednesday at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.

The gunman was identified as 20-year-old Adam Lanza, who grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey, and attended Sandy Hook.

Police said Lanza was a student at the school for about two years.

Police chief Michael Kehoe said investigators had determined that Mr Lanza had acted alone.

"We have no information to indicate that there is any kind of nexus between this school and that individual, and that person's actions," Mr Kehoe said in a news conference.

Mr Kehoe said the gunman went to the school "

The car was sold with a clean title, which is the most common type of title in Germany.

The website, called Credo, is backed by the US thinktank Heartland Institute, which has been at the centre of a row over its claims that the science of climate change is unsettled, and its climate science denial claims.

The site's first posting, which is titled "The truth about climate change", claims that the scientific consensus on climate change is "a lie" and that the earth has only been warming "1/3 of one degree since 1880".

Professor Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Arizona, says the site has a limited audience, but that it is aimed at "dissenting opinion" on climate change.

The site was launched on Thursday by Overpeck, who also leads the Arizona-based Heartland Institute. He told The Guardian that the website would be based on two main themes: debunking climate science, and highlighting the fact

The State Department has a new official Twitter account.

The account, @StateDept, was created Thursday, and it will maintain a mostly low-key profile.

The account is currently unverified, meaning that it's not yet been reviewed by the Twitter website as a verified account.

Still, the account's description is quite striking:

"The @StateDept Twitter account is an official account of the United States Department of State. We aim to provide timely, informative, and accurate information from the Department to the public. Our goal is to engage, educate, and inspire."

The account is a departure from the more contentious, politically charged, and often controversial accounts run by the department.

Twitter users are encouraged to follow the account at its new location.

The new Twitter account has 42,000 followers, and it has posted few tweets since its creation. It's not clear what the purpose of the new account is.

The tweet below is from the account's first tweet, which has since been deleted:

A State Department spokesman lauded the new account:

Verified accounts are important for the department, spokesman John Kirby said. Twitter has banned accounts run by other government agencies, and Kirby said that it is difficult for the department to have an official account because it's so heavily scrutinized.

(CNN) - It's back to business as usual for White House press secretary Jay Carney on Thursday, while the rest of the country is still dealing with the aftermath of Tuesday's deadly attacks in Boston.

Carney's latest media avail­al came during a two-hour White House press conference, in which the press secretary was asked about the "fog of war" and the ongoing investigation into the Boston Marathon bombings.

"The danger to our country is not just that we have a terrorist attack, but that we have a terrorist attack that occurs on American soil," Carney said. "The American people have every reason to be very concerned about this."

"The President has spoken repeatedly and forcefully about the need to get to the bottom of this," Carney said. "We will continue to pursue every angle of this investigation to render it with maximum effectiveness."

Carney was asked about the ongoing investigation and whether the U.S. government was playing games with the case.

"The President and his top advisers are very concerned about the threat of terrorism, not only in the United States but around the world. And I think that the best way to do that is to continue to go through a thorough and aggressive investigation that is transparent and that the American people can trust," Carney said.

"We will not stop until we have the answers that we need and we can be confident that we have apprehended the person who was responsible for this attack."

The president's press secretary said the investigation is "extremely important" to the country and that the FBI has "a lot of work ahead of them."

Carney also was asked about the incident of the Boston Marathon, which was closed for a number of hours after the second bombing, which killed three people and injured at least 134.

"This is a very sad day in Boston," Carney said. "The victims and the families are in our thoughts and prayers."

But he also said the incident of Tuesday's attacks was "an attack on America."

"This is an attack on our way of life and on our freedom and on our way of life around the world," he said. "The entire world is watching this. We will not stop until we have the answers that we need."<|endoftext|>The San Jose Earthquakes on Wednesday signed veteran defender Kip Colvey to a new contract.

I have been married for more than a decade and I have to admit that my husband and I are compatible. We have the same interests, the same values, and we have similar personalities. We're both very active, creative, funny, and hard-working. We both love art, books, music, and travel. Everyone says we're compatible.

But I wonder sometimes if the things we share are actually a big part of our incompatibility. In fact, it's become a problem for us. Both of us are learning that we can't always get along with our husband.

I'm not talking about the problems between us. I'm talking about the things that we can't agree on and don't agree on.

My husband is learning that we can't always get along with each other. (We were married for more than 10 years).

One issue is our tendency to compare ourselves to others. I'm a stay-at-home mom and he's a stay-at-home dad with three kids. We're both teachers and he's the head of the school board. It's hard to get along when he's making the decisions that affect my life.

Another issue is our tendency to compete. It's a competitive world out there and if we try to outshine each other, we can be destructive. I'm competitive, so I'm giving my husband a hard time about the way he dresses (he wears jeans, t-shirts, and sweatshirts), his hair (he cuts it short), and his hobbies (he loves to draw, paint, and decorate with his kids).

So what do we do? We can't always get along.

I want to find a way to help him with his issues. I want to help him see that, even though there are problems, we are still partners in our life. But how?

This week we are packing up our kids and moving to the other side of the country, to a place where we can be closer together.

We are both writing about our experiences on our blog. (I'm called "The Mommy Blogger" and my husband "The Dad Blogger.") We'd like to share our experiences and see if we can help each other see what's happening.

I know that we may not have everything in common, but I also know that we can help each other. I'm just not sure how.

Any thoughts?

Love,

The Mommy Blogger

Dear Mommy Blogger:

We are both so lucky to have found our husband. He has a great job and he is a great father.

I know that you are very happy for him and surprised by the many compliments you receive. These compliments are nice, but they are not equal to the things you feel.

I'm sorry you are disappointed. But the problems don't end with the marriage. They continue in your life and in your children's lives.

It's like the difference between having a good relationship with a nice man and a good relationship with a bad man. I have a wonderful relationship with my husband, but there are times when I don't.

I don't mind the compliments that you receive from his children, but I have to wonder what it is like for you. How do you feel about them, when you are not in the same room?

If you have children, you know exactly how I feel. I have a difficult time being at home with my children because I'm always trying to be the best I can be. When I'm not, I can't control my children.

I know you have very good intentions, but you're probably aware that your husband is a busy man. When you are trying to take care of your family, you are not able to balance it with your career.

I know that you have to work, but you're always trying to make sure that your husband gets some of the credit. I'm sure you don't want your husband to think that he is a better father than you are.

But this is where you have to realize that your husband is a wonderful person. You are not the problem. These problems are your problem. He cannot change the way he is. He is doing what he has to do to do what he believes is best for his family.

I know that you have great intentions, but you have to realize that you are not the one with the problem. The problem is that it's not what you want for your family. You want a happy, healthy, healthy family, but you don't want to sacrifice your career. That's not fair for your children.

I know that your husband is a hard worker, but he still has to take care of the kids. He can't expect them to work 12 hours a day at the daycare center and then take care of the kids while

Image copyright Getty Images

Joey Gittleson is 60 years old, and is currently a lance corporal in the US Army.

He has spent the last 20 years studying every book written on the US army, and has written a book on every single one of them.

In his forthcoming book, he has compiled a list of the most important books ever written on the US military, from the days of the American Revolution to the modern day.

"I've read books on military history for 20 years, so this is my 20th book," he says.

"There's this one book called The Sum of All Fears, which says the US was founded as a country to protect the rights of all people, and it's a little sad because it's a great book. It's about slavery, but it's a book about the whole of human history."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Sum of All Fears was written in 1859 by David McCullough

Joey has also read a book called The Civil War, which he says was about the "greatest moral conflict in American history".

"It was really about the injustice of slavery - who was going to have the right to own people," he says.

"It was a very interesting book because it was written by a white man, but it was very accurate."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Civil War was about the "greatest moral conflict in American history"

Joey says his favourite book is a collection of short stories by the famous African-American writer, Langston Hughes.

"He was a white man, but he wrote books about black people and black people's life, and he wrote really funny books. People such as Bob Dylan, and James Baldwin, would join Langston Hughes' family and read his stories. They were funny, but also very deep."

Vintage Books, £19.99

Joe Gittleson's first book, The United States Army in America, is a history of the US army written from the perspective of a white American male in the late 19th and early 20th century.

It examines the formation of the army in the early days of the United States, the war against Mexico, and the Mexican War.

Joe Gittleson's second book, The Civil War, is a collection of short stories by the famous African-American writer Langston Hughes.

It is a history of the "greatest moral conflict in American history."

The third book Joey has written is about the Vietnam War, and deals with the killing of civilians in the war by the US military.

"The Vietnam war was a war that was fought for a very long time. One of the things that I wanted to do with the book was to show how people got killed, and it was often by the US military."

Last week, the Arizona Cardinals placed tackle Jared Veldheer on injured reserve. The move was made after he suffered a torn pectoral muscle in Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Now, the Cardinals are reportedly set to release Veldheer, NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday.

The Cardinals put Veldheer on IR at the request of head coach Bruce Arians, Rapoport added. The team will take a $2.5 million hit on the roster in order to release Veldheer.

A healthy Veldheer could have provided some stability for the Cardinals' offensive line. Arizona has been beset by injuries, though, and Veldheer was the team's only healthy tackle this season.

The Cardinals are now just four tackles away from the NFL record for most players under contract, according to Rapoport.

I was surprised by the way Ericsson was interviewed. He actually said that he was referred to as a "nerd" and then quickly corrected himself, saying that he was referring to his research. In other words, he takes it as a given that he is a nerd and never really cares what people call him.

He also said that he was not "all that interested in biology" and that he was actually a musician.

I don't know what it is about music that makes people call themselves "nerds," but I thought that was amusing.

The second interview was with Dr. John Tooby of the University of California, Santa Barbara. He was also interviewed by Chwastyk.

I thought Tooby's interview was a bit more interesting, because he was actually fun and engaging. The only thing I found interesting was his opinion that nerds are not obsessed with "science."

I was also impressed with how much he was willing to talk about his books. He was very forthcoming about his theories and he even said that he was taking the next book on his list, "The Adapted Mind: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology."

Tooby is also known for being a contentious thinker. He is known for his work on "moral development."

For those of you that are unfamiliar with "moral development," Tooby and his colleagues, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides, developed a theory that all human beings have a common set of core moral principles. These moral principles guide how people think about their actions, and help them to follow through on those actions.

Tooby and Cosmides' theory has been met with considerable skepticism. For instance, in a 2006 paper, two psychologists, Joseph Henrich and Kevin Murphy, wrote, "Much of the literature focuses on the role of moral cognition in influencing behavior, but there is little evidence for a universal morality."

In their paper, "Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing? Do Moral Principles Exist?" in the journal Science, the authors describe Tooby and Cosmides' theory as "nothing more than a caricature of the evolutionary psychology enterprise."

That's pretty harsh. I guess there's some truth to that.

Regardless, it's interesting to see scientists like Tooby and Cosmides and Ericsson defend their theories.

In the end, what I took away from the interviews was that nerds are still nerds. They are just more socially adept than other people.

Nerdiness doesn't have to be a bad thing.<|endoftext|>The Prime Minister has officially placed a ban on the sale of meat from animals including pigs, cows, sheep and chickens.

Photo: 123rf

It follows a decision by Mr Key to ban the sale of eggs from caged hens last year.

New Zealand's National Party is opposed to the move, saying it would hurt a "vibrant local and national food industry".

Animal welfare groups say the ban will do little to affect animal welfare and the industry will continue to raise pigs and cows on pasture, in open weather and with no confinement.

A ban on pork would have little effect on the National Party's argument that meat from animals raised on pasture is of lesser welfare than those raised

In a brief statement, the Justice Department said it would not seek to impose any additional sanctions on Russia, arguing that the issue of the election hacking is a working one.

"The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that justice is done, and will pursue appropriate criminal and civil charges to the maximum extent permitted by law," the statement said. "The Department of Justice is also committed to coordinating, with the FBI and other relevant agencies, with a view to ensuring the fullest possible exchange of information."

The statement came after Mr. Trump on Friday dismissed the Russia inquiry as a "hoax" and a "witch hunt," and after the president's national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, was forced to resign for failing to tell the truth about his contacts with Mr. Kislyak.

After a meeting with Mr. Putin on Friday, Mr. Trump said he did not feel under any pressure to turn over Mr. Flynn's communications with the Russian ambassador and said that he would talk to the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, about the matter.

In Moscow, Mr. Putin had said that Mr. Trump had not talked about the issue, in part because he did not think Mr. Flynn had done anything wrong.

The Foreign Ministry said that Mr. Putin welcomed Mr. Trump's decision to lift economic sanctions and acknowledged that "practically all" other presidents had done the same. The ministry added that Mr. Putin did not expect any additional measures from the United States.

The Obama administration imposed sanctions on Russia in December after the Russian government's annexation of Crimea and interference in Ukraine. The sanctions were designed to punish Russia for the election hacking.

"It's necessary to make clear to everybody that the United States is not going to tolerate any attempts to harm our bilateral relations," Mr. Trump said in a statement.

"However, in response to the actions by the Russian government, the Obama administration struck back by imposing further sanctions on Russia. It's time to move on to bigger and better things," he added.

The Kremlin, in a statement, said Mr. Putin had been pleased with the president's decision. "He said that the US sanctions were an obstacle to the development of bilateral relations. He said that the US side must immediately stop the provocative actions and stop trying to harm the bilateral relations," the statement said.

The sanctions were imposed over what the administration said was Russia's interference in the election. The administration did not accuse the Russian government of directly hacking the computers of the Democratic National Committee or John D. Podesta, the chairman of Mrs. Clinton's campaign for president.

The administration also took the unusual step of accusing Russia of trying to interfere in the presidential election by spreading disinformation and using social media to exacerbate divisions within the country.

The administration accused Moscow of using cyberattacks to help Mr. Trump win the election.

"It's clear that the Russian government is attempting to interfere in our election," Mr. Obama said in the statement. "We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities."

He added, "There is no clear evidence that anyone other than the Russian government was involved in the direct hacking of our political organizations."

Mr. Trump has said that the Russian hacks were carried out by "somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds."

The administration of Mr. Obama in December announced that it had expelled 35 Russian intelligence operatives in response to the election hacking.

In a statement, the Russian Embassy in Washington said it welcomed the decision to lift the sanctions. "It's in the interests of both countries and the international community that these steps be taken swiftly," the statement said.

Mr. Trump's national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, resigned on Feb. 13 after it was revealed that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Mr. Kislyak.

In the wake of those revelations, Mr. Trump suggested that he might pardon Mr. Flynn, a retired four-star Army general who had been a critical figure in his transition team.

The president's remarks on Friday appear to have prompted a change in the tide of the investigation by Mr. Comey. Mr. Trump was asked about the Russia investigation during a news conference on Friday.

"With respect to the investigation into Russia, I have no idea," Mr. Trump said. "I haven't been told. As far as I'm concerned I'm looking into it."

The president later added, "I have nothing to do with Russia

As a child, my dad was a big sports fan. He liked to watch the games—the Yankees, the Spurs and more. He was a football fan. When he was a young man, he was the defensive coordinator for the team. When he was in his mid-twenties, he was named the head coach of the New York Jets.

My dad was a game-day parent. He would spend hours at the stadium watching games.

After I was born, my dad was still the head coach of the Jets. He was still a football fan, and he was still a football fan in his mid-30s. I know this because he told me so.

So after he retired from his job, he took off for Chicago, where he continued coaching football and was an assistant coach at the University of Illinois. Once he got back to New York, he took a job as the general manager of the Jets.

As an adult, I was a coach. I was the head football coach of the Jets. No one ever said anything to me about my dad.

But this year, I learned that he was still a massive football fan and a huge Jets fan. So I asked him about it.

"Oh," he said. "I just think you should be the one to ask about that."

Here's what he said:

"You know, I used to be a big football fan. I loved the teams. I loved the players. I loved the game. I used to watch the games before the game. I used to watch the games after the game. I used to go to the games. I used to travel to the games, and then I used to have a lot of fun. But then something happened. I got to the point where I couldn't watch the games. I got to the point where I couldn't do it anymore. I just couldn't do it anymore.

"I realized that I couldn't live with myself if I couldn't watch my favorite team. I used to love the Jets. I used to love the players. I used to love the game. I used to love meeting the players. I used to love these fans. I used to love the game. But I just couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't watch it anymore. I couldn't watch anymore. I couldn't do it anymore. So I was like, 'OK. I'm just going to stop watching the Jets.'"

He paused.

He reflected on that for a moment.

"I'm sorry, son."

He paused.

"I'm sorry."

Then he said it again.

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's all I can say."

He paused.

"I'm sorry."

I was stunned. I couldn't believe I had never talked to him about it.

He retired from coaching the Jets in 2006. A few years later, he was hired as the general manager of the Broncos. He's been with the Broncos since 2010.

It has been nearly six years.

So I asked him.

"Did you watch the Jets [from the time he was a young man in his twenties]?"

"Yes," he said. "I loved watching the Jets. I remember I used to always be around this little table, watching the games. Watching the games, all the players. I remember when I was in college, I was at the University of Illinois, and I used to go to the games. I used to have a lot of fun. I remember going to the games in Chicago. I remember sitting in a seat in the northeast corner, and I used to sit there and watch the games. I used to sit there and watch the games. I used to sit there and watch the games. I used to watch the games in Chicago. I used to watch the games in Chicago. I used to watch the games in Chicago.

"I used to be a big football fan. I loved the teams. I loved the players. I loved the game. I used to watch the games before the game. I used to watch the games after the game. I used to go to the games. I used to travel to the games, and then I used to have a lot of fun. But then something happened. I got to the point where I couldn't watch the games. I got to the point where I couldn't do it anymore. I just couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't watch it anymore. So I was like, 'OK. I'm just going to stop watching the Jets.'"

The first time I saw him play was the Jets beat the Dolphins in 2007. He was a rookie.

"I knew him," I told him. "I knew him from Chicago. I knew him when I was young."

Week 1 of the Major League Soccer season kicked off on Friday night with a Chicago Fire and New England Revolution match at Stade Saputo.

The Fire had their fair share of scoring opportunities during the first half, but couldn't find the back of the net. A Jay Heaps' decision to go with a back 4 for the first half was perfectly timed as the Fire were able to earn a well-deserved victory.

The Revs' offense was very effective this game as they found the back of the net in each half. A couple of key details that stood out to me were:

-The Revolution's defensive midfielder, Diego Fagundez, was absent from the match. However, the Revolution were able to make several key defensive plays that kept the Fire from getting into a dangerous situation.

-The Revs were able to get forward very effectively at times, but a couple of their key passes that were headed backwards were uncharacteristic of the Revs.

Here's the video of the first half:

Here's the video of the second half:

In the end, Chicago took all three points thanks to a dominant performance from the defense and the Revs were unable to find the back of the net.

Here are my observations:

-The Fire defense was very good throughout the match. The Fire had 16 shots, and had only one unsuccessful clearance.

-The Fire were able to get the ball forward consistently throughout the match, and were able to put the Fire on the board on two different occasions.

-The Fire were able to create dangerous opportunities for their attack by finding the back of the net.

-The Fire defense was very good in defense, and the Revs were unable to find the back of the net.

-The Revs were able to get forward a few times, but were unable to create any significant opportunities.

-The Revolution's defense was very well-disciplined throughout the match.

Quick Walkthrough [ edit ]

Talk to the Dragonborn. Travel to a cave near the entrance to Helgen. Search the chest inside the cave and retrieve the Golden Claw. Return to the Dragonborn.

Detailed Walkthrough [ edit ]

Unlocking the Door [ edit ]

When you first arrive in Helgen, you will find that the first building you see is the College of Winterhold, which is located just south of Helgen and just a short distance from the entrance to Helgen Keep itself. You will probably also notice that the city has a very dark and cold feel. In this case, the cave outside of the College is the source of the problem.

If you want to find a way to get inside the cave, there is one way. Just head south from the College of Winterhold and you'll find a small cave with a load of snow and ice. Follow the small path and you will find a chest guarded by a Forsworn Briarheart. The chest's contents are a very common item: a Golden Claw. If you have any magicka, you can use a Frost Salts spell on the claw to make it more useful, or you can use a Silver Sword to make it even more powerful.

The only catch is that you will need to use a Golden Claw on a chest in the cave. There is a small passage about ten feet behind the chest, so you need to enter the cave with the Golden Claw in your hand. Once you enter the cave, head down a couple of steps and turn right (east). The Golden Claw is in the hallway and the chest is on the other side of the wall.

It is possible to reach the chest without the Golden Claw, but it requires a bit of luck and a

The post-Brexit world is not a happy place. With the pound plummeting, the pound-euro exchange rate at its lowest level in three years, and the City of London's stock market plummeting, it's easy to forget just how much the financial sector in the UK has changed since the vote to leave the EU.

The rise of the City of London in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and its subsequent dominance, was driven by a need to finance the industrial revolution. It was the birthplace of the City of London Corporation, the precursor to the London Stock Exchange, and it was also the birthplace of the Bank of England.

Following the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, the City's fortunes changed. Investment banking went international. With the EU's single market and the so-called City of London Agreement, the financial sector was able to flourish in the rest of Europe without having to follow the rules set out by the EEA, which was created in 1992.

One of the key changes since the 'Brexit' vote has been the close integration of the City of London and the rest of the UK. It is now one of the most important financial centres in the world, and it is likely to remain so until at least 2021, when the City of London is due to host the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB).

But even though the City is growing in importance, it is not immune to the change, and the City is feeling the strain.

The pound has plunged sharply against the US dollar and the euro, with the pound's decline since the referendum on 23 June making the pound, which once traded at 113.4 pence to the dollar, today worth just 77 pence, at one point. The UK government's plans to introduce a "Brexit tax" on financial transactions are also well under way.

It's not just the pound, the City has also been hit by a big drop in the value of its City stock. The FTSE 100, which covers the City's biggest companies, is down more than 5% this year. It has fallen by more than 8% in the last 12 months, and is down more than 20% in the last year.

The other big concern for the City is the fact that London's financial sector is facing a massive structural change.

As the City of London's financial sector becomes even more international, it is likely to attract many foreign investors, which means that the UK's financial sector will become even more internationalised. This is because the City's share of UK finance will be increasingly diluted.

The City is already internationalised, with more than 60% of its corporate finance coming from outside the UK, and this will only increase as it becomes even less US-centric.

And as the City becomes even more internationalised, it is likely to attract a higher proportion of foreign investment. The wider UK economy is likely to suffer as a result.

The City's rise was largely driven by the need to finance the industrial revolution. It is now facing a structural change

It is hard not to be gloomy about the future. The City may have made a very successful transition to the post-Brexit world, but it is now facing a very difficult challenge.

As the City has become more internationalised, it has become more vulnerable to the changes it faces.

That's probably why I got married in the church, and I'm sure that's why the people in my ward were so warm and welcoming. I don't regret my decision, but I did feel like I had to do something to make the church make sense to me. I want people to feel like they can come to the church and feel like they are welcomed, and that they are not being judged by their beliefs.

He had left office in January and, as he went on, he talked about it: his failure to end the war in Iraq, his failure to put the Afghan war to a successful conclusion, his failure to secure a peaceful end to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

But, in the process, he also said many of the things he hadn't in office. There was the US response to the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that was "unprecedented in the history of the world", but it didn't stop him from saying the same thing in the 2012 election.

"The United States has been the world's leader in confronting terrorism since that day," he said.

There was the fact that the US had been the only country to fly over the North Korean nuclear test site in December, but that didn't stop him from saying the same thing in the 2012 presidential election.

"We are going to continue to take all necessary steps to ensure that our allies and our partners in the region are secure," he said.

There was the fact that the US had stopped the killing of civilians in Iraq, but that didn't stop him from saying the same thing in the 2012 presidential election.

What changed in Obama's later statements was that he needed to start admitting to his mistakes. He was confident that he had done enough to end the war in Iraq, but now that the war was in his rear view mirror, he needed to start saying things that might convince people that he didn't, in fact, do enough.

The fact that he had avoided saying the word "Afghanistan" for over a year, as if doing so would somehow make him seem less culpable, only made people more suspicious of him. The fact that he refused to say the words "Pakistan" and "Somalia" in the same sentence only made people ask more questions.

As CNN noted in an article published on December 30 last year, the fact that Obama wouldn't say the words "Pakistan" and "Somalia" in the same sentence only made people more suspicious of him

The piece was headlined: "Obama: Lose the war on terror or lose your legacy".

And the downside of that legacy-building process is that Obama has made no effort to improve the lives of the people he left in power in the countries he left the war in.

"Mr. President," wrote CNN's Jim Sciutto, "the American people are asking the hard questions. Do you think the US left behind enough security in Afghanistan and Pakistan to prevent attacks such as the one on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans? Do you think the US left behind enough political space for the Taliban to control Afghanistan? And do you think the US left behind enough space for the al Qaeda terrorist network to operate?"

This is a particular problem for Obama, because the American people have grown increasingly frustrated by the failure of the war in Afghanistan to produce any results.

"The US is facing the most serious security challenge it has faced since the end of the Cold War," said the New York Times' Eric Schmitt. "The Afghan war is in shambles, its leaders are unwilling to relinquish power, and the Taliban have been allowed to regroup and regroup."

Instead of trying to make things better with the people he left in power in the countries he left the war in, Obama's response is to try and make things worse. In his decision to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan, Obama is trying to create a safe space for the Taliban to regroup, regroup, regroup.

The Taliban are not going to be defeated in Afghanistan. They are not going to be defeated in Pakistan. And they are not going to be defeated in Iraq. They will be defeated in Syria, in Yemen and in Libya, where they are currently fighting the government of Muammar Gaddafi.

But the Obama administration is looking not only to make things worse, it is looking to make things worse forever.

"You can't get around the fact that let's say, the next five years is going to be a very challenging year for the country, for the world, for our country, the world."

In an interview with CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, President Barack Obama made clear why he's determined to enact a new executive action on immigration.

"You can't get around the fact that let's say, the next five years is going to be a very challenging year for the country, for the world, for our country, the world," Obama said. "We're going to have a lot of tough conversations around the world."

Obama said he's hopeful that the first executive action the president takes will help "change the tone" on immigration, but he's not sure it will do much.

On Friday, Obama announced that he will issue an executive action that will shield an estimated 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation, a move that has drawn outrage from Republicans and some Democrats.

Obama said the administration is considering other options for implementing the immigration action. That includes executive action through executive action, or legislation, and he also said he's considering a public-service announcement.

On Sunday, Obama was asked how he can be confident that he'll convince Congress to pass a bill.

"It's going to require some courage. It's going to require some backbone. It's going to require us to have a conversation that doesn't just center on politics, because politics will be the short end of the stick," he said. "But it's going to require us to actually try to find ways to get immigration reform done in a way that doesn't split the country up along the lines of what we think is right, and what we think is wrong. It's going to require us to be open to the possibility of compromise on a lot of things. It's going to require us to be willing to walk away if it's necessary."

Obama said that he's not sure what will happen in Congress when it comes to immigration reform.

"I'm not sure that we ever really know what Congress is going to do," he said. "I think we can be reasonably confident, though, that the Republicans' most important message is that they're going to oppose any kind of comprehensive immigration reform."

When asked whether he's willing to compromise with Republicans on immigration reform if they are willing to compromise on taxes, Obama said he has not had conversations with members of Congress on the issue, but he said he's willing to do so.

"I'll be honest, I've not had conversations with members of Congress on this issue, but I'll be honest with you, if they're willing to compromise, I'm willing to compromise," he said. "I've also said before that I support a pathway to citizenship for people who are here illegally. And I think we've got to be willing to compromise on something like that."<|endoftext|>The European Parliament's chief negotiator on the UK's Brexit divorce bill has conceded that the EU would be happy to accept a lower figure than the £50bn demanded by the UK.

The European Parliament's chief negotiator on the UK's Brexit divorce bill has conceded that the EU would be happy to accept a lower figure than the £50bn demanded by the UK.

Spokesman Guy Verhofstadt told the Irish Parliament it was "well understood" that the EU would not pay a "gross amount" of money in the negotiations.

He added that the EU had made a "very generous offer" to the UK, and that the pound's fall in value to the dollar had provided a "very good" illustration of the UK's "demands".

The European Commission had made clear that it would not accept a figure of £50bn, and its chief negotiator Michel Barnier said a lower figure should be considered.

Mr Verhofstadt's comments come as the EU prepares to release its negotiating guidelines for the Brexit talks next week.

The guidelines are likely to be the first official EU negotiating position on Britain's exit from the EU, which will be published on November 6.

The first official position on Brexit will be published in the EU's Official Journal on November 6.

In the new documents, which will be published alongside the European Council's guidelines, the commission will set out its approach to the UK's withdrawal from the union, with a focus on the future relationship.

The guidelines will be aimed at providing the most detailed possible set of terms that the EU can accept in order to move on to discussions on future trade and customs relations.

Last week, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that the EU was willing to start talks on a transition period within two years if the UK agreed to certain conditions.

The guidelines will be published in tandem with the UK's draft negotiating objectives, which are due to be published

The most influential voice on the Internet is now a company, Google.

Google (GOOG) announced Thursday that it had acquired the mapping and location-based services company Waze for $1.1 billion.

"As the Internet evolves, people need a simple way to get directions and find the things they need to get around, and Waze is the best platform to do just that," Google said in a statement.

Waze, which says it has 40 million registered users in more than 150 countries, has already been integrated into Google Maps and easily integrated into Google Search, Android and the Maps app on iOS and Android phones.

"Waze was created to fill a real need for users," said Ram Shivakumar, CEO of Google. "We believe this acquisition is another step forward for our mission to make the world's information universally accessible and useful."

Waze has been around for a few years, but Google bought it in 2012 for a reported $50 million.

Related: Google dominates in mobile search

The acquisition is part of Google's attempt to acquire a number of top mapping and location-based services. The company has long been investing in mapping and location-based services, and has acquired a number of companies in this space recently.

When Google (GOOG) acquired the mapping and location-based services business of Nokia (NOK) in 2014, it was one of the biggest acquisitions of that year.

Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) also made major acquisitions of mapping and location-based services companies in recent years.

But Google's recent acquisitions have been smaller, smaller deals. The company just bought the photo-sharing service Instagram for $1 billion, while it also bought the mapping company Waze for a reported $50 million.

Waze's users can now use Google Maps to get directions, and can also see real-time traffic updates. But it's unclear how much money Waze makes from those services, and it has not said how much it will pay to Google.

"Our primary goal is to make the world's information universally accessible and useful," said Shivakumar. "We believe that a global community of people who use Waze will be more motivated to share their experiences and create a better, more connected world."

Waze started off as a mobile mapping app, before pivoting to a desktop-based service. But like many others -- including MapQuest (MARKET) -- Waze has seen its fortunes decline.

"We're very excited to be joining forces with Google," said Waze co-founder and CEO Bas Wisselink. "They're a leader in search and mobile, and we're excited to continue to build out the Waze app for Android and iOS."<|endoftext|>LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is to launch its first domestically produced rocket in a bid to compete with the US, Russia and China in the space technology sector, said officials and industry officials.

Pakistan will send its first geosynchronous satellite on a launch vehicle it is developing and expects to make use of the space technology in national security, scientific and industrial applications, the officials said.

Pakistan's space and defence industries will be able to compete with other countries, they said.

"We have to make a start. We have to learn how to do it ourselves, and we have to learn from others," said an official in the Aviation Research and Development Organisation (ARDO), a government-run research organisation.

ARDO is leading the space programme in Pakistan, and is also one of the lead contractors for developing a prototype of the Ariane 6 rocket, a vehicle Pakistan is working on to launch satellites.

"We have to learn how to do it ourselves, and we have to learn from others."

"We are trying to do it within the country and to make our own products. It has to be a local technology. We have to make our own technology," said the official.

But he added that the space industry would be competitive with the US, Russia and China.

The launch vehicle being developed by ARDO is known as the Geo-Astro 3 (GA-3) and will have a launch range of 2,100km. It is designed to send up to four satellites in a single mission.

The first geosynchronous satellite will be launched on the GA-3 in the second half of this year, said the official.

"The first generation of satellites will be used for weather forecasting and disaster management. The second generation will be used for scientific and industrial applications," he said.

He said Pakistan was working on a geostationary satellite with a launch range of 3,000km.

"We are looking at the Indian climate satellites, but we have to look at our own," he said.

Bill Clinton has told US voters he wants to be a "real part of the change" in 2016, saying the country has begun to heal.

The former president said he was "very, very proud" of his wife's campaign.

"I have some issues with her, but I have to say, I'm very, very proud of her," he told ABC's This Week.

Hillary Clinton has faced criticism for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.

Mr Clinton, who has endorsed his wife for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he was not suggesting Mrs Clinton was not honest in her emails, adding there should be "tougher" rules on record keeping.

"I'm not suggesting that she was not honest. I'm saying we've gone beyond what's necessary with the rules," he said.

"I think it's fair to say that for two decades her family has been doing things in public that they would never do in private."

He also said that he did not think Mrs Clinton had broken any laws, but said there "should be tougher rules" on record keeping.

"I'm not suggesting that she was not honest. I'm saying we've gone beyond what's necessary with the rules," he said.

Mr Clinton also said he felt "great" about watching his wife's campaign unfold.

"She has been a champion for many, many years, and she has done a great job," he said, adding he was proud of the campaigning she had done.

Mr Clinton said he was more confident than ever that his wife would be the next president.

"I think she's going to be the next president of the United States," he said.

"I think she's going to have an overwhelming victory in the Democratic primaries.

"I think she's going to win the general election. I think that she's going to be more popular than any president that we've had, and I don't think there's any question about that."

Mr Clinton also hailed his wife's success as a "miracle" and defended her as "honest and trustworthy".

"I've never had a woman president, and I don't think any of us who have had a woman president have ever had a responsibility to act like we had to, but Hillary Clinton is a terrific woman," he said.

"She's got a very good heart and I think she's going to be a great president."

Mr Clinton's interview comes after his wife was criticised for her use of the private email server while she was secretary of state.

Mrs Clinton used a private server for all of her work emails, which was in violation of state Department rules, and has since apologised for her actions.

Mr Clinton said in the interview: "I was not aware of the server that she used until it was revealed."

He said Mrs Clinton was "very, very smart" and did "a great job".

He said the controversy surrounding her email scandal had "given a lot of people pause" but added that the former secretary of state had been "steadfast in the face of all the attacks".

'I'm not going to concede anything'

Mr Clinton has previously said he would not concede the White House race without his wife being the nominee.

However, he told ABC: "I'm not going to concede anything until July, because we've got a long road ahead of us."

He added: "I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that Hillary Clinton is elected president."

Mr Clinton was questioned about his age and whether he could run for a third term in the White House.

He said: "I'm not going to concede anything because I've said I can do it.

"If we do a good job, if we get the nomination, then I'll be happy to think about my future."

BOSTON — A judge ordered a Boston-area funeral home and crematorium to pay a woman in her 70s more than $2 million after the company hired a former construction worker to build their facilities and failed to pay him according to his contract.

The case, which the U.S. Attorney's Office says could set a federal precedent, stems from the death of Elizabeth Vassallo of Westborough, Mass.

A summary of the case against M&C Cremation Services Inc. filed in federal court in Boston describes a series of events that led to Vassallo's death.

According to the lawsuit, Vassallo was paid $4,000 a month for her work as a burly chainsaw operator at the funeral home's shop. On another occasion, the lawsuit said, she was assigned to use a "sledgehammer" to build a water tank in the shop, but was instead required to raise rock walls with a chain saw.

The lawsuit said she was paid only $150 a month for her work as a chain saw operator at the crematorium, a job that involved lifting up to two tons of bodies and disposing of them in a vat of acid.

"Ms. Vassallo was paid more than the minimum wage for her work and was not paid at all for the work she did not perform," the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit said Vassallo, who had been a longtime customer at the funeral home, asked to be paid for some of the work she did as a chainsaw operator, but the company refused. The lawsuit said the company also failed to pay Vassallo for the work she did as a burly chainsaw operator.

Vassallo died in September 2011, but the funeral home and crematorium went into bankruptcy in 2013. Last year, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts ordered the company to pay Vassallo more than $1.3 million in restitution and fines.

In the lawsuit, the funeral home and crematorium were named as defendants. The case is named in her name because the company was her employer at the time of her death.

The lawsuit said the company was under investigation for more than 30 previous workplace violations, including two cases involving death and serious injury.

The attorney for the Vassallo family, David J. Cohen, said the family was pleased with the outcome.

"I would say the main takeaway is that the court came down on the side of the worker in every respect," Cohen said. "They made sure that the company was held accountable for the violations that they had committed in the past. They also brought in a special master, who was an expert in the field who did a thorough analysis of the company's operations and what went wrong."<|endoftext|>When a guy walks into the bathroom of a gay bar, what do you do?

If you're the guys who have made a career out of watching straight men fawn over men, then you sit back and laugh.

Or if you're a man yourself, you start to wonder what the hell was wrong with those guys.

It's the same here at The Advocate, where we've been having a really good run of it with our "One Thing We Do Know About Men" series.

We get lots of emails from readers who are confused about dating, so this week we asked our regular contributor, Jenni Koop, to explain to us how men date and what men do when they're cruising.

The answer: When a man walks into a gay bar, he wants to see what the women there are wearing.

There's a long history of male culture focusing on the female form, and in the gay community that means focusing on the female body.

So in a way, you can argue that women are the ones who have dominated every part of male culture in the past, and the gay community has a long history of disrespecting women.

But that doesn't mean women are stupid. If you really looked at women, you'd see that they were much more intelligent than men.

The reason why women rule the world is because they have to. As the gender in charge, they have to take care of the needs of everyone, from children to spouses to business executives.

Men, on the other hand, don't have to take care of any of those things because they don't have to take care of anyone but themselves.

That's why, when a man walks into a gay bar, he wants to see what women are wearing.

======================================== SAMPLE 183 ========================================
It's been a rough couple of weeks for the U.S. women's national soccer team. On Monday, it was announced that the team would not be playing in this summer's Olympic Games in Brazil. Then, on Tuesday, it was announced that the team's star player, Abby Wambach, wouldn't be playing in women's soccer either. This comes as a complete surprise, as Wambach is one of the most accomplished soccer players in history. She has won five World Cup titles and three Olympic gold medals. But just because she's accomplished doesn't mean she should be forced to sit out.

Why should she be forced to sit out? Because she's a woman.

Wambach is 32 years old. It's not uncommon to see female athletes, like the aforementioned Abby, play through injury and fatigue. But Wambach's injury is not a normal one. She has a torn meniscus that will keep her out for the next six months, and a torn ACL that will keep her out for the next four months.

When you consider that these injuries stem from her playing soccer, they're shockingly difficult to recover from. As a result, Wambach will be sidelined for the first half of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. As a consequence, she'll miss the 2014 World Cup and, for the second half of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the U.S. will be without its best striker.

It's a devastating blow for a team that is primed to make a deep run in the tournament. It's a devastating blow for Wambach, who is one of the world's best players and a beloved figure in American soccer circles. And it's a devastating blow for American women's soccer, which has "the most talented roster in the history of the sport," as ESPN's Doug McIntyre put it.

However, it's not just the injuries that have Wambach in the crosshairs, since she's also a tactical genius who helped the U.S. win the 2011 World Cup. And it's not just the injuries that have the team in the crosshairs, since Wambach has been outspoken about the need for more women's professional soccer.

As a response to women's professional soccer, Wambach launched the NWSL in 2011. She lobbied the U.S. Soccer Federation to allow the league to compete in the World Cup. She spoke passionately about the need for more women's professional soccer in the United States. She even suggested creating a separate league for women, which is a serious proposal that would make a lot of sense.

Women's soccer in the United States is in a state of transition. The U.S. Women's National Team and the WNBA have been around for decades, while the WPS has existed since 1999. But, as a result, there are fewer women's games on TV and more women's soccer players are playing in the NWSL than ever before. Clearly, more women's professional soccer is a good thing.

But there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned about the situation. For one, Wambach is one of the most popular players on the team. She's the face of the team and she has a tremendous voice, as her Twitter account and appearance on ESPN's SportsCenter attest.

But another problem for the team is that Wambach already has a verbal contract with the U.S. Soccer Federation. She has to abide by the federation's rules, and, as a result, she's not going to be able to play for the national team.

There's also the issue of the U.S. women's national team's image. As a matter of fact, the U.S. women don't even have a good image, as former U.S. women's national team player Brandi Chastain argued in an op-ed for The New York Times. "There is something deeply wrong in our culture that allows one of the most beloved and admired women in all of sports — a woman who had the courage to play the game she loves for a living — to be dismissed by her peers and her countrymen simply because of her gender," Chastain wrote.

And finally, there is the issue of Wambach's vocal support for women's pro soccer. In 2012, Wambach pledged to raise millions for a women's professional soccer team. She also used her platform to speak out on behalf of the NWSL. She wrote an op-ed for ESPN the Magazine in 2012 about why women's professional soccer is important.

"I am trying to make the argument that women's soccer should be treated like professional sports, like other sports," she wrote at the time

That's the question asked by residents in a video posted to Facebook.

The video was posted on the campaign website of council candidate Omari Waker.

The online video shows the comments made by Waker, who is running for council in the city of St. John's.

"I know that there are a lot of people out there who have expressed their concerns and their concerns have been heard," Waker said in the video.

Waker has said he would like to meet with residents who have complained about the city's recent high-profile problems with pedestrian collisions.

Many of the comments come from people who live near the locations where collisions have occurred.

Waker said he would like to meet with the residents and hear their concerns.

"I think it's important to meet with people when they have a problem, not just sit there and wait for it to go away," Waker said in the video.

Waker's campaign website says he is running against Coun. Bobby Cox, councillor Dana Fisher, and Coun. John O'Donovan for the seat currently held by Coun. Andrew Foulds.

Waker has said in the past that he would like to go into policing and create a better relationship between police and citizens.

In a dramatic turn of events, the Attorney General of Pakistan has confirmed that the Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack on Karachi airport.

The Taliban have also claimed responsibility for the attack in Peshawar and the murder of a Christian pastor.

In a joint press conference with the Pakistani President, Nawaz Sharif, the Attorney General of Pakistan, Zahid Hamid, said that the Pakistani Taliban had claimed responsibility for the attack on Karachi airport.

"The Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack at Karachi airport. The attack was planned and executed by their Taliban members in North Waziristan and the group has taken responsibility for the attack," he claimed.

He added that the Pakistani Taliban are a "terrorist organisation" and that Pakistan is not going to allow the group to "terrorise Pakistan or its people".

The Secretary General of the Quetta Shura of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Sirajuddin Haqqani, said that the TTP had attacked the airport in retaliation to the Indian drone strike in North Waziristan.

Writing on Twitter, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is considered one of the most influential commanders of the TTP, said that the TTP had launched the attack on Karachi airport because the drone attack had killed innocent civilians.

Earlier, the Pakistan Army launched a major offensive in North Waziristan, where the Pakistani Taliban are based.

The offensive is aimed at killing the militants and clearing the area of militants in North Waziristan.

On Friday, the Indian Government said that there was no truth to reports that the Indian Army was involved in the air strike that killed Taliban militants at the Pak-Afghan border in North Waziristan.

The offices of the Pakistani Taliban and the Afghan Taliban have been reportedly closed because of the air strike.

Meanwhile, the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee, has condemned the bombing at Karachi airport.

"I'm sure that the people of Pakistan will go back to their normal lives," he said.

The President added that he had spoken to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif regarding the attack.

"I have spoken to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and we have condemned the attack and our two countries have agreed to work together to keep our people safe," the President said.

"We have been in touch with the US government and they have confirmed their condemnation of the attack," the President said.

The drone strike that killed Taliban militants in North Waziristan was "in clear violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity", the President said.

"The United States must now take immediate action to bring to justice those responsible. It is in no one's interest that terrorists can carry out such cowardly attacks," he added.

The lawyer of the pastor murdered by the Taliban said that the attack was a "planned attack" on the church.

"The attack was deliberate and planned. There was no mistake. The area of attack was a church," said Khurram Paracha.

Paracha said that the church was attacked with an explosive device at around 8am on Sunday morning.

"There was a blast and everyone ran into the church. The blast was so powerful it damaged the roof of the church," he said, adding that only the pastor was hurt in the attack.

The bishop of the church said that the attack was carried out by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that is fighting against the Pakistani government.

"This attack was a planned attack on the church. It was carried out by the TTP," said Rafiqul Islam.

The church chairman added that the attack was carried out in response to the killing of innocent civilians by the Pakistani military.

"This attack is in response to the killing of innocent civilians by the Pakistani military," said Islam.

In an interview with Arnab Goswami, the Bishop said that the attack was carried out by militants from the group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, an anti-government militant group that is active in Pakistan's tribal regions.

This is the first time I've used Hangouts. I've used Skype and Google Hangouts, but I discovered Hangouts while doing a Google search for "how to move a YouTube video to my iPhone" and it was the first thing that popped up.

So, I'm using it on my iPhone right now. I'm not using it to Skype people at work. That's not really my intention for it. Hangouts is primarily for meetings, and I have a Skype account for a lot of my work.

I'm using it on my iPhone.

One thing that I had to learn when I started using Hangouts was that I could not use the video chat to call an individual person. Google has this requirement that the person you're calling needs to be able to see the video feed and hear the audio. These are two different things. I know that I can't call people at work and not have them hear the audio in order for them to see the video.

Since I have a full-time job, I am able to add anyone I want to my group. But, it's not necessarily easy to do this. When I try, it takes me a while to add the person. It's easy to add people to my group if they are at work or I can call them on my phone. So, I'm trying to figure out how to add people to my group if I don't have a phone number in my group.

I have already added a few people to my group. I don't want to do this too many times, because I'm trying to keep the group smaller than mine, but I'm also not sure how to do it.

I do have a Google Voice number, but I don't know how to call anyone without getting their phone number, or at least the number of their cell phone. I have a Google Voice number, but I don't know how to call anyone without getting their phone number, or at least the number of their cell phone.

The human placenta and its protective membranes are the major barrier to the uterine blood supply. The current understanding of this barrier is based on the use of different techniques for measuring the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the use of a blood–placenta barrier (BBP) model. In this article we present a study on the effects of rifampin, a broad spectrum antibiotic, on the BBB during pregnancy. Using an in vivo model of pregnant maternally derived placenta and BBB, we observed a substantial decrease in the BBB permeability when the mother received rifampin in the first trimester of gestation, and no effects on the BBB in the second and third trimesters. These results suggest that rifampin is effective in treating placenta-associated infections in pregnant women, and they also suggest that rifampin may improve the placental barrier function and decrease the risk of maternal BBB damage.

Microbiological and pharmacological studies have shown that rifampin, a broad spectrum antibiotic, affects several pathogens, including the human placenta and its protective membranes. The placenta is the major barrier to the maternal blood supply. Rifampin is used as an antibiotic to treat infections in the placenta, and also to prevent infection by certain pathogens in the maternal blood ( 1 ). For example, rifampin is commonly used for the treatment of placental infections in pregnant women. It is also used as an adjunctive treatment for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in pregnant women, and in the prevention of infection caused by Leishmania species. The current understanding of the placenta's role in the mother-infant interaction is based on studies using different techniques, the use of a blood-brain barrier model, and the use of different antibiotics, including rifampin.

Contrary to the results obtained by Fennema et al. ( 3 ), the concentration of the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) binding protein was higher in the first trimester of pregnancy in the group treated with rifampin than in the control group. The difference was not significant (p = 0.34) because the difference in BrdU binding protein between the two groups was not statistically significant (0.38 ± 0.22 vs. 0.31 ± 0.26 pg/mL; p = 0.27).

In the presence of rifampin, the concentration of the β-galactosidase activity was also decreased (p = 0.04) in the presence of the maternal plasma. The β-galactosidase activity was also decreased in the presence of the maternal serum and placenta (p = 0.04). The β-galactosidase activity was also decreased in the presence of the maternal serum and placenta (p = 0.04).

In the presence of rifampin, there was a significant decrease in the concentration of the β-galactosidase activity. The β-galactosidase activity was also decreased in the presence of the maternal serum and placenta (p = 0.02). The β-galactosidase activity was also decreased in the presence of the maternal serum and placenta (p = 0.02). The β-galactosidase activity was also decreased in the presence of the maternal serum and placenta (p = 0.02).

The concentrations of the β-galactosidase activity and the concentrations of the plasma proteins were significantly decreased in the presence of rifampin in all three trimesters ( ). The level of the β-galactosidase activity was significantly decreased in the first trimester in the group treated with rifampin (p = 0.03) and the level of the β-galactosidase activity in the group treated with the maternal plasma was significantly decreased in all trimesters (p = 0.02). The β-galactosidase activity of the placenta was significantly decreased in the first trimester (p = 0.02) and the first and second trimesters (p = 0.02), and was significantly decreased in the third trimester (p = 0.03). The concentrations of the plasma proteins were decreased in all three trimesters ( ).

The concentrations of the concentrations of the concentrations of the maternal proteins were significantly decreased in the presence of rifampin in the first and second

Scary story of how a Catholic priest, after being rejected by a couple on the grounds that they were not married, got married anyway.

A Catholic priest in New York was ordered to pay a $15,000 fine in an unusual civil suit after he was accused of trying to have a gay wedding.

The Rev. Timothy Swann, who was ordained in the Archdiocese of Brooklyn in 2004, was ordered by an administrative judge to pay the fine against him after he was accused of trying to arrange what he thought was a gay marriage.

The couple, who had been dating in 2004, planned to have a marriage ceremony at St. Peter's Church in Queens in September of that year. But the couple was to be denied a wedding by the church, as it was against the church's doctrine to allow same-sex couples to marry.

Instead, the couple, who have not been identified, had planned a "civil ceremony" in which they would get married without official sanction.

The couple requested a priest to perform the ceremony and Swann agreed.

But the couple were told that the church's department of clergy was not allowed to perform civil marriages and that the ceremony would be done by an ordained minister, according to the lawsuit.

Swann, who had been ordained the previous year, agreed to perform the civil ceremony.

But on Sept. 6, 2004, the couple went to the church to have their ceremony. They were accompanied by their parents, who were aware that they were gay.

The couple were not told that the ceremony was illegal and that the church department of clergy had refused to perform the ceremony, according to the lawsuit.

Instead, they were told that the civil ceremony would be conducted by Swann in private.

The next day, the couple went to a hotel where they were to have their civil ceremony.

But when they arrived, they were told that the hotel had closed due to the wedding ceremony.

Instead of going to the hotel, they went to the church, where a priest performed the legal marriage.

The couple were then told that they would have to pay $15,000 in damages, according to the lawsuit.

But the couple refused to pay and a judge ruled in favor of the couple, denying Swann's request for a refund.

According to the lawsuit, Swann was not required to marry the couple and he could have also given them another civil ceremony, which would have been legal and not a civil wedding.<|endoftext|>"The game is going to make a lot more money," says Zenimax Online CEO Matthew Beirne.

The Elder Scrolls Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game that launched in 2011 for PC and Mac and, since launch, has been on a massive online subscription service.

Bethesda Softworks, which co-published the game with Zenimax Online, recently announced that the game had crossed 1 million subscribers, with about 600,000 new subscribers joining the game daily.

In a recent interview with Kotaku, Zenimax Online CEO Matthew Beirne discussed the game's success, and what's in store for the future.

"If we have a subscription service, that'll be the only way we'd bring in more money," he said. "It's a subscription based game, and it's going to have a subscription service. It's going to need to be a subscription based game to make it into the millions, and that's a hard thing to do."

In 2015, President Obama signed the Open Internet Order, which banned ISPs from blocking or slowing Internet traffic or prioritizing certain content.

The rules, which also prohibit blocking or throttling lawful content of their users, went into effect at the start of 2016. That was the end date for the new net neutrality rules.

But the FCC is now on the verge of repealing those rules, which would give ISPs a huge advantage over startups, startups, and small businesses.

The man who was fatally shot by a Texas police officer Friday night was unarmed and had a gun in his hand, officials said.

Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez released the name of the man who was killed, 37-year-old David Joseph Rios, early Saturday morning.

Rios was shot by the officer, but Valdez said the officers were not aware of the situation at the time of the shooting.

The officer was not injured.

"We don't know if there was any relation [between the suspect and the officers], or if the officer was just reacting to the situation," Valdez said.

Valdez said Rios was armed with a gun when he entered the convenience store.

"He entered the store and immediately went to the back of the store and he was confronted by the police officer," Valdez said. "At that point, the officer fired their weapon striking the suspect."

Valdez said the police officer had been with the department for about six years.

The officer was not identified.

Valdez said it was not clear if the suspect had a weapon when he entered the store. Valdez said the store was not locked and the suspect entered when it was open.

"The suspect had no weapon, so the officer was responding to a disturbance in the store," he said.

Valdez said the suspect was conscious after being shot.

Calls to a telephone number listed for Rios on the Dallas Police Department's website were not immediately returned.

The Dallas Police Department is conducting an investigation into the shooting.

"We are still gathering information, and interviewing witnesses," Valdez said.

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said the suspect was armed with a gun and was shot by an officer "for no apparent reason."

"I can tell you that the suspect was armed with a gun, and he was shot by a police officer, for no apparent reason," Rawlings said.

Rawlings said he was not aware of any videos from inside the store showing the confrontation.

"We're going to get the video," Rawlings said.

Dallas Police Chief David Brown said the officer who shot the suspect was placed on administrative leave.

The Falcon Heights Police Department released a statement saying that a "violent confrontation" occurred between two individuals inside the store.

Brown said the officer who fired the fatal shot was not injured.

"This was an attempted murder," Brown said. "I think you go into a convenience store for one thing, and if you pull out a gun and start shooting at people, that is a pretty serious event. It's not unusual for us to get into situations like this."

The officers involved in the shooting were not wearing body cameras, Valdez said. He said the department is also investigating if the officers were wearing the appropriate gear.

The Fort Worth Police Department said it also does not have body cameras on its officers.

"We are not using body cameras on our officers," Fort Worth Police Chief Joel Fitzgerald said. "It's an option, but it's not something we're comfortable with."

Valdez said the officers were not carrying body cameras.

"We don't know if they had them on or not," Valdez said.

Police said they were not aware of any video from inside the store showing the incident.

"We don't know if the officer was wearing the correct equipment," Valdez said. "We're waiting on the investigation to run its course."

Valdez said he had spoken to the Dallas Police Department and the office of the Dallas County District Attorney.

Mesquite Police Chief Mike Brown said he was not aware of the incident and was in communication with Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez.

The Dallas Police Department is also investigating the shooting.

"We are going to look at that, as well as the circumstances surrounding the incident," Valdez said.

Valdez said he had spoken with the Dallas County District Attorney's Office.

"The DA is going to look into all of that," Valdez said.

Valdez said the suspect had suffered multiple gunshot wounds and that he had been taken to the hospital.

Valdez said he knew the suspect had a gun.

"It's strange," Valdez said. "We just don't know. We don't know what happened."

Valdez said authorities would look into whether the suspect was armed.

"We'll be looking at all the facts as we go," Valdez said.

Valdez said he was not aware of any videos from inside the store showing the confrontation.

"We don't know if the officer was wearing the correct equipment," Valdez said. "We're waiting on the investigation to run its course."

The Eagles went down to Manly but were unable to land the win as they ended up losing by just two points to the Sea Eagles.


There were some positives for the club and the coaching staff, with Luke Shuey and Brad Sheppard getting their first career wins in the halves and James Hasson an important player in the back row.


The Eagles have now won four straight games and are now in a strong position to finish the regular season with the wooden spoon.


West Coast's next game is scheduled to be against the St George Illawarra Dragons on Friday night at the SCG.

But there's one glaring omission from the national conversation: The number of children shot and killed in school is on the rise.

In fact, numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that 16-year-old children are more likely to be killed in school than any other age group in the country.

"There is a need for better protection for schoolchildren," says Dr. William Schaffner, an emergency medicine specialist at Vanderbilt School of Medicine. "There is a need to have the laws that would allow the schools to be more proactive in preventing injuries and deaths. But there is a need to prosecute these people when they are involved in shootings."

This is not a new problem — and it's not going away.

A 2013 report by the American School Health Association found that the number of children who died from unintentional injuries at school had more than doubled since 2000.

And just this week, a Minnesota lawmaker introduced legislation that would change the law to make it easier to prosecute people who are in the lines of fire while committing school shootings.

"So let's step back for a second and think about what's going on," says Schaffner, "because when it comes to shootings, it's not just a crime of opportunity. It's a crime of opportunity that we're not doing enough about."<|endoftext|>Quote: Originally Posted by matta0 Originally Posted by I got a phone call from my VZW mobile rep asking if I was purchasing the phone outright or buying with a lease.

The United States and Britain are being urged to bring the global war on terror to an end, with the former defence secretary, Liam Fox, calling for a "new global security framework".

Fox, a leading member of the government's new International Coalition to Counter ISIL, said in an interview with CBC News that "the major powers" should be willing to work together to counter the organisation.

"We're seeing a new global security framework and we need to be part of that global security framework," he said.

"We need to look at ways in which we can work with our allies on a whole-of-government basis, and that's how we are going to defeat ISIL."

Fox said that the main way through which ISIL thrives is through the territory it controls in Iraq and Syria, and that it does not have the capability to attack the United States, despite the group's claims.

"They are not a serious threat to the United States of America, they have no capacity as far as we know to mount any sort of concerted attack on the United States of America," he said.

"But they certainly have a capacity to inspire a lot of people around the world to carry out attacks, and that is something we need to be looking at very closely."

Fox said that the international coalition, which includes Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Jordan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, should be working to provide an "international reporting system" for deaths and injuries.

"In the Middle East you don't have reporting systems. It's really quite hard to get that information in one piece," he said.

"We really need to be open and transparent about what is happening, and I think it's going to be important to do that with the coalition."

The United States has been conducting airstrikes against ISIL targets in Iraq since August, a month after it began an air campaign targeting the group in Syria after it carried out a deadly attack on the US consulate in the country.

The campaign has since lasted more than a year and has killed more than 10,000 ISIL fighters and civilians.

'Time is right'

Fox said that the international coalition is "not yet prepared to talk about a military campaign" against ISIL, and that the UK would be "open" to such a move if it became necessary.

The shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, told Sky News that the UK should not be "naive" about the threat posed by ISIL.

"We have to be ready to act," he said.

"We have to be ready to monitor and we have to be ready to prosecute. It is about time that we did something about it, and I think time is right."

While the US has already launched airstrikes against ISIL targets in Iraq, Britain is currently taking part in air strikes on ISIL targets in Syria.

The UK's Ministry of Defence said that the US and Britain are both considering further air strikes against ISIL targets in Iraq, and that the next step will be the establishment of a coalition air operations centre in Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdistan region in northern Iraq.

The US has warned that it may take "several years" to defeat ISIL in Iraq, but the BBC reports that the effort could be accelerated by the Syrian civil war, which has allowed ISIL to gain footholds in parts of the country.

"The United States is not ready to see the end of ISIL in Iraq, but we will be prepared to see it defeated," Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said on Tuesday.

"We're going to continue to be prepared to undertake such action as it's required to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria, but I want to stress that this is not the end-all, be-all of our efforts against ISIL."<|endoftext|>I wonder if anyone has heard of a writer named Harley S. White who blogged a few years ago about a controversial "science" paper proposing that the absence of a male duck's testicles can predict success in the game of strip poker.

The paper's author, Dr. Robert Green, was a researcher at the University of Michigan. He had previously studied the effect of testosterone on male mice, and had published a study suggesting that males with low levels of testosterone were less likely to be successful in the game.

Very few people actually read the paper. It was widely cited by anti-gay activists, and was cited by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as fact. By the time the paper was published, Dr. Green had resigned from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Michigan, and the paper had been retracted from the journal.

How did he get it published? Well, he attributed it to a "senior scientist", who he also claimed was from the Institute for Creation Research.

The world's top chess player, Magnus Carlsen, has spoken out about allegations he was bullied by his father.

Magnus Carlsen, the world's number one chess player, has spoken out about allegations he was bullied by his father.

Carlsen spoke to the BBC about the allegations made by his father, Magnus Carlsen, who claims his son has been "driven to distraction" by his "troubled" lifestyle.

The Norwegiandigy, who is currently ranked number one, said he was "shocked" by his father's "false accusations" and "extremely disappointed" by them.

Carlsen is currently in London to play the World Chess Championship.

His father told the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet the allegations were "quite clear" and that the "cyber-bullies" of the world were "trying to take him down".

Carlsen's father, a former professional player, was speaking after the Norwegian chess federation banned him from playing in any of its tournaments after he was found guilty of "wilful" cheating.

He was sentenced to two years' probation, a fine of around £12,000 and was ordered to attend a three-month anger management course.

Carlsen, who is currently ranked number one in the world, said he was "uneasy" about the allegations and that his father had "unfortunately" made them "in order to make a statement".

"I was quite shocked about it," Carlsen told BBC Radio 5 live. "I was very disappointed about it. And I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

"I think I've been driven to distraction by some of the things that have been happening."

Carlsen, who is already the highest-ranked Norwegian player, said he had read the report by his father's lawyer which cleared him and said he was "very happy" with "the process".

"I have confidence in the process and I was also pretty sure that I would have been found innocent. I was pretty sure. It's not like I'm being accused of anything that I haven't done before," he said.

"It's just some of the things that have happened in the last few months which have made me think, 'Wow, maybe there are some things that have happened in my life that I haven't been able to put to rest.' And then I had this incident with my dad and there's been a lot of speculation about that and so I was wondering if it might be a good thing to put it to rest and get it all behind me."

Carlsen has been the subject of rumours about his personal life ever since he was a teenager.

He was born in East Germany in 1985 and moved with his family to Norway when he was two years old. He said he has "no idea" where he was born and is not sure of his nationality.

His father, who has been a professional player since 2002 and was once ranked as one of the top 10 players in the world, played in the Norwegian national team from 1999 to 2004.

The allegations against his father come after he was banned from playing in any of the country's top tournaments after being found guilty of "wilful" cheating last month.

Carlsen, who has also admitted to smoking marijuana, admitted he had had "issues" with his father but insisted he was "not worried" about them.

"I think I've been quite lucky in my development and I think I've been pretty lucky. I don't know. I'm not worried about that. I think it's just part of life."

Carlsen's father, who is not the one who gave his son his nickname, has since admitted he is also "lucky to be here" after being banned from playing in the Norwegian national team.

He told the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet: "I think I've been very lucky to be here. I think I've had some issues with Magnus but at the same time I'm very glad that I'm here, I'm very happy."

Carlsen's mother, Lotte, also told the newspaper that she was "very happy" about her son's success.

"I think he has been lucky to be here. I think he has been very lucky," she said. "He has not used drugs. He has not done anything to that extent. He is in a great place and he is very happy with his results."

"I think he is a very special person. I am very happy that he is very well-educated and that he has been able to fulfil his potential."

Carlsen is currently in London to play the World Chess Championship.<|endoftext|>Taste the difference between an American, a British, and a French pâté!

Before the release of this book, the Cabinet Secretariat featured in several of my books. Most of this information is now available in the Ministry of Information, but there was stuff that was not. They didn't want to do things like that. That's why the V.P.S.R.A. (Vayu Sangrah Samiti) was set up in the 1950s. Since then, they have been there. But this book is a document which is a basic, a main source, of information.

This is a document which is a crucial document for the nation, a foundational document of the Constitution. It is the backbone of our national security. It is a historical document, it's a document which is a textbook for our future defence and security. It's a document which is relevant to every citizen, to every state. It's a document which is a document which is a fundamental document of our Constitution.

The Congress government, in New Delhi, didn't want it to be made public because it showed that the Congress government was not in power in 1950s, but it should have been made public because it shows how the Congress government was carrying out its own agenda, which is not very different from the agenda of the BJP today, which is a very important point.

The book is a big document, a big book, and after 10 years of hard work, it's finally going to be published in English in India, it's going to be published in the United States and many other countries. I think it's a big document, a big book.

It's a document which has been kept from the people for a long time, but still, it's very important. It is the biggest book in the world on India and a document which is needed by the people of India.

If you are not aware of it, then you are not a true Indian. If you don't know this document, then you should be ashamed.

I don't think it's a secret. It's a document which was kept from the people for a long time, but still, it's very important. It is the biggest book in the world on India and a document which is needed by the people of India.

The Government of India, in its account of the Vayu Sangrah Samiti, has put out a complete list of the places where books were published. The list is very detailed. It shows that the people who are working in the V.P.S.R.A. have a very good understanding of the Constitution.

I would like to ask you a question. This is a very big question, I am asking you a question, which is in your own book. That is, when you came to power in the 1950s, you had a big battle in the Parliament over the release of books. You had to prevail over the Congress government, which was not in power at that time. What was the point of doing all this?

After the inauguration of the 'Emergency' on the 28th of November 1975, the Congress government did not release any book for two years. On the 28th of November 1975, the V.P.S.R.A. was in power, and they asked V.P.S.R.A. to release books. But the V.P.S.R.A. said that they are not releasing books during the Emergency.

So, they asked me to release the books after the Emergency. We knew the Congress government was not in power in 1950s, but when I came to power in 1955, we had a very good understanding of the Constitution and the role of the V.P.S.R.A. and I felt that it was not right to keep it secret. So, I asked them to release the books after the Emergency.

They had an answer and the answer was that they would release the books after the Emergency. In fact, they did not release the books. So, it was not a secret.

Then, the Congress government came to power. In the late 60s, the Congress government had a very good understanding of our Constitution and I felt that since this was a very important document, that it should be released.

But they didn't release it. So, I decided to do a book on the Constitution. So, I asked the V.P.S.R.A. to release the books. They refused. They said they would only release the books after the Emergency.

So, I decided to do a book. It was in the 1990s, I was getting ready for the launch. I was invited by people like Dr. Amiya Gatapad and Dr. V. Balakrishnan. Dr. Amiya Gatapad told me that he was a friend of J. J. Abdul Kalam and he said that he had read my book. I asked him, "What is your

He was hit by a southbound vehicle. Police say a small child was in the vehicle and transported to hospital with serious injuries.

Police say alcohol was not a factor in the crash.

The driver is described as a white man in his 20s with long, dark hair and a goatee. He was also wearing a black jacket and had a black, sleeveless shirt on.

The child remains in hospital with serious injuries, and remains in police custody.

The victim's identity has not been released.<|endoftext|>A military plane carrying the bodies of five soldiers from the Israeli army was downed by an anti-aircraft missile on Thursday during a routine flight to an air base in southern Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces said.

The Israeli military said the plane was hit by a missile fired from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights.

It said there was no need to conduct a precise investigation, since the plane was not in Syrian airspace and the military did not own the plane.

"This is an isolated incident, and the IDF is not investigating it," the IDF said, adding that the plane did not take part in any military activity in the area.

The air force flew the troops from the Golan Heights to a base in the southern city of Eilat.

The statement came as the army's Chief of Staff Benny Gantz met with the families of the soldiers killed in the incident.

Earlier, Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said the plane was hit at a height of 60 meters (200 feet), in a area controlled by the Syrian regime.

"I'm sure the Syrian army knew what it was doing," he said, adding that the plane was flown in a very dangerous area.

The Syrian regime is believed to have fired the missile in a bid to prevent Israel from bombing its military installations in the area.

The IDF has been conducting an air campaign against Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces in Syria since Sept. 30, in an attempt to prevent the regime from gaining ground there.

Israel and the United States have repeatedly accused Syria of carrying out attacks against Israeli targets, but Damascus has denied the accusations.

Syria has said that Israel has violated several agreements with the country in the past and that it will not give up its sovereignty.

Israel has not carried out airstrikes on Syrian targets since the beginning of the war on Syria's Assad regime.

Earlier this week, the IDF rescued three Jewish settlers abducted by Palestinian militants in the West Bank.

The three were freed following a two-day standoff with the militants and a shootout with Israeli security forces.

The incident came as the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on the situation in Syria, with a Jordanian official calling for an emergency meeting of the council.<|endoftext|>"This is a good year for journalists in Britain," wrote the Guardian's editor Alan Rusbridger in an article in the paper today.

Rusbridger himself had been the subject of a large-scale investigation into the activities of the Guardian by the US Department of Justice. He had been one of several journalists who had written stories alleging that the British government had been involved in the illegal spying on journalists by the National Security Agency. In response, the Guardian was forced to reveal details of a secret agreement it had reached with the NSA which allowed it to continue its work without fear of reprisal.

While the Guardian was able to publish its story without any media backlash, the US government made no secret of its displeasure. The Department of Justice conducted an investigation into the newspaper, which concluded that the Guardian "had engaged in reckless journalistic practices" and that they had "engaged in reckless journalistic practices and committed serious violations of the law." Rusbridger, the Guardian's editor, faced the prospect of up to six months in prison and a potential £1 million fine.

Rusbridger said that the US Department of Justice's decision to raid the Guardian's offices and seize the hard drives of its editors and reporters was a "massacre." "The US government has come to... treat journalists as targets," he said.

The woman who had sex with the former US president in the Oval Office has told the Daily Mail she believes the sex was consensual.

Julie Christie, 53, told the newspaper that she contacted former president Bill Clinton's office after the incident in 1999.

She said: "I was with him at the time, I was a member of his security detail. He had me escorted into the Oval Office and sat down in that chair that had the Bible and his notes.

"I had my hand on the back of his chair as he leaned forward, I was in a state of shock. I was looking at him and he asked me to come in closer."

Ms Christie said she agreed to go in and stay for a while because she thought it was an official meeting.

She explained she had been told to draw a map while Mr Clinton performed oral sex on her, and said that she was later told that the sex was consensual.

She said: "I want to be clear, I want to be crystal clear, that I believe this happened and that this man did not rape me.

"I want to be clear, my story doesn't change the fact that it was a horrible thing he did and that he should not have done it."

Mr Clinton has previously said that the encounter was consensual.

The biggest problem with the new Star Wars movie is how little it's doing to stand alone. Or, well, the biggest problem with it is that Star Wars is a franchise that needs to be supported by a very large number of films, and that the new film is so much less ambitious than its predecessors that there isn't much of a reason to believe that it really is a Star Wars movie.

It's a weird way to open the franchise, even for a franchise that has been trying to keep up with the times for decades. When George Lucas made Star Wars, he was working with a lot of the same filmmaking techniques that make the blockbuster puzzle pieces of late-1990s blockbusters seem so familiar: the pre-credits sequence, the film's endless PR push, the rave reviews, the enormous budget. But Lucas' movies were no longer about the thrill of the chase or the clash of forces. They were about people on the run, trying to survive in an alien world. The films weren't about the hero the hero was supposed to be, but the villain the villain was supposed to be. And the one time they even tried to be about the hero was in the latest one, which was only about the hero the hero was supposed to be doing.

The new Star Wars movie, by contrast, is about Luke Skywalker, a soldier who has been fighting the evil Empire and who has been raised on the idea that the Force is the key to the whole universe. He's come home to find that his father has been killed, his aunt and uncle are going to be executed by the Empire, and he's been left to fend for himself. He's left his home planet, Alderaan, to try to find a way to defeat the Empire. Luke's only got a few pieces of information, which he's got to work out as he goes along.

The film's first act is basically him training with his uncle and training his nephew to fight. It's pretty basic stuff, and the rest of the film shows him building his own ship, which he can't pilot. He goes off to fight in a few skirmishes, and then ends up on a planet where he's trying to find his father. All of this is totally unresolved, as is it's own story.

The problem with the film is not that it's not trying to be a Star Wars movie, but that it's not trying to be anything at all. The whole thing is built around a simple idea of escape. The whole thing is built around the idea that Luke has to escape, that he has to find a way to defeat the Empire. The idea that he's supposed to do that is usually framed as a necessity: Luke is the son of a Jedi, and the Empire is trying to destroy the Jedi, and Luke has to foil the Empire's plot to crush the Jedi.

The problem with the film is that it's an absolutely terrible idea. It's an idea that's never worked, and it's an idea that just doesn't work in the Star Wars universe. The Empire has always been a force for good. The Jedi have always been a force for good. The Empire has tried to wipe out both, and the Jedi have always tended to defeat the Empire. This movie is built around the idea that Luke is supposed to be a Jedi, and he's supposed to defeat the Empire.

The idea of Luke being a Jedi is laughable. And even more laughable is the idea that he's supposed to defeat the Empire. The Empire is a force for good. It's the reason the Jedi exist, and it's the reason they have the strength to defeat the Empire.

This movie's a mess. It's a mess that doesn't really have a clear sense of purpose, and it's a mess that doesn't really have a clear sense of purpose that's consistent about its endgame. It's a mess that is also a mess that seems to have been made by a lot of people who were just as confused as you are.<|endoftext|>UPDATE: The last time we talked to Robert Cialdini he was describing an experiment he'd seen in which a group of students were given a test and then asked to take a break and come back when they could do better. They did better, and not only that, but they also became more attentive to the instructions and tended to work harder. The students who took the break were more attentive and worked harder.

His most recent experiment is a little different. Instead of taking a test, which he says is maybe not the best way to measure student attention, he asks students to play a game of fencing. He gives them a set of rules, and then asks them to fill in the blanks.

"When you finish your piece, just hit the target," he says. "You can get the target to move in any direction. And that's the only way to win. If you miss, you lose."

(CBS News) It was the largest drug bust in history: Hundreds of pounds of cocaine and other drugs, worth up to $5 million, and a huge amount of cash.

But the bust was a bust for the wrong guy.

"They put the wrong guy in the federal prison for a very long time," said Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal James McDonough, who led the operation. "He was not the one doing the drugs."

Twenty-nine-year-old Jose Dominguez-Marin was sentenced last month to 41 years in prison for his involvement in the massive drug bust.

"It's horrible," said Dominguez-Marin's mother, Claudia Marin. "They took him away from us, and he's not going to be able to see his kids. He's not going to have family members who love him anymore."

The federal Bureau of Prisons says Dominguez-Marin was a good young man who was addicted to cocaine, but he was not the mastermind of the seizure, which happened in January.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami, Dominguez-Marin was enlisted by other members of a local drug ring to help move large amounts of cocaine and other drugs from South Florida to the Bahamas.

Dominguez-Marin was arrested in the Bahamas, but he was not the mastermind behind the operation.

"He has been very cooperative. He's very cooperative," said McDonough.

The Miami U.S. Attorney's Office says the real mastermind, a former high-ranking gang member named James "Jimmy" Dominguez, ran the operation.

James "Jimmy" Dominguez was sentenced to 40 years in prison on charges of drug trafficking, money laundering and obstruction of justice in January.

In a statement, the U.S. Attorney's Office said Dominguez-Marin was also used as a courier for other members of the drug ring, and was never a central figure in the operation.

McDonough says Dominguez-Marin was a good kid and a hard worker who was looking for a better life.

"He was an honest young man," said McDonough. "He was smart as a whip. He was hard-working. He was a good kid. He had friends."

Dominguez-Marin's attorney, Bruce Stauffer, says he's not surprised that Dominguez-Marin was not the mastermind of the narcotics operation. Stauffer says Dominguez-Marin was in the Bahamas for a short visit on business.

"It's not a surprise to me at all that the government would try to make a scapegoat for their problem," said Stauffer.

Stauffer says he will fight to overturn Dominguez-Marin's conviction.

If convicted, Dominguez-Marin could be sent to an extremely high-security prison for life.

"For them to send this young man to prison for 41 years for the drugs that they had no idea about, there's no justice in that," said Stauffer.

Dominguez-Marin's family has set up a fund in his name to help cover the cost of his incarceration.<|endoftext|>This has been a very busy week in the world of astronomy. On Wednesday, we reported on a new, intriguing object — known as PKS 2525 — discovered by Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3. Yesterday, we reported on the discovery of a previously unknown planet orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1.

Now, astronomers have also discovered a trio of exoplanets in the habitable zone of a nearby star, and they're all very similar. Two of the planets are "super-Earths," meaning they're larger than Earth, and orbit a dim star, TRAPPIST-1, at a distance of only around 8.6 billion kilometers.

This means that TRAPPIST-1 is the closest exoplanet candidate to be studied in depth, and that scientists can start to learn how Earth-size planets in our own solar system might have formed.

The trio of planets are known as Kepler-22b, Kepler-22c, and Kepler-22d. All three of the planets are close to Earth-size, orbiting their star at distances of 1.1, 1.7, and 2.3 times the Earth-Sun distance, respectively.

Such close-in planets are thought to be the result of processes similar to "super-Earths," but here the process is more similar to how planets form around larger, cooler stars. In this case, these planets are the result of gravitational interactions between the star and the planets, with the star itself acting as a gravitational lens.

The Kepler-22 planets are quite similar to our own solar system, but they're much bigger

The British soccer team that was bullied out of their place at the London 2012 Olympics is not going to be in the game for the 2012 London Games.

The women's soccer team at the London 2012 Olympic Games, called the British team, withdrew from the games after their coach was severely beaten outside his home. The incident was captured on video.

The coach was badly beaten outside his home.

The coach was beaten with a helmet in what appears to be a targeted attack.

Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber said Tuesday the women's team will not be playing in the Olympics and the men's team will not be playing in London.

"I am sorry to say it, but the women's team is not going to be playing in the London Games," Garber said in a statement. "I would like to extend my deepest regrets to the team members and the soccer fans across the world for this outcome.

"I would also like to express my sincere thanks to our partners at the International Olympic Committee and our brave athletes who put themselves in harm's way to defend our shared values and ideals. I am sure London 2012 will deliver a safe competition and an exciting Games, and we wish the British team all the best."

The team's withdrawal from the Olympics is not surprising. It doesn't make much sense for the women's team to play in the Olympics two weeks after their coach was badly beaten. It's hard to imagine any team that doesn't play in the Olympics being able to compete.

The men's team, which had been slated to play in the Olympics, will be competing in the 2012 London Olympics.

The British soccer team had been scheduled to play in the women's competition.

This isn't the first time the British soccer team has been attacked.

In 2008, the team was attacked in the streets of London.

"The British team was attacked by muggers in London in 2008 and are not going to be competing at the Olympics in 2012," Garber said in a statement reported by the BBC.

"I want to say to the team that we are so sorry that you have been attacked, but we are proud of you for stepping up to the moment to defend your country. We will be in touch and will make sure the team is supported and provided with the necessary support as they embark on their journey to London."

The team is still scheduled to participate in the 2010 World Cup. The team is playing in the World Cup in Germany this year.

The team has no plans to withdraw from the World Cup.

The Team GB women's soccer team was attacked this week.

For now, soccer fans in London will have to make do with the men's team.

The British soccer team was scheduled to play in the Olympics, but they are not going to be playing.

The foundation, which has been the target of attack from Donald Trump, has come under fire after it was revealed that the State Department approved a request from the foundation to accept donations from foreign governments.

The controversial donations from foreign governments have been a source of controversy for Hillary Clinton for years.

Trump has repeatedly attacked Clinton for accepting millions of dollars from foreign governments, but he has faced criticism from Republican opponents for not releasing his tax returns.

The New York Times reported that the State Department and the Clinton Foundation were both notified of the donations to the foundation, some of which were large and some of which were small.

It is not clear how much the foundation has accepted from foreign governments since Clinton became secretary of state, but the organization has said it has accepted $10 billion from abroad.

The Clinton Foundation also has faced accusations of pay-to-play politics, as well as accusations of a conflict of interest.

During a television appearance on Fox News Sunday, Trump said that he had no idea if the foundation had accepted money from foreign governments.

He said: "I don't know if they have. But they've taken millions and millions of dollars. And they're a disaster. They've taken tens of millions of dollars."

Trump has also suggested that he would "look into" the Clinton Foundation to see if it is receiving money from foreign governments.

He said: "There's a lot of problems with the foundation. It's a criminal enterprise. It's a scandal. It's one of the great frauds in politics. It's one of the greatest scams of all time."

Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told ABC's This Week that the campaign was not concerned about the issue, despite recent reports.

"I have been experiencing these dreams since I was sixteen years old," said Dickson. "I first had them in the Fall of 2010 and they have continued since then. The dreams have been the same for me since the beginning of my life. I believe that my dreams are connected to my subconscious mind. I have tried to communicate with my subconscious mind and sometimes I have been in contact with it."

The Dickson family said they have also received some messages of help from the community.

"I have met with several people from the community who have experienced the same dream," Dickson said. "They have been very helpful in a lot of ways."

Dickson said her family has experienced a lot of grief, but they are more determined than ever to move forward.

"My family is extremely grateful for the incredible support and prayers we have received from all over the world," she said. "While the past three years have been a true struggle, we are determined to get through it. We are turned the corner and are ready to go on with our lives."

Since the Dicksons' story came to light, there have been many calls from the public who have reached out to the family.

"We have had calls from as far away as Australia, Germany, England, and even St. Louis, MO," said Dickson. "We have had people from all over the country tell us that they have had the same dreams. We have had people from all walks of life connect with us and tell us that they too have had the same dream."

Dickson said there are still many questions left unanswered.

"We want to know who has been driving the car and why!" she said. "We want to know how the vehicle has entered our dream and why it has been able to stay there for so many years."

Dickson said she is looking forward to moving forward with her life.

"We are very happy to be free of the vehicle and are looking forward to a new day," Dickson said. "I want to thank everyone who has helped us get so far this far."<|endoftext|>The American people have spoken.

They want the federal government to stop funding Planned Parenthood.

Nearly three-quarters of Americans, including Republicans, want Planned Parenthood to be defunded, according to a new poll by Morning Consult.

Forty-seven percent of respondents responded that they wanted Planned Parenthood to be defunded. Thirty-one percent said they thought Planned Parenthood should continue receiving taxpayer funding, but they wanted Planned Parenthood to stop providing money for abortions.

Just 20 percent said that they wanted Planned Parenthood to stay funded.

Thirty-seven percent of Republicans said that they wanted Planned Parenthood to be defunded, while 33 percent said that they favored taxpayer funding for the organization. Just 15 percent said that the organization should continue receiving taxpayer funding.

The federal government does not currently provide funding for Planned Parenthood. The organization receives about $500 million in taxpayer funding each year.

The poll also found that the public is split on whether or not Planned Parenthood should be allowed to receive federal funds for contraception.

Forty-seven percent of people said that Planned Parenthood should be allowed to receive federal funds for contraception, while 32 percent said that they should not.

Forty-five percent of respondents said that they disagreed with Planned Parenthood receiving federal funds for contraception.

People were also divided on the issue of abortion, with 40 percent of respondents saying that abortion should be allowed in all or most cases. Forty-one percent said that abortion should be allowed in only a few cases. Just under half the respondents said that they disagreed with abortion being allowed in all or most cases.

The polling firm conducted the poll from May 31 to June 6, just after the release of a series of undercover videos by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress.

If you're a fan of the IKEA catalogue, you'll know that the idea of a modular kitchen is a pretty big deal. The IKEA modular kitchen was a fairly long time coming and when it finally arrived, there was an array of equipment that had never been seen before, including a meat slicer, an oven, a dishwasher, a coffee maker, a range, a toaster, a mini fridge, and even a clothes basket. It's not just IKEA that's been thinking outside the box with their modular kitchen, though, with a host of other manufacturers like Build Your Own and Simplicity also creating their own take on modular kitchen designs.

One of the most interesting modular kitchen appliances to hit the market recently is the Möve prototype. The Möve is a modular kitchen that features the ability to switch out the cooking surface, oven, and toaster, and the rest of the furniture with anything from a coffee table to a couch to a picnic table. It is a clever idea that makes the impact that modular kitchens can have in a home a lot more noticeable.

Unfortunately, the Möve is not yet available in the UK, but luckily there are a number of places you can order it from right now. For example, you can buy it on Amazon UK for £19.99 plus shipping, or on Amazon US for $29.99.

The Möve is not the first modular kitchen appliance to come to the UK either. While it's a bit disappointing that the Möve isn't currently available here, the idea of modular kitchen appliances has been around for a while now, and most of the modular kitchen appliances available in the UK have been developed in the US or Japan.

The US says it has carried out a drone strike in Pakistan, killing a senior militant leader.

The strike was the first of its kind in Pakistan and killed Hafiz Saeed, a close aide to Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, the Pentagon said.

The attack came two weeks after President Donald Trump announced a new strategy for countering al-Qaeda and Islamic State militants.

Pakistan's government condemned the strike.

"Pakistan strongly condemns such an illegal and barbaric action by the US. Such actions only increase the hatred of Pakistan's people towards the US," Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told the media.

The death of Hafiz Saeed, a close aide to Hakimullah Mehsud and founder of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), was confirmed by the US Central Command.

A statement on the US defence department's website said: "The United States conducted a drone strike in the Waziristan tribal region of Pakistan today (Tuesday), killing Hafiz Saeed, a senior commander of the LeT and a designated global terrorist."

Officials did not elaborate on the identity of the militant or the nature of the operation.

The US considers LeT a terrorist organisation, but it is not known whether Mr Saeed was among the group's top leadership.

The US has carried out several attacks in Pakistan this year, including a missile strike on a hospital and a drone strike on the Pakistani-American scientist who was kidnapped in May.

A US drone strike on Saturday killed two suspected members of a militant group in an attack in North Waziristan, officials said.

The group, called the Haqqani Network, has been blamed for several attacks on US troops in Afghanistan.

Mr Saeed was a close aide to Mehsud, the leader of the Afghan Taliban (TTP), and was believed to have played a major role in planning the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in which 166 people were killed.

The US also blames the Pakistani military for failing to prevent the attacks.

Hafiz Saeed has established a close relationship with Hakimullah Mehsud, the TTP's chief.

Hafiz Saeed, who has been taken into protective custody by Pakistani authorities, was arrested in 2009 for his alleged role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

He was released by the Pakistani authorities in 2014, but was rearrested in January.<|endoftext|>(The Daily Caller) – A "psychotic" former employee of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been arrested for allegedly plotting to blow up a federal building and kill President Obama.

BENGALURU: The former Gujarat chief minister and Congress MP Narendra Modi has complained of "bureaucratic harassment" in Bengaluru, where he has been kept in a suite of his own, and demanded a "class action" against the city.Modi, who had last week taken over as the BJP's chief ministerial candidate from his cousin, said: "I have been subjected to a lot of harassment. I am not a person to be intimidated. I feel the Congress has exerted pressure on the city administration and government to keep me away from my constituency. I request the people in this city to take a class action against the city administration and government, because they have created a situation where any person can be harassed in this manner."He also asked the people of the state to vote for him as he has "spent a lot of time in the city to study the subject of development".The former CM was elected to the Bengaluru Lok Sabha seat from the city in the 2004 assembly elections. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from the city in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2014.Modi, who was also by then the BJP's chief ministerial candidate in Gujarat, had sought to raise his profile in the city following his accession to the party's top post in Gujarat.In his letter, he said the BJP has "insisted on my staying away from my constituency in Bengaluru and in the last one month I have been subjected to a lot of administrative harassment which is not in the interest of the people of my constituency".He said: "In view of the above circumstances I request that you disqualify the chief minister and the government of Bengaluru. I also request that you declare a class action against the city government and the chief minister."<|endoftext|>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally, Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2016, in Hazard, Ohio.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Donald Trump is coming to Mississippi, and his campaign wants its supporters to know the candidate is not afraid of the black vote.

The Republican presidential nominee is scheduled to hold a rally Friday night in opposition of the death penalty and against the failed policies of Democratic President Barack Obama.

He's also scheduled to be joined by a woman who's become a symbol of the ongoing struggle for voting rights.

On Tuesday, August 17, the nation's largest civil rights group will hold a rally in Jackson to denounce Trump's rhetoric and policies on issues of race, gender and class.

"He's a white supremacist, and he's a bigot," said Erica Garner, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 after being put in an illegal chokehold by a New York City police officer.

In comments that have become a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement, Garner said Trump had a history of using language that promotes racial division. Trump has repeatedly said that a federal judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University is biased because he's Mexican, and his campaign has accused the judge of being 'Mexican.'

Weeks before the New York primary, Trump tweeted, "If the media, and the Democrats, don't cover the Trump phenomena with enthusiasm & vigor, I will not do business in that market."

Garner said she and other civil rights activists are planning Friday's event and "we're going to make sure that people know that there is a candidate out there, who's running for president, that has fought for civil rights, who has fought for voting rights, for equal pay. And that he's a person that people can take a look at. That he's not a racist, he's not a bigot. And we're here to make sure that people know that."

The Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, on Wednesday released a "racial justice platform" that includes a call for federal criminal justice reform and an increase in the federal minimum wage.

On Wednesday, the Clinton campaign released a video titled, "Trump's Dangerous Ideas," which features testimonials from Trump supporters who say the candidate has never discriminated against them based on their race, gender or religion.

"He has been so outspoken on the issues of discrimination," said Emmett Mitchell, an African-American from Mississippi who says he is a Trump supporter. "I think he has really taken it on the chin."

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the planned Jackson rally.

The Mississippi State Democratic Party also is supporting Garner's effort to derail Trump with a rally Saturday night in Jackson.

"We are going to talk about the things that concern us, not the things that we don't have to worry about," said state party Chairman Wayne Holland. "Our biggest concern is the very real danger of a Donald Trump presidency."

The Jackson rally comes amid a national push by Democrats to protest the increasingly divisive rhetoric of

The following is my first attempt to write an English translation of the phone conversation between Christopher Hitchens and the BBC's Jeremy Paxman in October 2005. I have endeavored to make the translation as close as possible to Hitchens' voice, and have also tried to be as fair and accurate as possible. I have also translated the questions and answers by treating them as quotations from the interview.

Q: I read that you are on the agenda of the Catholic Church Law Commission. I wonder if you might be able to tell us anything about that.

A: Well, I'm not in the law commission at all. I'm just a member of the House of Lords. But I am very much concerned about the way in which the Church is trying to deal with homosexuality. I think that they're utterly divorced from reality. They're utterly divorced from faith. And as a consequence of that, they're utterly divorced from what church teaching is about.

And the more that I think about it, the more I think that maybe the Church should get out of the business of telling people what they should believe and what they shouldn't believe. And I think that they should just do whatever the Bible says. And when they do that, I think that they're free to believe whatever they want.

I think the Church ought to follow the example of the Prophet Isaiah when he said, "Let there be no compulsion in religion." The Prophet said, "Let there be no coercion in religion," which meant that the Coptic Christians should not be prevented from leaving Egypt. And what the Pope is doing is exactly the same thing. He's picking up the sword of the Apostle Paul and using it against his own people. And it's absolutely wrong.

You know, I was a journalist for many years, and I was very much involved in what happened to the "Quakers." The Quakers, of course, are not a religious group. They're a pacifist group. They say, "We don't believe in violence." And they say, "We don't believe in war." And they believe that people are entitled to live their lives as they wish.

And the Church of England is trying to do the same thing. The Pope is doing the same thing. The Archbishop of Canterbury is doing the same thing. And they're all doing it by force.

And, of course, that's why I was so upset when I read about the Roma, because they are not a religious group. They're a race group. And they're being persecuted because they're a race group. And that is absolutely wrong.

Q: So what do you think of the Pope's recent decision to allow the Roman Catholic Church to adopt a more tolerant attitude toward homosexuality?

A: Well, I think the Pope is absolutely right to make this decision. I think that the Church has lost all credibility in the country. It has lost all credibility with the people. It has lost all credibility with the children. It has lost all credibility with the parents. Everybody has lost credibility with it.

The Church has lost all credibility with the people. It has lost all credibility with the children. It has lost all credibility with the parents. Everybody has lost credibility with it.

The fact is that the Church has lost its role as the guardian of morality. It has lost that role. I think that the Pope is absolutely right to do this. And I think that the Pope should make it very clear that he will not tolerate any attempt by any Church authority to interfere in the private lives of people.

Q: What do you think of the Catholic Church's ban on contraceptive devices?

A: Well, I think that it's a very dangerous thing. I think that it's a very dangerous thing. I think that it's a very dangerous thing for the Church. It's a very dangerous thing for the children. It's a very dangerous thing for the women who are not in the Church. And I think the Church should be very clear about the fact that it will not tolerate any attempts by the Church to interfere in the private lives of people.

Q: I read in this book that you are a member of the Catholic Church's group called Faith and Reason. How do you feel about that?

A: Well, I don't know whether he's a full member or not, but he does seem to be in the Faith and Reason group. I don't know if you're aware of it, but I'm one of the spokespeople. And I think you do have to be in the Faith and Reason group to be in the Faith and Reason group.

Q: So you're a member of Faith and Reason?

A: Yes, I am.

Q: How do you feel about the Church's stance on homosexuality?

A: Well, I think that it's completely out of touch with reality. I think that it's completely out of touch with faith

I'm not sure when I first heard about all the controversy surrounding the term "feminism," but I immediately became curious about the controversy. I had no idea how to go about learning more about the controversy. I'm, by nature, a pretty casual person. I find myself asking "Why?" over and over again. I wonder why I would be a feminist in the first place. I'm not unhappy with my life. I love my job, I love my body, and I love my friends. I don't have any grievances I can't easily address. In fact, I'm fairly content with the way I'm living my life. However, my life is still a constant exercise in self-doubt. Even though my life is great, I often feel like a "half-hearted feminist" — that is, someone who supports feminism but who doesn't identify as a feminist.

I've been feeling this way about feminism for a while and I'm not alone. In fact, according to a new survey, nearly 80 percent of women under 30 think of themselves as feminists. But while that may seem like good news, it's not. These women still think of themselves as men. They still see men as the default partners and see themselves as "the guy." They still see feminism as something that will benefit men only. They still think of feminism as a movement that will benefit men, not women. And they still think of feminism as something that would benefit men and not women.

This is one reason that so many women don't identify as feminists. I know that identifying as a feminist sounds good on the surface, but it's not. The term is simply not an accurate description of what feminism is. There is no "ism" word for the very real idea that, as a human being, you have the right to define your own priorities and pursue life as you see fit.

There is no "ism" word for the very real idea that, as a human being, you have the right to define your own priorities and pursue life as you see fit.

The same goes for men. There are no "isms" for the very real idea that men have the right to define their own priorities and pursue their own life span. We don't use the term "ism" to term "feminism." We use the term "male" to describe men. And there are no "isms" for the very real idea that men have the right to define their own priorities and pursue their own life span. We don't use the term "ism" to term "feminism." We use the term "male" to describe men. And there are no "isms" for the very real idea that men have the right to define their own priorities and pursue their own life span. We don't use the term "ism" to term "feminism." We use the term "male" to describe men.

I realize that this might not sit well with many of you. I realize that you might think that women merely have a "feminism" and that men have a "masculism." But this is not the case. Feminism is not a movement for women. Feminism is a movement for all human beings. It is a movement to demand that men and women be treated equally, that men and women be given the same opportunities to pursue and achieve their goals, and that men and women be held accountable to the same standards of conduct.

There is no "ism" word for the very real idea that men have the right to define their own priorities and pursue their own life span. We don't use the term "ism" to term "feminism." We use the term "male" to describe men.

Feminism is not a movement for women. Feminism is a movement for all human beings.

Now that that's out of the way, I'm going to discuss some of the biggest differences between feminism and the other "isms."

1. "I'm not a feminist, I'm just a humanist"

This phrase is the most common reason people get in trouble for not identifying as a feminist. This phrase is the most common reason people get in trouble for not identifying as a feminist.

Let's say a woman goes to a feminist conference. She sees a speaker who seems to have the same views as she does. She listens to the lecture, she sees a lot of women in the audience, and she thinks, "I'm a feminist! I'm just a humanist!"

The problem here is a common one. Humanists are all about equality. It is important for humanism to understand that most humanists are feminists. And it is important for humanism to know that most humanists have ideas about equality that are in the same vein as feminism.

If you were to ask most humanists why they are feminists, they would most likely tell you that they believe that women have

In 1994, Steven Spielberg's Jaws was the biggest movie of the year. It was a box office disaster, but it was one of the most popular movies of the generation. The movie had an awful lot of characters, themes, and plot twists, but it still came off as a pretty solid family movie. The success of Jaws led to a chain of sequels, a film series, a TV show, and a bunch of merchandising. Audiences and critics loved Jaws, and then they hated it. In 1995, the film was ranked as the most hated movie of all time by the American film website Rotten Tomatoes, which was a huge shock to Spielberg.

The following year, Jaws was again the most controversial movie of that year. The sequel, Jaws: The Revenge, was also a huge hit, but it was a much more popular movie. It was the most profitable film of the year, and led to a new franchise of sequels. Jaws 3: Back to the Bay was very well received, and was a huge financial success. Jaws 4: The Revenge of Jack Reacher proved to be another financial success, and it spawned sequels, spin-offs, and more merchandising. Jaws 5 was incredibly popular, and it even led to a reboot of the franchise.

But one of the biggest films of that year was a special occasion release, Jaws: The Hunt for Red October. It was a very popular movie, but it was a surprise hit. It was the first film to be rated R, and it was the highest grossing film of the year. It was also the highest grossing film of the summer, and it was the third highest grossing film of the summer of 1995. It was the highest grossing film of the year in every country where it was released. The film was a huge success, but it was also a box office disaster, and it was one of the most unpopular movies of the year.

The movie was certainly a hit on home video, and it helped to launch the home video boom. The movie's success made its sequel, Jaws: The Revenge of Jaws, a success, and it made me want to see it.

The film is back in theaters for a limited release this weekend, and it's a good time to be watching it. Jaws: The Hunt for Red October is set to open wide over the weekend, and I'm hoping the film will be a hit. It's a fun movie to watch, and it has some great characters, themes, and plot twists. I'm also hoping that it will help to revitalize the box office in the wake of Jaws 3: Back to the Bay.

The movie features a lot of characters from the previous films. It has a lot of returning characters, like Richard Dreyfuss, Peter Falk, and Richard Dreyfuss. It also has a lot of new characters, like Jack Reacher, Marla Singer, and Captain Phillips. It also has a lot of new themes, like how the world is changing and how the government continues to hold back the natural world.

I've been watching the movie, and I've been talking about it with my friends. It's been a lot of fun, and I think it's going to be a big hit. It's a movie that I'm looking forward to watching, and I'm also looking forward to seeing how the film's critics will respond to it.

Here are my thoughts on Jaws: The Hunt for Red October.

The Plot

The movie starts off with the following plot synopsis:

Jaws: The Hunt for Red October follows the exploits of a Navy SEAL Team called the Strike Force. During the night, the Strike Force faces a fierce and unexpected enemy in the form of a giant shark that attacks on the night of the Red October holiday. The Strike Force must fight back in order to save the day, but in doing so they are forced to confront the might of the shark, which is much larger than anything that the teams have ever faced.

The movie then follows the Strike Force as they attempt to get their mission accomplished, and on the way they discover that they are not alone in the world. The movie also follows the Strike Force as they fight to save the day in the midst of a lot of controversy.

There are a lot of characters in Jaws: The Hunt for Red October. It has plenty of villains, and plenty of heroes. I'm not going to spoil which characters are in the movie, because there are a lot of characters.

Of the people I've seen in the movie, I like the following characters. Jaws is a cool character. He's smart, he's tough, he's smart, he's tough, and he's smart.

"I will not allow the government to shut down," he said in a statement. "I will not negotiate over the debt limit."

Boehner's statement came shortly after a $16 trillion debt ceiling was reached.

"To get to yes, we need the president to lower our borrowing limit and the Senate to find a way to fund the government," Boehner said. "I will not negotiate over the debt limit, and I will not allow another government shutdown."

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told his Democratic caucus that he would negotiate over the debt ceiling if the House would agree to halt funding for Obamacare.

"If the House will not act, then the Senate will," Reid said.

"If the Senate will not act, we will move forward with the debt ceiling vote next week," he said.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters that he does not "see anything that would compel us to go to the brink."

Boehner said the House would hold a vote on the debt ceiling next week, after which he would determine whether to accept the Senate's plan to allow Obamacare to continue paying its subsidies.

"We'll see what happens next," he said.

The House passed the measure with enough Republicans voting "aye" to pass it. The Senate approved the bill with 60 votes, and it will be sent to Obama to sign.

In a statement, the White House said President Obama "will not negotiate over the full faith and credit of the United States of America" and will veto any measure that fails to avoid default.

The president is expected to sign a bill that would allow the Treasury Department to borrow up to $1.2 trillion if the debt ceiling is not raised.

"The House will have ample opportunity to catch up with the Senate in order to pass a clean short-term extension of the debt ceiling," Boehner said. "The House has already passed a clean short-term extension, and our Democratic colleagues made that clear. If they want to continue to fund these government operations through the end of the month, they should do so by passing a clean CR."

Boehner also said the House would not raise the debt ceiling without a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.

"I will not accept any plan that defunds Obamacare or delays the employer mandate," he said. "The president is wrong and his party should be ashamed of their actions."

McConnell said he would hold a vote on the debt ceiling next week, after which he would determine whether to accept the Senate's plan to allow Obamacare to continue paying its subsidies.

"I will give the Senate the chance to do the right thing and vote for a clean CR that increases the debt limit and sticks to our promise to repeal and replace Obamacare," McConnell said. "If the Senate does not act, we will work with the House to ensure that the government is funded and the American people get relief from Obamacare."

The Canadian dollar is currently trading at $0.724, up from $0.719 on the day before the announcement.

Mr. Thibeault said Thursday the new tax on large financial institutions will help reduce the country's trade and economic imbalances.

"Our approach is not to simply try and balance the budget and we will make some adjustments to that," he said. "We will do it in a way that is fair, that is reasonable and that is respectful to the middle class.

"Over the longer term, I'm not convinced that the way we're going to do it would be the right way. The way we're going to do it is to offer tax relief to the middle class and I'm not convinced that's the right way to do it."

Mr. Thibeault said there was no reason to believe the tax would lead to a sudden tightening of financial markets.

"I think what's important is that we have stimulus to stimulate the economy and we have a process in place to collect the revenues and to use the money to stimulate the economy. And that's what we're going to do."

Mr. Thibeault's announcement comes as the Bank of Canada is poised to announce a new round of interest rate cuts later this month that will likely include an interest rate cut for the first time in six years.

In the past, the bank has said that rate cuts are in part a result of a weak economy, but Mr. Thibeault said Thursday he was concerned about a lack of confidence in Canada's financial system.

"I think the biggest factor is confidence in the financial system in Canada and in the world," he said. "We've got a lot of work to do to build confidence in the financial system."

Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney has said the country's economy has begun to recover but that it remains weak.

"We are on the cusp of a sustained recovery and the Bank of Canada, as we've said before, is concerned about the lack of progress in the recovery," he said in a speech to the Canadian Club of Toronto on Monday.

Mr. Thibeault said he expects the Bank of Canada to reduce its benchmark interest rate to between 0.50 and 0.75 per cent by the end of 2015.

The Bank of Canada said the economy is expected to grow by 1.8 per cent in the first quarter.

On Wednesday, the central bank moved a quarter percentage point to 0.5 per cent from 0.75 per cent, and said it expected the economy to grow by 2.1 per cent in the second quarter.

The bank lowered its growth forecast for the third quarter of the year as well. It now expects the economy to grow by 2.1 per cent in the third quarter, compared with a previous estimate of 2.7 per cent.

Under the banner of "Stop Koch PAC," the group is targeting Democrat and Republican state legislators with a series of town hall events that are being held in locations that are either very close to the offices of a state legislator or very close to their district's district office.

The first of the events, scheduled for September 21st, will be held at the University of Dayton.

According to the New York Times, the Koch-funded group is spending more than $100 million over the next two years to elect members of Congress who will vote to advance the interests of the Koch brothers.

The New York Times reports on the heart of the issue:

The premise of the Stop Koch PAC is that voters are being let down by politicians who are unwilling to stand up to the billionaire industrialists, who bankroll the Republican Party and have become a central force in the national political debate.

On Sunday, a team of scientists from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) announced that 2017 was the hottest year on record, and that global temperatures rose 0.64 degrees Celsius since the start of the 20th century.

The news was met with a swift and unusual backlash from people who claim to be scientists, and who first started making this claim a few years ago.

The backlash, which has been called the "climate denier's equivalent of the Boston Tea Party," was sparked by a series of tweets from the UNEP's top official, Erik Solheim, who posted a photo of a paper with the title "Global temperature increase from 1951–2010."

This paper claims to show that globally, 2015 was the hottest year on record.

That's it. It's not even a paper. It's a slide show. The data is of the usual type, and the author is a UNEP employee. The chart is the same as all the other ones, and is used by climate scientists all the time to show how much the temperature of the Earth has changed over time.

To most people, this looks like solid evidence that the Earth is getting hotter. But for climate change deniers, it's just another example of "climate change" being used to push a political agenda.

"The paper is a forgery," tweeted Nobel Laureate physicist Richard Feynman. "It says the warming from 1951 – 2010 was 0.6C. Not 1.0C."

The paper says the warming from 1951 – 2010 was 0.6C. Not 1.0C. https://t.co/c0W2XvYA5b — Richard Feynman (@Richard_Feynman) November 27, 2017

J. Scott Armstrong, a climate economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, was more direct:

It's a well-known fact that the world's climate has warmed for decades due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions. It's also well-known that climate scientists don't actually have the data to back up these claims. However, people with an agenda will always find a way to distort the truth.

The same is true for the UNEP report, according to journalist Chris Mooney's new book, The Republican War on Science.

"UNEP, of all places, gets to write the climate report in a country where most people don't believe in climate change," Mooney tells The Daily Caller News Foundation. "That makes it all the more surprising that it comes out with such a foolish report."

"This isn't for news consumption. This is for propaganda," he continues. "The purpose is to get people to think the planet is getting hotter. If you think the planet is getting hotter, you think you can kind of change that."

The climate deniers are convinced that the UNEP report contains enough facts to support their worldview. But Mooney says that data is ambiguous and is often not analyzed in a very detailed way.

The UNEP report is "muddled" and includes "a lot of stuff that's not true," Mooney says. "They're not making the connection that the planet is warming. This is a document that's intended to be used for political purposes. And the scientists who created it didn't think through how to present the data in a way that makes sense to certain people."

The UNEP report comes just as President Donald Trump is unveiling his own climate change plan. At a press conference Wednesday, Trump said he plans to "cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to UN global warming programs."

"It's just like the tobacco industry," Mooney says. "They wouldn't have done that in the 90s. They were trying to stop smoking. They didn't want to admit that smoking was bad. But they knew it was bad. And they had a scientific basis to say that smoking is bad."

"The truth is, the UNEP report is just a good example of how climate science is a political tool," Mooney says. "It's a way to get people to think that climate change is happening because something else is going on. It's all a b.s. scheme."

The UNEP report "has no point," Mooney says. "This is a report that's supposed to be used for policy purposes, and it's not. It's a document that's supposed to be used to convince people to invest in infrastructure, and it's not. It's a document that's supposed to be used to convince the public that we need to do something about climate change, and it's not."

This isn't the first time scientists have been accused of manipulating the facts to push a political agenda. In 2014, a group of researchers led by one of the world's most prominent climate scientists, James Hansen, and published an article in the journal Science claiming that 2015 was

"The whole idea that the bourgeoisie considers itself to be the ruling class of society, and that by its mere existence it constitutes the ruling power, is a fiction; in no country has the bourgeoisie ever been the ruling class of society; the conditions under which it has acted as such, have always been produced by the action of other classes, by other economic conditions.

"The ruling ideas of each epoch are the ideas of its ruling class. What the ruling ideas of any epoch are, is a function of the economic conditions under which those ideas are diffused.

This is the third part of the article on how to set up a distributed system in the cloud, and in this article we will set up a shared queue, which will be a part of our distributed system.

Let's say we want to implement a system with a queue, a scheduler and a client. In this article we will assume we have a distributed system with a queue and a scheduler with some clients.

The clients will be able to communicate with the queue and the scheduler, so we can implement a queue model.

In the previous articles we have assumed that we have a distributed system between two machines, and that the servers are running on the same machine. Today we are going to change this assumption and assume that the distributed system is running on two different machines. The idea behind this is to keep the cost of the nodes in a reasonable range, to avoid the performance issues of having two run nodes on the same machine.

I hope that you will find this article useful.

The system will consist of two main parts, namely the queue and the scheduler. The queue will be implemented using an EventMachine, the scheduler will be implemented using a Storm (or any other event-based architecture) and the client side will be implemented using RxJava.

The following is an example of a single queue, which can be used as a client, and the single queue is used as a queue using a Scheduler.

Scheduler

The scheduler is the part of the system which will listen to events coming from the queue. It will be able to determine the next event to run and how to run it.

We are going to use a simple pseudo-event-based based system. The scheduler will listen to one message at a time. The message will be an event, a type of event will be persistent which means that it will not be managed by the scheduler.

The message will contain a value which we will call the "queueId". The queueId will be used by the scheduler to determine what kind of event we should run next.

On the client side the scheduler will process the message by either doing a broadcast or an onNext callback. It will be able to decide which one to use based on the messageId.

The message will contain a value which we will call the "queue" which will be the queue on which the message was broadcast.

On the onNext callback, the queue will be updated by the messageId.

To make things easier for our scheduler, we will not create a new message, but only subscribe to the messageId.

Let's start by creating the scheduler.

In this part we will only need a single static class which will hold our scheduler.

public static class Scheduler { public static Scheduler scheduler; }

The static scheduler will be used by the queue and the scheduler, the values of the variables in the scheduler class will be used by the queue and the scheduler, so we don't need to change them, however, we can update them if we want to rewrite the scheduler.

The scheduler will just receive messages from the queue and it will be able to decide how to run them.

Let's start by creating a single static class which will hold our scheduler.

public static class Scheduler { public static Scheduler scheduler; static Scheduler scheduler = new Scheduler(); }

The static class is used by the scheduler, but we will be using the static class of the queue instead.

public class Queue { private static final String ACTION_ADD = "add"; private static final String ACTION_COPY = "copy"; private static final String ACTION_DELETE = "delete"; private static final String ACTION_SET = "set"; private static final String ACTION_SHIFT = "shift"; private static final String ACTION_UNSHIFT = "unshift"; private static final String ACTION_INSERT = "insert"; private static final String ACTION_REMOVE = "remove"; private static final String ACTION_TOGGLE = "toggle"; private static final String ACTION_BIND = "bind"; private static final String ACTION_REMOVE = "remove"; private static final String ACTION_SETBIND = "setbind"; private static final String ACTION_REMOVEBIND = "removebind"; private static final String ACTION_CREATE = "create"; private static final String ACTION_DELETEBIND = "deletebind"; private static final String ACTION_CREATEBIND = "createbind"; ... }

The Queue class will hold our queue.

public class Queue { private static final String ACTION_ADD = "add"; private static final String ACTION_COPY = "copy"; private static final String ACTION_DELETE = "delete";

A couple of days ago I posted a photo of a woman walking down a street in Thailand. The picture was taken by a British tourist named Rebecca Wilson, and it shows a woman in a traditional Thai dress and headscarf with her head hanging low—a look that was at once unremarkable and deeply offensive to many Thais. The picture went viral and spread like wildfire, and Wilson's French boyfriend, who was one of the thousands of people who shared the image on Facebook, was forced to apologize to the people of Thailand. He also made it known that he was considering suing Facebook.

I write to you now to take action.

Rebecca Wilson was in Thailand to do some sightseeing, and to meet some Thai friends. She was on her way back to the hotel from the beach when she passed a group of men on the street. She raised her eyebrow and smiled. "They're staring at my head," she said. "Look at their sunglasses."

She looked down and saw that the two men were wearing shades. Then she looked up and saw that their sunglasses were made of elephant dung.

Thai women are not supposed to wear sunglasses in public—as a matter of fact, wearing sunglasses in public is often considered the height of immodesty in this country. In fact, it is a crime to wear sunglasses in public or even to look at the sun while the sun is shining. This is true even in places like France and Germany, which are not exactly known for their intolerance of anything that might be considered immodest. But in Thailand, it is a common sight to see women in street clothes and some sort of a headscarf. It is usually a sari.

Rebecca was not wearing a sari, but she was still shocked. She looked at her boyfriend, who was just as shocked. They looked at the man who had called her a "cunt" and a "whore." They looked at him and then at the sunglasses. They turned back to the men and told them that it was not okay to stare at a woman's head and that they should go away.

They did not. They found their sunglasses and went back to their hotel.

Photo by Rebecca Wilson

The other men were not driven away by the women's actions—they continued to stare at them. In fact, they continued to do it for a while. Rebecca and her boyfriend called the police, who took the men's sunglasses away. They did not call the police because they were not sure what exactly the law was in Thailand about this. They just did it because they had to.

So here I am, a foreigner in Thailand, trying to act like a Thai. I wear a sari that is not traditional, which is the reason that women in Thailand are sometimes called "whores." I wear sunglasses that are not traditional, but I do not feel the need to cover my eyes. I don't even wear a headscarf, because I have been told that I should not.

This is not a story about cultural differences. This is a story about the law.

In Thailand, the law says that women should not wear anything that can be mistaken for a headscarf.

Shoes, scarves, and headbands are specifically mentioned in the law. The Thai word for headscarf is "kasih." So you can see why Rebecca's boyfriend, who is a tourist from France, was confused. He had no idea what her point was.

The U.S. State Department has a page on "Headcovering in Public" that explains that a headscarf is not a mandatory requirement in Thailand. But it also says that "head coverings are not a legal requirement for women in Thailand."

So what is the legal requirement? What is the actual law?

The law is as follows: "No person shall wear a head covering in public without the consent of the proprietor."

The first thing to note is that this is not a law against the wearing of headscarves. The law only prohibits the wearing of headscarves in a public place. So the law does not prohibit women from wearing traditional Thai headscarves in public that does not contain the words "kasih."

So how does the law work? According to the government website of the Department of Special Investigations, "In Thailand, wearing a head covering is not a legal requirement for women. However, wearing a head covering will be considered as an infringement of the Law on Public Order."

Again, this is not a law against headscarves. This is a law against wearing headscarves in a public place.

So what is the penalty?

According to the Bangkok Post, "The head coverings can be fined from Bt5,000 to Bt10,000. But if the violation is repeated,

A new study in the journal Science Translational Medicine finds that smoking marijuana can make people lose weight and slow their metabolic rate. The study by researchers from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Texas, used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to examine the relationship between marijuana use, weight and metabolic rate in a sample of 1,384 adults who had been healthy for at least one year.

The study found that current marijuana users lost an average of 1.8 pounds (0.8 kilograms) between the time of their last marijuana use and the time of their survey. Former users gained a total of 3.9 pounds (1.5 kilograms) in that time frame, while current users gained an additional 3.6 pounds (1.2 kilograms) in the 12 months after their last use.

"We were interested in understanding the mechanisms that might account for the weight loss and metabolic slowing observed in marijuana users, and we found that they appeared to be caused by a decline in appetite," said lead author Dr. Jodi Gilman, Associate Professor of Medicine at NIDA. The study was supported by NIDA's Intramural Research Program, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Science Foundation.

Gilman added that the findings are consistent with previous research that suggests that smoking marijuana may cause changes in brain activity associated with the regulation of appetite, the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine, and changes in the activity of other hormones such as leptin.

"We also found that this weight loss and metabolic slowing was associated with a lower level of activity in the regions of the brain related to appetite regulation and regulation of energy balance," said Gilman. "This suggests that marijuana may help people lose weight by affecting the appetite system, and perhaps by decreasing the activity of this brain system. We also found that this trend was independent of other factors that are associated with weight gain, such as smoking and physical activity."

Researchers also found that marijuana use was associated with a decrease in the activity in several brain regions that are associated with appetite regulation, such as the cingulate cortex, the insula, the hypothalamus, and the striatum.

"We found that the marijuana users' weight loss was associated with a decrease in activity in these brain regions, which suggests that marijuana may be a promising new treatment to help people lose weight," said Gilman.

The study was supported by NIDA and the National Institutes of Health, grant numbers 1R01DA013514, 1R01DA013673, 1R01DA013775, 1R03DA012075, 1R04DA016024, a Florida.00-DE-5136 grant from NIDA, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

The study was published online May 26, 2015, in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

It's a satire of the United States, written by one of the most famous writers of the 19th century. It was published in 1885, and was his last book.

In 1895, the book was made into a motion picture in the United States. The movie was called The Tramp.

Contents show]

Summary Edit

The book begins with a United States citizen arriving in the USA and asking for asylum. The man is asked if he can be of help to the country by a man who claims to be a representative of the government. When the man denies any kind of help, the man is told that in order to be granted asylum, he must have a "stupid name", and that his name is "The Stupidest Man in America".

The American tries to convince the representative that he is not a stupid man, but he is told that he is a stupid man. The American is then told that he must be sent to the country's capital in Washington, DC, to become a citizen of the country. The American then asks if he will be sent to the prison in New York, New York. The American is told that he must be sent to the prison in New York, New York.

In the book, as in the movie, the American is a slave. He is a "stupid man" who only wants to know about the United States. He is unable to understand the country's political system, its economy, or its culture. He is particularly angered by the fact that his friend is a "stupid man" who is a "stupid man" who has a "stupid name" and is a "stupid man".

The American is then given a passport, and is taken

(CNN) In a small room behind a log cabin in Vermont, the first of two female astronauts has been trained for her first space walk.

They will join the three men who have traveled into space on the International Space Station, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The astronauts are NASA's Kate Rubins; Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka; and Canada's Chris Hadfield. Hadfield will be the first Canadian in space.

Rubins, 44, and Padalka, 40, have been training together for the past two days.

Rubins, a veteran of a dozen space shuttle missions, is the first female astronaut to fly into space.

"This is a really big deal," she said. "It's really cool to be part of this group that's going to go to space."

In her first space walk, Rubins would have to wear a space suit with a glove.

"It's a great feeling," she said. "I'm pretty excited."

The two women are also learning how to perform space walks in weightlessness, something the men have done many times in the past.

"It is very different from what we're used to," Padalka said. "I'm ready to try it and jump in the deep end."

Rubins was born in Russia and moved to the United States with her family when she was 7. Her father, a physicist, and mother, a teacher, taught her all about space.

"I was like, 'I'm going to go in space someday, but I don't know when,'" she said.

After graduating from high school, Rubins enrolled in the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to study astrophysics. She became a NASA astronaut in 1999.

"That's when I started thinking about what it would be like to go into space," she said.

Rubins has flown on four shuttle missions, including to the Hubble Space Telescope in 2001.

She was the astronaut who helped put Hubble in orbit in December 2009, and was the first woman to command the space station.

She also has flown on the Space Shuttle Discovery, and again in 2012.

"I'm not planning on doing any of those things again," she said. "I'm not going to be going in for orbit, or doing science experiments."

The first woman to reach space was Sally Ride, who flew on the last shuttle flight in 1983.

"It was a big deal," Ride said. "We were all very happy to have her."

To be part of history is amazing, but it's not all about the space, Rubins said.

"It's about how much fun it is to do it, and how much we enjoy ourselves on the ground before and after," she said. "It's about how much we love what we do."

The two astronauts will be joined on the Soyuz capsule by Hadfield, who is a Canadian aerospace engineer who has designed and launched satellites into space.

Hadfield has been a celebrity since he completed the first solo flight of the space station in 2001.

"It's overwhelming, this whole thing," he said.

He will be joined by a fellow Canadian, Chris Hadfield, who will be the first Canadian in space.

"It's just a big deal," he said. "I'm excited to be here."

Rubins said she felt a sense of responsibility when she was asked to join the space walk.

"I definitely feel like I'm part of history," she said. "It's quite an honor."<|endoftext|>"If it takes a woman to make a man feel a little bit uncomfortable, then it's worth it."

For the past ten months I have been working on a project to explore the relationship between artists and their audiences. For the most part, I have been fascinated with the topic, wondering why we are drawn to these seemingly unconnected individuals and their senses of self-expression. What does it feel like to be in someone else's skin? It is a question I have been asking a lot lately.

In the past year alone, I have had the great fortune to meet, work with, and work with the likes of

Kanye West

The Weeknd

Michael Jackson

Justin Bieber

Lucy Hale

Eminem

And of course, my own dad.

In addition to having these conversations, I have also had the luck of witnessing the growth of these artists, myself, and the art community at large. Through these interactions, I have also learned a great deal about the power of art and the way we view ourselves, our world, and who we are as a society.

A red-shirted Jarryd Hayne could be a top-five pick in next month's NRL draft.

The 23-year-old, who was forced off the field in last night's 21-10 win over the Bulldogs with a hamstring injury, is in good form and has a chance to impress a select few clubs at the draft combine in Canberra.

If he is selected, Hayne will be the first Australian to be drafted in the top five since Chris Sandow in 1990.

"I'm sure there are a few teams who will want to see me play in 2017," Hayne said last night.

"It's just about doing what I love — which is playing rugby league."

Hayne said it was his goal to remain in the NRL.

"If I can play rugby league and keep playing, there is nothing better," he said.

"I've been playing rugby league for the last four years and to play in the NRL and be a part of the New York team is the greatest feeling in the world.

"It's the best thing that could happen to me in my life."

The NRL has confirmed that the NSW Origin side will be announced in early January.

The digital currency has now soared to a high of $10,895.37 per unit, according to exchange data service Coindesk.

Bitcoin hit a high of $3,728.86 on Nov. 21. It has since fallen to just below $2,500.

The surge in the price of Bitcoin has been driven by speculation that China could remove the remaining restrictions on offshore trading of the cryptocurrency.

The latest price surge follows a surge over the weekend, when the currency shot up to a record high of $1,895.36 per unit.

Earlier this month, Bitcoin crashed by $300 in less than a day, plummeting to $1,000.

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency. It allows users to send money and make purchases without the need to go through a financial institution, and, in theory, can be cheaper for consumers than traditional forms of money.

But Bitcoin has been plagued by speculation that it may be subject to further restrictions in China as a result of its popularity among tech-savvy Chinese citizens.

Last week, the country's financial regulator said it would be investigating Bitcoin-related companies for possible violations of the country's anti-money laundering laws.

The decision comes as the Chinese government has imposed tighter restrictions on the use of virtual currency, as the government attempts to rein in capital outflows.

China has banned ICOs, or initial coin offerings, which offer investors the chance to buy digital tokens in exchange for real-world currency.<|endoftext|>Mozilla has announced that they will be releasing Firefox 50.0 on April 1st, and this will be the final version of Firefox for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Celiac disease is a lifelong autoimmune disease that destroys the lining of the small intestine and leads to intestinal damage and digestive problems such as diarrhea and constipation. It is the most common autoimmune disorder in the Western world.

In the United States, celiac disease is estimated to affect about 10 percent of the population.

Celiac disease is a serious disease that requires a healthy immune system. It's also important to know that gluten sensitivity is a common medical condition that's not associated with celiac disease. And, when you do have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, you should be sure to minimize your exposure to gluten so you don't develop an autoimmune disorder or gluten sensitivity.

What is celiac disease?

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that destroys the lining of the small intestine. It isn't caused by a single food or food ingredient. Pathogens like viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi are the most common causes of celiac disease.

Symptoms of celiac disease

Celiac disease results in:

Inflammation of the small intestine. Inflammation of the small intestine leads to damage and damage to the villi, the tiny folds of tissue that line the small intestine. This damage and damage to the villi leads to the intestinal damage and inflammation found in celiac disease.

Inflammation of the small intestine leads to damage and damage to the villi, the tiny folds of tissue that line the small intestine. This damage and damage to the villi leads to the intestinal damage and inflammation found in celiac disease. Constipation and diarrhea. When the intestine is damaged, it can't absorb nutrients. When you don't absorb nutrients, you can't poop. This leads to diarrhea and constipation.

When the intestine is damaged, it can't absorb nutrients. When you don't absorb nutrients, you can't poop. This leads to diarrhea and constipation. Weight loss. Celiac disease also causes weight loss. This is usually because the immune system attacks the small intestine and its contents, causing the villi to shrink and the villi to become smaller.

Celiac disease also causes weight loss. This is usually because the immune system attacks the small intestine and its contents, causing the villi to shrink and the villi to become smaller. Difficulty gaining weight. Most people with celiac disease have a hard time gaining weight because they have a hard time absorbing nutrients.

Why do people get celiac disease?

Celiac disease is a genetic disease. It isn't caused by a single food or food ingredient.

People with celiac disease may have:

Tissue damage to their small intestine. The small intestine is the first part of the digestive tract that comes into contact with food. It's called the duodenum because it's the first part of the small intestine.

Tasmanian government officials have been told to expect a rise in the cost of electricity in the next few years as the state moves to shift towards an electricity-to-gas mix, according to the state's dominant utility.

Energy Minister Matthew Groom said consumers would feel the impact of the move within the next three to five years.

"By 2020, we expect to see a substantial increase in the price of electricity," he said.

"We have a target to have a 50 per cent renewable energy mix by 2030.

"We're going to see a big increase in costs from that target."

Mr Groom said the state had already begun investing in its solar energy resources.

"By 2020, we could be up to 20 per cent renewable energy as a state," he said.

Tasmania's power mix is largely based around hydro-electricity, with 32 per cent of the state's electricity coming from coal-fired generators.

The state has long been concerned about the impact of climate change on energy security, with many homes and businesses already running on supplies from wind and solar power.

The state's dominant electricity retailer, Powerlink, has already held talks with the federal government over the future of the state's energy mix.

Its chief executive, Peter Thomas, said the state would need to introduce a mix of varying power sources to ensure reliability.

"There's a lot of interest in renewable energy. The issue is whether that can be delivered in the time frame that we need to deal with the transition, which is probably longer than the timeframe that [former Liberal leader] Tony Abbott had in mind," he said.

"How do we get it through the Senate, rather than through an extension of the carbon tax?

"How do we get it through the Senate, rather than through a carbon tax extension? That's a significant issue.

"So the reality is that we're going to need a mix of different technologies, and this has been a conversation we've had with the federal government.

Just as there are many ways to get paid for being born male or female, there are many ways to get paid for being an American. The truth is, no matter what you do, you'll get paid.

That's not to say that you'll have a zero payoff. You might not even make money after you leave your job. You'll probably spend a lot of time working. You'll probably have to work hard to be able to pay the bills. But ultimately, you'll get paid for what you do, and there are a lot of ways to get paid for your work, no matter what your job is.

It's worth looking at the pay rates of the jobs that pay the most, because the jobs that pay the most are often the ones that pay you the least.

The Obama administration said its decision was in order to avoid having the White House and its reporters "provide a platform for misinformation and conspiracy theories."

Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said Fox's programming "provides a platform for the alt-right and white supremacists and neo-Nazis."

In a letter to White House counsel Neil Eggleston, King accused the administration of "effectively silencing" Fox News Channel for its "grievance."

"Your letter states in no uncertain terms that the Office of White House Counsel will not allow Fox News to participate in any White House Press Briefing," King wrote. "I cannot fathom how this can be in the best interest of the American people or the press corps to allow Fox News to 'provide a platform for the alt-right, white supremacists and neo-Nazis.'"

The letter was sent on behalf of Fox News anchor Bret Baier, who was scheduled to be the White House's chief spokesman.

Eggleston responded to King's letter Friday, responding that the press corps should be given equal access to the president and his staff.

"I have advised you that the White House does not and will not provide a platform for commentary or partisan political activities that seek to undermine the work of our duly elected representative government," Eggleston wrote. "Mr. King's letter instead seeks to make the White House into a partisan battleground on the eve of the 2014 midterm elections. This is not a viable option for the White House."

The letter was signed by White House counsel

The UN General Assembly has voted to condemn North Korea for human rights abuses, including a "systematic and widespread" system of enforced disappearances. The resolution was passed by a vote of 138 in favour to seven against.

After the vote, US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said the vote represented a "turning point in the international community's collective response" to North Korea's human rights record.

"Human rights abuses in North Korea have been atrocious for decades, and the world has been waiting for the UN to act," she said in a statement.

North Korea has taken many steps to improve the human rights situation in recent years.

But Pyongyang's critics say the country still fails to protect citizens' rights and that it still abuses its citizens.

The report, which lists more than 20 human rights abuses North Korea has committed and that it is still committing, was commissioned by the UN Commission of Inquiry on North Korea, which investigates human rights issues.

By the end of 2016, it said the country had executed more than 100 people, including at least 50 by public beheadings.

A report last year by the UN Committee Against Torture also found there was a "systematic and widespread" use of torture and other ill-treatment by the authorities.

North Korea 'still in violation of human rights'

The resolution urges the UN Security Council to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court, to "prevent and punish" such crimes and to impose a travel ban and asset freeze on the country's leadership and officials.

It also calls for a "thorough and independent" investigation into the alleged use of chemical weapons and biological weapons.

It also calls on member states to "use all diplomatic and other means" to persuade North Korea to comply with its obligations.

The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women welcomed the resolution "in the strongest terms", saying it would send a "powerful message" to North Korea.

"The committee calls on all states and international organisations to take urgent measures to protect women and girls from violence and discrimination, including sexual violence, including in North Korea," the committee said in a statement.

The resolution also calls for the UN Human Rights Council to set up a special committee to investigate human rights abuses in North Korea.

The resolution, which was endorsed by the European Union, the US and Japan, is not legally binding, but it could serve as a powerful catalyst for international action.

UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein has previously warned that North Korea's human rights record "is still in violation of the international human rights obligations".

"The UN General Assembly has now taken an important step in setting the stage for the UN Human Rights Council to take this issue forward and I hope that the Human Rights Council will now take this opportunity to adopt a resolution on the human rights situation in North Korea," he said in a statement.

The council is expected to take action on North Korea by the end of the year.

The United Nations' top human rights body has a number of resolutions on the country, including one that condemned the country's human rights record in February.

The UN Commission of Inquiry on North Korea has been investigating human rights issues in the isolated country since April last year.<|endoftext|>The U.S. Navy has a growing problem: It has the oldest, smallest and most under-powered aircraft carrier in the world.

The USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's newest aircraft carrier, is less than two years old and lacks the necessary firepower to keep up with its planned deployment schedule, a top Navy official told Congress on Thursday.

"Based on the status of the ship, the carrier force is not capable of meeting planned deployments," Rear Adm. John Kirby, director of the Pentagon's Joint Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee.

Kirby said the Navy has only two carrier groups — the USS Abraham Lincoln and the USS George Washington — that can deploy at any given time.

"We have to maintain that force for the next 20 years, and I don't know if we can do that with one carrier group," Kirby said. "Unless we're going to create a different carrier group to support that, we're not going to get the results we want."

The Navy currently has 53 carrier groups in service, with about a dozen more in the planning stages, according to the Congressional Research Service.

The Navy's top officer said the Navy will have to decide by year's end whether to retire the carrier-based aircraft the Gerald R. Ford is designed to replace.

Kirby said the carrier fleet currently has two aircraft carriers — the USS Reagan and the USS George H.W. Bush — that are structurally sound and can transport aircraft.

"If we decide that we can't fly our aircraft carriers with a four-engine aircraft carrier ... we're going

"A hero who saves a girl's life and then dies in the attempt, who lives in a world where the laws of nature are suspended and the bad guys don't take any notice of the hero's actions, is... always a hero, right?"

This is a short story that I wrote almost a year ago, and it has been sitting in my drafts folder for years. It was originally meant for a forum post, but it didn't make the cut with the other stories. I decided to share it here as a reward for those willing to read it.

It is a story about a young man, Ben, who is a hero. You see, Ben is cursed with the knowledge of being an immortal being, and he is constantly haunted by his past. He has lived his entire life where every bad memory that he can remember is brought to the surface, and he wakes up every morning with a fresh headache, aching eyes, and a cold sweat. He is always able to do something about it, but he's not sure why; maybe it's his curse, or maybe it's his destiny.

He became a hero in order to escape his past, but that's not the only reason he is a hero. Ben is also a passionate man, and his desire to protect and save people, keeps him going in the face of all odds.

I hope you enjoy reading this short story as much as I enjoyed writing it.

The group took the unusual step of posting a letter on the website of its Ottawa office, urging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to support a project to capture methane from the oil and gas industry, which could help cut Canada's greenhouse gas emissions.

The letter states: "The oil and gas industry is responsible for an estimated 30 per cent of Canada's total greenhouse gas emissions. The industry's contribution to climate change is especially disturbing given the significant contribution that natural gas makes to Canada's economy, with the potential to reduce the industry's greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80 per cent by 2050."

Story continues below advertisement

The letter was signed by the environmental groups Environment Canada and the National Observer.

"We are asking the Prime Minister to take action in support of Canada's oil and gas industry by supporting the development of methane capture and storage technology," the letter states.

"This technology is already being used in the United States and is being considered as a viable solution to the controversial issue of fracking," the letter continues.

The letter further states that methane is a "potential solution" to climate change while also addressing the concerns of First Nations, farmers and the business community.

The letter, however, also raises questions about the cost of the technology, which is almost exclusively used in the United States.

"The technology has been demonstrated to capture methane, but it is costly to build and operate. To date, methane capture and storage technology has not been commercially developed in Canada," the letter states.

Methane is a greenhouse gas that has approximately 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide when it comes to forcing atmospheric temperature rise, the letter states.

The Association of Canadian Oil Sands Producers has said that the technology has been "proven, proven successful."

The Council of Canadians is part of a coalition of environmental and public interest groups that have been pressuring the Trudeau government to impose limits on greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas sector.

The organization's letter comes as the federal government is still deciding what measures to impose on the oil and gas industry in response to the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The Conservatives have been pushing for a national carbon price to pay for a variety of environmental initiatives, but the Liberals have said they want to wait until the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) puts in place a mechanism to pay for such measures.

The Trudeau government has said its priority is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.

Canada has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.

The NDP also promised in its platform to reduce emissions.

The group's letter comes ahead of a meeting in Vancouver this week between Environment Minister Catherine McKenna and the CEOs of the world's largest oil and gas companies.

Ms. McKenna is expected to meet with the heads of Shell, Chevron, BP and ConocoPhillips on Tuesday.<|endoftext|>Rape of an Indian woman by three men in a moving bus in Gurgaon, a city in Haryana, India, has shocked the country.

The man who shot to infamy in the Scottish independence debate this week is the son of a senior care home manager who was forced to close over a staffing shortage.

Peter Doherty, 49, is the leader of the independence campaign and was the focus of the 23 July referendum debate.

He is a former chairman of the Scottish Socialist Party and co-founded the party in 1991.

He has also stood unsuccessfully for the SNP and the Conservative Party.

In his role as a director of The Haven, a nursing home in Edinburgh, he was forced to close in 2013 when the number of carers fell to just 32.

Mr Doherty's father, John Doherty, was the manager of the home from 1963 to 2013 and is now the manager of the charity HICC, which helps care home staff.

It has been suggested that the fact that the family were so well-connected gave him the confidence to fire the carers because of the shortage.

Mr Doherty was born in Glasgow and is one of three children.

The other two are brothers Peter, who is an accountant, and David, who is a property developer.

Family connections

Mr Doherty's father is now an elected member of the Edinburgh City Council, according to the SNP.

Mr Doherty's political background was shaped by the kind of politics that has dominated Scottish politics for the last decade: the SNP.

His political background was shaped by the kind of politics that has dominated Scottish politics for the last decade - the SNP

At Edinburgh University, he stood for the SNP at his first attempt to stand for Parliament but failed.

He has also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party.

In the early 1990s, he was the chairman of the Scottish Socialist Party.

In 2007, he co-founded the Scottish Socialist Network, which has since become the Scottish Socialist Party.

In January 2012, he became director of the charity HICC.

In the Scottish independence debate, Mr Doherty said: "The people of Scotland have had enough of the SNP.

"It is clear that their policies have produced the worst economic, social and health crisis in modern Scottish history."

He has said his family connections to the SNP helped him to put together the independence case.

"The independence case is not the SNP's to run. The SNP has been in power for nearly 30 years and has done nothing but wreck.

"The SNP has not helped the working people of Scotland at all. They have made it more difficult for people to get a job. They have done nothing to help the most vulnerable. They have failed to build a fairer society."

'Eyes wide open'

But in an interview with BBC Scotland, he said the Scottish National Party had been "failing to build a fairer society" for too long.

"I'm not an ideologue. I don't believe in one way of doing things or another. I'm just looking at it from a pragmatic point of view," he said.

"I think we have a very serious crisis in Scottish life that we have to deal with.

"We have a huge population, we have huge problems with mental health, we have huge problems with housing.

"The only way in which we can have a fairer society is to make sure that we have a fairer economy."

He added: "I have always been at the forefront of the debate on the independence issue and I think that my eyes are wide open to the way Scotland is going."<|endoftext|>Rating: 4.9 - ‎9 reviews - ‎$9.99 - ‎In stock

The state of California has investigating an alleged hate crime in the form of a note left at a mosque which read: "I'm proud to be your Muslim. I'm a soldier."

According to the Sacramento Bee, the note was found at the Islamic Center of Sacramento by the Muslim community and the FBI has been notified.

The center's president, Imam Syed Hussan, said he called the FBI immediately after finding the note on his doorstep.

"It was the most heartfelt message I'd ever received," Hussan told NBC 10. "We have to make sure that this doesn't happen to any other Muslim community."

Hussan said that the statement was left on the door of the mosque by a man in his 20s who was upset that he was being denied entry to the mosque. The man said he was denied entry because he was wearing a turban and had hair dyed in a non-Muslim color.

Hussan said that he had also been physically threatened before, but never intentionally targeted his mosque.

"I have no idea who this individual is," he said.

The FBI said it was investigating the incident.

Hussan said that he and the mosque have a very good relationship with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. He said that his mosque, which is located just down the street from the California Capitol, has been a target of hate before.

"We've had people angry, yelling, shaking their fists, throwing rocks, writing on the mosque, putting up 'build the wall' signs," Hussan said. "It's gotten to a point where we want to get involved. We have to protect ourselves."

Hussan said that he has not heard back from the FBI and that he has been told by the federal agency that they are investigating the incident.

California Gov. Jerry Brown called the incident "deeply disturbing," and said that the state will work closely with the FBI.

"I want to commend the Muslim community for their courage and leadership as they respond to this despicable act that is motivated by bias and hate," Brown said in a statement. "I also want to assure the public that my office is in contact with the FBI and will continue to monitor the situation."

Hussan said that despite the attack, he does not feel that his community is being targeted.

"We are still a very safe place," he said. "We don't feel threatened. We feel very safe."

UPDATE: The FBI has confirmed that the incident is being investigated as a possible hate crime.<|endoftext|>As a Universalist minister, I believe that the Bible is the word of God, and that I have a duty to proclaim this truth.

After weeks of speculation about whether the Senate would pass the tax bill, Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee said he would vote for it.

"I think it's a good bill. I think it's going to help our country," Corker told reporters outside the Senate chamber.

The Senate had been expected to vote on the tax bill tonight, but Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky announced that he could not commit to voting for the bill.

Senator Susan Collins of Maine said she was still reviewing the tax bill.

"I'm still reviewing the final text," she said. "We're going to see what the final bill looks like."

The Senate had been expected to vote tonight on the Republican tax bill, but that appears to be in jeopardy after Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky announced he could not commit to voting for the bill.

"I'm still reviewing the final text," Senator Susan Collins of Maine, another key swing vote, said of the tax legislation. "We're going to see what the final bill looks like."

The Senate is expected to vote on the bill on Tuesday, after the Senate spends much of the week in a marathon session.

Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, was optimistic about the tax bill's chances, but said he needs more information to be sure.

"If this bill is as good as it seems to be, it's going to help millions of families. It's going to help people across the country who have struggled to find jobs and have struggled to make ends meet. It's going to help people of all ages," Wyden said.

Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he has "confidence" the final bill will pass.

"I'm confident that the tax bill that we put forth is solid, that it will provide the kind of economic growth that's needed in this country. I'm confident that it will help our economy increase jobs," he said.

The House and Senate passed their tax legislation in early November.

The final bill has not yet been scored by the Congressional Budget Office. However, several analyses have found that it would slow the growth of the economy and help the wealthy more than the middle class.

The Senate's tax bill also includes a provision giving the Internal Revenue Service more power to target certain taxpayers for audits.

The House bill also made changes to the way individuals can deduct state and local property taxes. The Senate bill does not make those changes.<|endoftext|>The main purpose of this guide is to provide a set of tips and suggestions for the new player, so that they can get a feel for how the game works.

There are currently 15 different upgrades, and each of them has a different benefit. This list will be updated as more upgrades are added.

There are many different types of upgrades, and their cost ranges from 1-30.

A "penny killer" who beat and sexually assaulted a woman in a park has been jailed for at least 10 years.

Steve Beresford, 57, struck the woman in a park in Northampton, Buckinghamshire, in May, St Albans Crown Court heard.

He left her with serious injuries and told police he had cut her with a cleaver.

Judge Ian Pringle said Beresford's actions were "truly shocking".

He said: "You lured this woman into the park, you sexually assaulted her and chased her as she fled the scene.

"You did this in a moment of anger and fuelled by drink.

"You were a coward at the time."

Beresford, of Northampton, was arrested on 16 May after footage of the attack in the park was posted on Facebook.

He admitted one count of rape and one count of sexual assault.

In one video, Beresford is seen on his mobile phone with the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, as he forces her to perform a sex act.

In another video, Beresford is seen laughing as he hits the woman as she flees from him.

Penny has been left with serious injuries and has been left unable to work, for the past five months, her solicitor said.

She has been unable to meet her children and has not been able to leave her home since the incident.

The judge said Beresford had "no real remorse" and had "no capacity to understand how such an appalling and depraved act could occur".

He added: "You are a very dangerous man and I hope your victims will be able to move on."<|endoftext|>I have been searching for a good day care for my kids for nearly two years. First, I decided that I would take one for myself and then, when my kids were older, I would have one for the whole family. I found a good day care, and then I came to the conclusion that I would pay for it myself.

A lot of my friends described this when I first started searching for a day care. "You pay for it yourself," they would say, "and it will be fine because you have a baby."

That made no sense to me. My kids are not in a perfect situation, but even with my "perfect" situation, I still wanted a good day care. I knew that I was paying for it myself (I already had a credit card to pay for the day care), so I thought that I could do the same when my kids were older.

I didn't realize how expensive that was until I actually started paying for it myself and figured out how much it actually cost me. I am definitely not going to be able to pay for everything myself. I know that this can be expensive. But, I am going to do my part.

I am going to share with you the things I spent so far (I am on day 5. They are all in different types of care, so I will update you based on what is available).

Since I am only reading on my own, I will keep it going if you want to comment and ask me questions.

I am going to start with the things that I am not sure if I will be able to afford. And then I am going to make a list of things I should be able to afford.

Day Care

Rent

Food

Groceries

Household items

Make sure I have a good list of things I should be able to afford. I am not sure if I am going to be able to afford everything, but I want to be careful.

What I am not sure if I will be able to afford

Child Care

I don't know if I can afford for my kids to go to child care. I need to know how much it is going to cost me.

I am going to try and buy daycare for my kids. I don't know if I can afford it. It seems like this is a huge expense.

A man who was "unusually intoxicated" when he was arrested for a "brazen" drive-by shooting on the Northwest Side has been found guilty of one count of attempted murder.

Police said the gunfire was fired at four cars in the 4900 block of North Long Avenue about 1:30 a.m. on July 10, 2015.

The bullets hit a parked vehicle, a parked vehicle in the street and a parked vehicle in a driveway, police said. The driver of the parked car was shot in the chest and shoulder.

The driver of the parked vehicle in the street was shot in the head and the passenger was shot in the arm.

The driver of the parked car in the driveway was shot in the arm and the passenger was shot in the head.

The shooting was captured on video by a witness.

The man who was charged with attempted murder was identified in court Thursday as Edward Daniel Spaulding, 24, of the 5800 block of North Orleans Avenue.

He has been ordered held on a $500,000 bond.<|endoftext|>A man who has been charged with attempted murder was in court Friday to enter a plea in a case that began four months ago when police say he fatally shot a woman inside a "bad neighborhood" in Banning.

Luis Robles, 28, of Sacramento, was charged with murder on July 14 in the death of 27-year-old Jessica Stensman of Sacramento. Stensman was found shot in the head on Nov. 29 in a front yard in the 2800 block of Forest Hill Street in Banning, according to a criminal complaint.

She had been shot with an M-1 rifle.

The Sacramento County District Attorney's Office charged Robles on Thursday in connection with the shooting, which happened while he was in the midst of a robbery.

Robles was in court Friday to enter a plea. His attorney, Kevin O'Reilly, said he would strongly represent Robles and would plead not guilty.

"He's extremely upset about the charges," O'Reilly said, adding that Robles shot Stensman during a robbery and said it was an accident.

O'Reilly said Stensman had been at his home to retrieve her car from a car wash before leaving with Robles. The pair, a married couple, had been drinking, O'Reilly said.

Robles was arrested in November after a witness told police he saw Robles get into a car and take a woman to a deserted area on Forest Hill Street. The witness told police that when the woman got out of the car, Robles shot her with an M-1 rifle.

Police found Stensman in the front yard of a home with a gunshot wound to the head, according to the complaint. She died in the hospital the next day.

"We're very concerned," said Banning Police Lt. Bob Mulligan. "We have a lot of questions. We have a lot of things on the table."

Mulligan said investigators may have a motive in the case.

"There could be an attempt to get away with some crimes," he said.

O'Reilly said Robles was in the process of moving out of a home in Banning, which is where he was arrested in November. He said he took his own life in the home at 5900 Royce St. in September.

According to the criminal complaint, police received a call about a robbery in progress at the home at 5 p.m. Tuesday. When officers arrived, they found the front door of the home torn off the hinges and a dead woman lying in the street.

Officers found Stensman's car in the driveway, with a bullet hole in the windshield.

Stensman's family had planned to hold a memorial for her on Friday at 5 p.m. at Banning High School, according to O'Reilly.

Stensman was a recent graduate of Sacramento City College.

Stensman, a native of Riverside, was a member of the Banning Mountain Club and a member of the Sacramento chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

She was also a member of the Banning Rotary Club.

Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call the Banning Police Department at 916-744-7448 or Crime Stoppers at 530-777-8572.

A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the families of Stensman and her husband, Brandon, who was the victim of a car crash earlier this year.

The article is titled "Europe's EFTA judges are split on membership, and the outcome could be a major blow to EU-Turkey relations".

The article starts off with the following quote:

"The members of the EFTA court are so far divided on whether to continue membership without Turkey, according to court documents seen by The Wall Street Journal."

This article is very misleading. Here is the full quote:

"The members of the EFTA court are so far divided on whether to continue membership without Turkey, according to court documents seen by The Wall Street Journal."

These are the members of the EFTA court. The people who comprise EFTA are the EEA states. There are only five members of the EEA, Turkey, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.

The countries that have EFTA membership are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.

The EEA also covers all the European states that are part of the European Union and has a common foreign and security policy. The EEA includes the EFTA states.

The EEA is a bilateral agreement between European countries. It has not been a treaty. It has been a bilateral agreement between the EU and EEA countries. The EEA countries are not in the European Union. They are in the EEA.

The EEA is not an agreement with Turkey. The EEA is an agreement between the EU and the EEA states. There are no negotiations between the EU and the EEA. There is no negotiation between the EU and Turkey. There are no negotiations with Turkey.

According to the article, "The court documents show the judges are divided on whether to continue membership without Turkey".

This is a nonsense statement. The article does not even quote the actual decision of the EEA court that this article refers to. The article is simply quoting the EEA court's decision, without even quoting the actual decision.

The EEA court has made many decisions in the past. In the EEA court's decision about the EU-Turkey accession negotiations, the court said that the accession negotiations could go forward. The EEA court also said that the accession negotiations should be concluded within two years.

The EEA court also said that the accession negotiations should be concluded with the participation of the 28 EU member states.

The EEA court also said that the accession negotiations should be concluded on the basis of the EU-Turkey accession agreement, which was done. The EEA court also said that the accession negotiations could proceed after the accession agreement was concluded.

The EEA court has already decided that the accession negotiations can proceed. It has not been a decision that has been made by the EEA court. It has not said that the EEA court has made a decision.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Acting Director and Deputy Director of the FBI

FROM: James B. Comey, Director

SUBJECT: Re: Russia Investigation

RE: F.B.I. Reforms and Improvements

On May 1, 2017, I sent a memorandum to the Department of Justice (DOJ) recommending that the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) take certain steps to enhance public confidence in the FBI. I also asked the FBI to consider whether it should issue public statements, and if so, what those statements should say.

The memorandum follows:

May 1, 2017

The Honorable James B. Comey

Director

Federal Bureau of Investigation

950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW

Washington, DC 20535

Dear Director Comey:

The FBI's leadership has long been committed to improving its culture and practices. We have, over the past several years, consolidated or changed many of the existing practices and procedures that govern FBI employees and the management of the FBI's work. This memorandum provides an update on those efforts, delineating the key reforms we have implemented and the steps we have taken to improve both the FBI's culture and the way it does business.

The reforms we have implemented include:

Pre-employment screening ensuring that applicants are not disqualified for race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, protected veteran status or any other basis based on the applicant's conduct in the past;

Reforming the use of "insider threat" language in FBI training materials;

Clarifying that the FBI has no interest in investigating individuals who are not alleged to have committed a crime;

Clarifying that the FBI has no interest in investigating individuals who are not alleged to have committed a crime; Assessing the management structure of the FBI to ensure that senior supervisors and managers have the proper authority to make decisions on matters that fall within their areas of responsibility; and

Developing a comprehensive plan to ensure that the FBI is transparent, accountable, and effective in its work.

In light of these reforms, it is my understanding that the FBI has taken steps to produce a report summarizing the progress we have made in combating the threat posed by foreign intelligence services, which is required by Executive Order 12333. To the extent that we have taken steps in this regard, they have been in close collaboration with the Department of Justice.

I believe it is important that I briefly clarify the scope of our reforms. As required by Executive Order 12333, we have implemented the following reforms:

We have moved forward with the development of internal investigations for certain sensitive personnel matters, such as sexual harassment and abuse, where the FBI has discovered credible allegations of criminal conduct against individuals in the FBI. These investigations have been implemented with the guidance of the Department of Justice and have been driven by the FBI's existing policies and practices and the recommendations of an internal review board.

We have taken steps to ensure that the FBI is consistent in its use of the terms "engaged in" and "actively engaged in" in executive branch communications. As a result of these efforts, the FBI will continue to use the language "engaged in" when communicating with the public about its work, and the FBI will continue to use the language "actively engaged in" when communicating with Congress about its work.

We have developed a comprehensive plan to improve the management of the FBI, including reviewing the FBI's management structure. We have undertaken this review in collaboration with the Department of Justice and have reviewed and are in the process of implementing the recommendations from the review board. The plan focuses on enhancing the quality of the FBI's management structure and improving its internal culture.

We have begun implementing reforms at other FBI components to address the lack of accountability within the FBI for its employees. To date, the FBI has been able to identify and address these weaknesses.

Earlier this year, I directed the FBI to create its first-ever National Academy. The FBI will continue to recruit top talent from across the country to serve as members of this Academy. The FBI will continue to seek input from experts, like retired FBI Director William Sessions, who have experience in law enforcement management, to ensure we are addressing the key challenges facing the FBI.

As I have said many times, I believe the FBI is the best in the world in every way. As we work to ensure the FBI is best in the world, we must always remember that we are a small part of the U.S. government. In the words of a favorite song from the 60's, "When we're big, we're still small."

Thank you for your service to this country and I look forward to your continued service.<|endoftext|>The Luther Flight is a private jet owned by the Luther family and operated by the Luther Family Trust.

VICTORIA — The B.C. Teachers' Federation is the most popular party among B.C. residents, according to a new poll of the province's 18,000 teachers.

The 2009 survey conducted by Mainstreet Technologies found the NDP and the Greens were in a statistical tie.

The BCTF has a 38 per cent approval rating among public sector employees, with the Liberals at 30 per cent and the B.C. Conservatives at 26 per cent. (Mainstreet) "It's quite a bit better than what we saw in the last election," said Mainstreet CEO Quito Maggi.

The poll, which was conducted between Feb. 23 and March 2, found the B.C. Liberals were at 41 per cent, the NDP at 35 per cent and the Conservatives at 26 per cent.

"We're seeing a fairly consistent trend," Maggi said.

The B.C. Conservatives and the B.C. Liberals had identical approval ratings of 35 per cent, while the Greens had a 19 per cent rating.

The findings and results of the poll are based on a three-day rolling telephone poll.

The poll was conducted among a random sample of 18,000 people from Monday to Friday, with a margin of error of +/- 1.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

Mainstreet Technologies also conducted two polls in 2009 that found the BCTF in a statistical tie with the Liberals and the NDP.

The survey of 1,000 people found the NDP at 28 per cent and the Liberals at 31 per cent. The Greens were at 14 per cent.

The findings and results of the 2009 poll were based on a three-day rolling telephone poll.

The poll of 1,000 people in the days after the May 9, 2009, election had the Liberals at 32 per cent and the NDP at 32 per cent. The Greens were at 14 per cent.

The results and results of the 2008 poll were based on a three-day rolling telephone poll of 1,000 people from Feb. 27 to March 1, 2008.

The number of students reporting a sexual assault at their university has increased by 30 percent from last year, according to a new report released Wednesday by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.

The report states that one in two women is sexually assaulted while in college. Students and professors say the college assault rate has been increasing for years.

"There's a lot more awareness about it going around these days," said Claire A. Gautreau, co-founder of the Sexual Assault Support Network of Boulder County and a faculty member at the university. "There's a lot of students that are coming forward with their experiences. I think that's great."

Just over half of college women say they experienced a violent assault, the survey found. About one in 10 said they had been raped by a current or former intimate partner.

The survey found that more women who reported sexual violence experienced it on campuses with lower-than-average reporting rates, including the University of Colorado, Colorado State University, the University of Colorado Denver, the University of Colorado Springs and the University of Denver.

The report also found that women who were assaulted experienced a higher rate of alcohol use and more sexual activity than those who did not report being assaulted.

The report noted that the rising number of female victims is consistent with a national study released last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That study found that 8 percent of college women experienced an attempted or completed sexual assault while in college.

The survey found that men who had been sexually assaulted were more likely to be under the influence of alcohol and less likely to have used a condom.

"This is a growing problem that we know about," said Dr. Andrea C. Minter

The next time you're at the mall, be sure to look up at the trees.

A group of giant trees has been added to the list of things that are no longer allowed to be on display at the mall.

The trees, which are over 100 feet tall, are part of a 300-foot-tall master plan for the mall that includes the addition of a neighboring sprawling park.

Sixty-five trees were removed from the mall last year as a result of the project and will be replaced with plants that will become part of the park.

The removal of the trees was part of a larger re-design of the mall to make it more environmentally friendly and more pedestrian-friendly.

The trees were in the middle of a public review process. But due to the extremely tall trees, the plan was put on hold while the project was being reviewed.

The trees were removed in a line on the west side of the mall near the Macy's.

They were removed by the Rochester Parks Department and the park designer and landscaper.

The trees were removed from the mall in January.

Scott O'Neill, director of communications for the City of Rochester, said the trees were removed because they were hard to move.

"They were a safety concern," he said.

It is not the first time the mall has had to remove trees due to safety concerns.

In 2012, the mall decided to remove six trees because they were a safety concern in the middle of a busy road.

Karen King, a spokesperson for Macy's, said the company was not involved in the trees' removal.

At the time, she said safety was a major concern for the company, and that employees were not permitted to use the trees to skateboard, as they could have.

In an emailed statement, she said Macy's was "disappointed" in the decision.

"We look forward to a future with a Macy's at the Mall of America," she said.

The mall is located on the east side of the interstate between I-394 and I-694.

Additional details on the trees are available on the City of Rochester's website.<|endoftext|>A new study published today in the journal Science analysed data collected over the past four decades by NASA's Operation IceBridge missions, which have been mapping global temperatures.

The study, by researchers at the University of Maryland and the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), reveals that the Earth's heat is slowly moving towards its pole and is likely to rise by at least 0.5 C this century as temperatures continue to rise. This is because of increased greenhouse gases.

The study was led by the University of Maryland's James Hansen, the chairman of the NASA advisory council on climate change. It was supported by the NSIDC, NASA, the US Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the US National Science Foundation, and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research.

The study analyzed data from the Operation IceBridge mission, which has been flying over Antarctica since 2002. It found that since 1970, the Earth's average temperature has risen by about 1.5 C, or about 0.8 C per decade. This means that the average temperature over the planet has risen by about 0.6 C since the turn of the century. The ice core record shows that the global average temperature has been rising since the 1940s.

The scientists found that the global average temperature has risen by 0.5 C per century since 1970, but that the Southern Hemisphere has warmed faster than the Northern Hemisphere and the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed faster than both.

The researchers also found that the melting of ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctica, which are contributing to the global warming, are a major contributor to the warming.

"The fact that we are seeing this acceleration and that we are saying this is a major factor is important," said Hansen.

"The most likely scenario is that we will see about 0.5 C of warming per century for the next 50 years, but that will decline to 0.2 C per century thereafter," said Hansen. He said that the 0.2 C per century warming is consistent with the IPCC's projections for the next several decades.

"We are still committed to a 2 C rise," said Hansen. "We are taking the current momentum and accelerating it."

"This is a very extreme temperature increase," said Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research. "Our understanding of the physics of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas, is very, very limited. We just don't understand it well enough to predict what's going to happen in the long run."

"The IPCC is very much overestimating the rate of global warming," said Trenberth.

The last time the Earth was this warm was during the Eemian period,

In the way that I have been shamed into watching everything online, I will now attempt to bury everything else by examining the film of Everything Is Losing It's Shapes.

Here's what the film has to say about itself and its purpose:

You're not here to write a review of The Thing.

You're here to see the story of everything losing it's shapes.

You're not here to find out what's the best music video of the year.

You're here to find out about Kevin Penkin and his film titled Everything Is Losing It's Shapes.

Without further ado, here is the IMAX version of Everything Is Losing It's Shapes.

It is not that the film is bad. It is that the film is not that interesting.

If you are a fan of horror films, you'll have seen the trailer. If you are not a fan of horror films, you will have seen it first.

You will have seen the poster for the flick. They are really, really good.

But if you are asking yourself why I want to watch this film, I want to tell you that this film is not a horror flick.

It is not a science fiction flick. It is not a comedy flick.

It is not a documentary. It is not a drama.

It is a film about how we view our world.

The story of the film is that the first time Kevin Penkin saw the Earth, he was fascinated by it.

He was like, "wow, this is a beautiful place, I'm gonna find out how to live on this beautiful planet".

This was the beginning of his journey to find out how to live on a planet that is a big ball of rock.

After a few years of living on the planet, he gets bored.

He decides to build a rocket to get back home.

But it doesn't work.

So he builds another rocket.

And another.

And another.

Eventually, he builds a giant spaceship and flies to the moon.

While he is there, he is sick of his planet.

He wants to go back home to his weird planet.

The story of the film is that he does, and the film follows his journey back home.

I won't spoil the ending because I don't want to spoil it.

But the story concludes that everything is losing its shapes.

As Kevin Penkin is flying back home, it is the end of the world.

This is a movie about how we feel when we are unhappy with our lives.

I can't say that I know any of the people in the film, but seeing the film as a fan of horror and biography, I found myself really looking forward to an explanation of the film's plot.

I wanted to know what was the point of the film, and why the main character was so unhappy.

I wanted to know what the point was of this film.

Questions like these are necessary to the enjoyment of the film.

In this film, Kevin Penkin gets to a point where he is so unhappy with his life that he decides to destroy it.

This is an idea that is not new, but the film is really good about how the film has to explain the idea.

The film explains the idea that the main character is unhappy because of his inability to be happy.

This is not the first time that the film has explained the idea of happiness.

In the film, the main character is happy on his new planet.

But when he finds out that the planet is dying, he is like, "ah, shit, I hope I can take this pain".

The film finds a way to make the main character happy, and happy is what we want in this world.

The fabled golden dragonflight are a group of dragonflights in the present-day Old World, and are the defenders of Kryta against the Nightmare Court.

The dragonflights were created when the dragons, themselves, rebelled against the Nightmare Court, and they have existed ever since, defending their home against the invasion of the Amalgam of Corruption.

The dragonflights are currently led by the dragon Ata'mal the Voice of the Dragon.

Contents show]

History

The dragonflights were created at some point in the past, and were formed from the blood of dragons slain in the Nightmare Court's invasion of the surface world.

They were formed as a sacrifice to the dragons' gods, the dragons' ancient allies, and they are exceedingly loyal to the dragons. The dragonflights do not worship the gods, however, and they hold the relics and artifacts of the gods close to their hearts.

The first dragonflight to be created was the Golden Flight, who were the first to take up dragonborn as a race. The Golden Flight were made up of the most ambitious, noble, and powerful of the dragons. They were revered as the first and greatest of the dragonflights.

The second dragonflight to be created was the Silver Flight, who were the first to take up the ancient dragon language of the dragons. The Silver Flight were made up of the most timid and humble of the dragons. They were revered as the first and least noble of the dragonflights.

The third and final dragonflight to be created were the Bronze Flight, who were the first to take up an ancient dragon language of the dragons. The Bronze Flight were made up of the most cautious, prudent, and cautious of the dragonflights. They were revered as the first and least cautious of the dragonflights.

The first dragonflight to be destroyed was the Gold Flight, who were the first to take up the ancient dragon language of dragons. The Gold Flight were the first to be defeated by the Nightmare Court.

The current leader of the dragonflights is Ata'mal the Voice of the Dragon, and he is the only one of the three present. Ata'mal led the Golden Flight to their destruction, and was last seen leading the Silver Flight. Ata'mal was considered the most powerful of the dragons, and he was feared by the other dragons for his power and wisdom. He was also considered the most honorable, and thus he became the central figure of the Golden Dragonflight.

The current leader of the Silver Dragonflight is the dragon Ata'mal the Voice of the Dragon. Ata'mal is the least powerful of the three present, and he is feared by the other dragons for his power and wisdom.

The current leader of the Bronze Dragonflight is the dragon Ata'mal the Voice of the Dragon. Ata'mal is the most powerful of the three present, and he is feared by the other dragons for his power and wisdom.

History

The dragons created the dragonflights as a way to protect the mortal races from the corruption that threatens to consume the world. The dragons wanted to protect their own kind, and so they took the most powerful dragons in the mortal races and sacrificed them to their gods.

The dragons took their new creations to the mortal world, though they were not aware that it was the mortal world that was exchanging their own creations for their gods. The dragons took the most powerful of the mortal races and fought them against the other dragons, who were afraid that the new creatures would corrupt the mortal races.

The dragons won the battle of the first dragonflight, but the other dragons realized that the mortal races were in dire need of protection from the corruption of the Amalgam of Corruption. So, they sought out the most powerful of the dragonflights, Ata'mal, and asked him to lead their new armies to battle against the corruption. Ata'mal was a powerful dragon, and he led the Golden and Silver Dragonflights to battle the corruption. As they did so, they sacrificed their creation to Ata'mal. The Amalgam of Corruption was created from the blood of the dragons slain in the Nightmare Court's invasion of the surface world.

The Amalgam of Corruption eventually corrupted the mortal races, and the dragons fled, leaving the mortal races in its path. The mortals would be forced to fight the dragons to stop the Amalgam of Corruption, but the dragons had been weakened by the Amalgam of Corruption, and the mortals were the only ones who could defeat it. With the Amalgam of Corruption defeated, the dragons returned to the dragonflights and returned their creations to their places, but they did not forget their creation. The dragons were convinced that the mortals could be their greatest ally if they were willing to learn the dragonflights' language. So, the dragonflights created the language

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said on Wednesday that since the Brexit vote there had been a "massive" increase in business confidence, and the government was committed to delivering growth and jobs.

"The economic climate is very different," Hammond told the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), during a speech in which he urged Britain's business to remain in the EU.

"The economic uncertainty of the last few months has not really been felt. The markets have been pretty calm. There has been a massive increase in confidence," he said.

"The government has been clear that we want to deliver economic growth," he added.

But Hammond also said that the government would not be able to deliver much growth without increased investment, with the economy being boosted by a return to growth in the United States, which will create over 1 million jobs.

He also said that Britain's new immigration policy would affect the composition of the economy.

"I think that really is a very significant factor," he said. "We want a country that works for everyone, to have the kind of economy that we want to build, and that will include immigration."

But he added that he would not be "complacent" about Brexit, suggesting that the government would be working with business to deliver a Brexit that would be in the interests of both sides.

"We will be there to work with business," he said. "But I think the Government will be able to deliver a Brexit that's in the interests of both sides."<|endoftext|>I think we're all pretty familiar with the problem of what to call a contract. If you're writing a simple C# program, it's not a huge deal. You just call it a function and it works just fine. But, if you're writing something more complicated, you might want to use a contract to represent your dependency graph.

Contracts are nothing new. They have been around since the dawn of C. However, the way in which they are used in modern languages has changed substantially. Instead of being self-contained units, contracts tend to be combined and combined into larger modules. For instance, in Java, you might have a module, such as the one shown here:

public interface IContract { Task<T> DoSomething(); }

In that example, the T in the DoSomething() method is represented by a contract. Since the IContract interface is defined in another module, you can call the DoSomething() method in the IContract module and be assured that the DoSomething() method will have the same result.

In Go, you would have something more like the following:

type Contract struct { var taskT T Task } func (ctxt Contract) DoSomething() { // calls DoSomething() in the contract }

The main thing to note here is that the function does not have to be in the same module as the interface definition (although it usually is). In Go, you can use multiple interfaces in the same module as long as they are all implemented by the same functions (e.g. a shared struct).

In some cases, this approach may be preferable; for instance, if you want the method to be available from multiple modules. But, since Go is statically typed, you cannot use this approach to represent a dependency graph in a dynamically typed language such as Java. Instead, you would have to use a graph-based approach that combines the interfaces into larger modules.

So, in this post, I will show you how to create your own contract in Go, which can then be used to represent a dependency graph.

Genesis

Before we can create our own contract, we have to know a bit about Go's binary tree.

This is a bit technical, so if you don't have a strong background in binary trees or linked lists, feel free to skip this section.

In binary trees, there are two kinds of nodes: empty nodes and children. Empty nodes are nodes that have no children, and children are nodes that have at least one child.

Let's say we have a binary tree with a node in it named a . The empty nodes are nodes named b and c , which has no children. The children nodes are nodes named d and e , which has one child. We can take the children of a node and turn them into empty nodes using the following recursion:

nt := &a // empty node nt.nodes[0] = nil // empty node nt.nodes[1] = nil // empty node nt.nodes[2] = nil // empty node nt.nodes[3] = nil // empty node

The Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released its annual transparency rankings on Friday, which included rankings of government transparency compared to the other 34 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

The U.S. was in the top two for six of the eight categories, with China in fourth place and Sweden in fifth place.

READ MORE: U.S. government spending: The most transparent countries in the world

"The United States is a shining example of the rule of law and the importance of open government," CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement. "Our government is transparent and citizens have the right to know how their government spends their taxes, how it spends their money, and how it makes decisions that affect their lives."

The report also ranked the U.S. based on how much money it spends on its annual operations on record, as well as spending on foreign aid, infrastructure and defense.

The U.S. is also the only country to rank in the top 10 for government transparency in all eight categories, according to CREW.

On defense, the report said the U.S. spends more than the next seven countries combined, and is the only country to rank in the top 15 in the categories of spending on international affairs, health care and education.

But the report also said that the U.S. has a higher percentage of its yearly budget spent on defense than any other country, and that it is the only country to rank in the top 10 for both military spending and the amount of money spent on defense in each category.

"The United States has the most powerful military in the world," said Jim Graham, the executive director of CREW. "More money is going to the military than any other country in the world. But it's not the most transparent."

The U.S. is also the only country with a military in every category except health care. The U.S. has the military in five of the eight categories, and is the only country to rank in the top 10 for health care spending.<|endoftext|>A person who is stuck in a state of deep, profound, and unceasing depression.

The German government says it is "increasingly concerned" about the threat posed by the Islamic State and would not rule out sending ground troops into Syria to fight the terrorist group.

At a news conference on Tuesday, the German Defense Ministry said it was examining whether it could send a special forces unit to Syria to help combat the threat.

"We see the necessity of increasing our work against the threat posed by Islamic State," Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said at the news conference.

"A special forces team is being set up," she added.

On Tuesday morning, the German government announced that Germany would send a special forces team to Jordan to help train Syrian rebels in order to strengthen the moderate opposition.

Germany has so far deployed around 900 troops to help train and equip moderate Syrian rebels.

Germany has also sent up to a dozen weapons teams to the region in recent months, but the government said they could not have been sent to Syria yet because of the high number of other countries involved.

The United States, Britain, France, Turkey, Qatar and other countries are all involved in the air war against IS.

Germany has been on high alert since the November 13 attacks in Paris that killed 130 people, most of them at the Bataclan concert hall.

Germany has also been on high alert since a suicide bombing and shooting in Ansbach that killed at least 15 people in July.

The country has been on high alert ever since it emerged that two teenage boys were arrested last month on suspicion of planning a possible terror attack in the country.

The suspects are reported to have made a list of targets in Germany and had discussed beinghead people for the Islamic State.

Whales and dolphins have been found to have a taste for foreign substances. The most well-known cases were recorded in the 1960s when Russian researchers found that bottlenose dolphins and sperm whales could be attracted to fence posts with an electrical potential. Now, researchers from the University of Southern Denmark have shown that cetaceans are interested in an odor that is too strong to be detected by the human nose.

The researchers are not certain why whales and dolphins like the smell, but they believe that the brain of the mammals is using the smell to make sense of the world around them. The study was published in the journal Physiology & Behavior.

When the Danish researchers studied the brain activity of whales and dolphins they found that the whales were detecting the smell in the same way that we do. The dolphins were also able to identify the smell, which suggests that they can also detect the strange odor.

The scientists created a computer model of the brain and trained it to recognize odors. Then they tested the model on an odor that was too strong to be smelled by human nose. When the model was trained to identify the smell, it showed strong response in the brain.

The researchers also found that the response in the brain was different for males and females. The males had a stronger response than the females. The researchers think that the males seem to be using the smell to find their mates.<|endoftext|>A teenage girl is in hospital in Birmingham with life-threatening injuries after a car ploughed into a crowd of people celebrating the Eid celebrations in the city.

The incident happened when a white vehicle crashed into crowds gathered on Birmingham's Albert Square at around 3.30pm, around 45 minutes after Eid prayers had ended.

A spokesperson for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: "We are currently treating a 16-year-old girl for serious leg injuries.

"The girl was taken to the Royal Children's Hospital.

"She is in a critical condition and we are expecting her to make a full recovery."

The spokesman said the ambulance service was called to the scene and the girl was taken to the Royal Children's Hospital, Birmingham by ambulance.

The spokesperson said: "The driver of the vehicle has been arrested, we are not in a position to provide further details.

"We continue to liaise with the police."

The incident has been described as a "horrific incident" by Birmingham City Council leader John Clancy.

He said: "This is a terrible tragedy. Our thoughts are with all those involved and their families."

Police confirmed the incident was being treated as a road traffic collision and that there were no reports of anyone being injured during the incident.

In the past, when it came to the "breakfast" portion of the American diet, we were mostly concerned with the kind of high-fat, high-sugar, high-carb breakfast that (for most of us) consisted of fried eggs, eggs benedict or scrambled eggs.

But thanks to the "fast food" craze, added sugar is now a part of most meals, and the breakfast menu has changed.

Here's a look at the latest trends in breakfast.

Breakfast Snacks

"Snack" is the new breakfast. Snacks have become one of the most common and popular menu items in the U.S., and they're now the third most popular food in America after breakfast and lunch.

"Snack" is just what it sounds like: food that is eaten with the intent to be eaten quickly, usually in the middle of the day.

Some of the most popular snack items include chips, toast, pretzels, French toast, and popsicles.

Some of the most popular snack items include chips, toast, pretzels, French toast, and popsicles.

The Snack was invented during the Great Depression. It was an attempt to make food seem more enticing by combining it with alcohol and sugar.

"Breakfast" Scrambled Eggs

Or "Scrambled Eggs" as it is called in many parts of the country.

Scrambled eggs were originally a breakfast food in the 1800's, but they're not a traditional breakfast food. They were usually served as a side dish alongside bread, and they didn't have much nutritional value.

But in the 1950's and 60's, the "scrambled egg" was re-invented as a quick, easy, and healthy breakfast food.

Scrambled eggs became popular after a series of television commercials featuring the late Jim Henson, who played the role of Scrooge McDuck in the classic Disney TV series and movies.

People also started eating breakfast and lunch on television, and scrambled eggs became part of the mainstream American diet.

Crispy, Fried, Fried, Fried

In the past, the breakfast portion of the American diet was mostly made up of fried foods and eggs. That's still true, but it's not the main focus of the American breakfast.

Instead, Americans are now eating a variety of different foods in the morning. Also, the breakfast menu is changing.

Fried foods are still a big part of the breakfast, but most Americans now eat breakfast on a wide variety of foods. Instead of fried foods, many people are now eating scrambled eggs.

Scrambled eggs are still a big part of the breakfast, but most Americans now eat breakfast on a wide variety of foods.

Pancakes and waffles have been trendy breakfast foods for a few years now.

Breakfast Sausages

In the past, the breakfast sausage was made of pork sausage. But for reasons that are still unknown, American sausage manufacturers have been trying to make their sausage taste more like chicken.

However, there are many different types of sausage, and they all taste different.

If you want to try the "traditional" breakfast sausage, there are many different types. Some of the most popular are:

Italian Sausage

Hot Sausage

French Sausage

Corned Beef and Cheddar Sausage

Bacon Sausage

Gruyere Sausage

Other Tricks

In addition to the traditional breakfast foods, Americans are now also trying to get creative with their breakfast.

And we're not talking about breakfast burritos.

The breakfast burger craze is a big deal in the U.S., but there are many different kinds of breakfast burrito. And breakfast tacos are becoming more popular than ever.

Bacon and Eggs

If you thought bacon and eggs were a popular breakfast item, you're in for a treat. In the past, bacon and eggs just meant fried eggs. But now it's a breakfast that can include many different kinds of eggs including bacon, hard-boiled eggs, and scrambled eggs.

See for yourself.

Cereal Squares

Cereal squares are a favorite breakfast item in the U.S. It's basically just a square of cereal with some kind of filling inside.

It's not the most healthy breakfast food, but it's a great quick breakfast option for those who want something quick and easy.

The sun was still bright as the boy put on his shoes and briskly walked toward the front door, where he would always find his mother waiting. The boy would always see his mother, though he would never know her name. Each day before school he would hear her from a distance. She would be working at the store, certainly. She would be taking care of the children. He never realized what she did for a living until he was in high school. He never saw his mother for months at a time, every day, but he would always hear her. She would be reading to a child, feeding a baby. She would be teaching a child to walk. He would never see his mother, but he would always hear her, and that was enough.

The boy knew that one day the two of them would be reunited, but he was hoping it would be a far off time, waiting for the day when he would grow up and leave his mother. But he was wrong.

The boy was no longer a boy. He was a man.

The sun was a long way away, but the boy knew that the time had come for a return trip to the store. The boy knew that he would never be able to walk to the front door without his mother, but he knew that he could go back and visit her some other time. He never knew what he would find there, but he knew that he would find his mother there waiting for him.

When the store was closed, the boy walked to his mother's place. He knocked on the door and waited.

There was a moment of silence until the boy heard his mother's voice.

"Come in, son."

The boy stepped into the house and was greeted by his mother's face.

"Oh, what a pleasant surprise! I didn't think you would come. I just checked the store and it's closed for the day. I thought you might be out somewhere."

"I'm sorry, mom. I shouldn't have come. I just wanted to see the store."

"I understand, son. You're always welcome here. I guess I had forgot that you were a boy. I didn't know that you were in a girl's body."

"I'm not in a girl's body, mom."

"Ohhhhhh, you are?"

"Yes, mommy."

"Then why do you always have to hide in the bathroom?"

"Mom, I've been in the bathroom for a very long time. I just want to go home. I don't want to wear dresses."

"Ohhhhh, don't be so sensitive. I don't want to wear dresses either."

"I know, mommy. I know. But I just want to go home."

"What's wrong, son? Why don't you just come out? Why do you always hide in the bathroom?"

"Mommy, I'm scared."

"Oh, son, don't be scared. I'm here for you. I'm always here for you."

"I'm scared because I'm a boy."

"Ohhhhh, what a sensitive child. Do you like dressing up? Do you like to wear dresses? Do you like dressing like a girl?"

"Mommy, I don't want to dress up at all."

"I know, son. But you're a boy. You're a boy. You're a boy. Why do you always have to hide in the bathroom?"

"Mommy, I told you I don't want to dress like a girl. I don't want to dress like a girl. I don't want to wear dresses."

"Son, you've been in the bathroom for quite awhile. How long have you been in there?"

"Mommy, I don't know. I think it's been a while."

"I'm sorry, son. You know you're a boy. You know you're a boy. Look, you're a boy. You're a boy. You're a boy."

"Mommy, I don't want to be a boy. I want to be a girl."

Boulder, CO: A new study shows that the use of our hair to make animal glue is a modern phenomenon, 100 years earlier than the use of wax.

The work focuses on a group of bees working as a "bee glue factory," and the methods used to produce this widely used ingredient.

The bees collect the wax from a wax bee and mix it with resin and/or beeswax. They then apply this mixture to the beeswax, and then waxes to produce a paste.

The researcher's found that beeswax would have been used in the past, but the bees were not able to make it.

The researchers were able to trace the use of beeswax to the 16th century in England, but after that, the beeswax production process was lost. The beeswax was then used to make a variety of other products, such as candles and soaps.

The researchers believe that the bees glue was new to the world of chemicals in the late 1600s, and, as a result, this process was not widely used until the late 1700s.

The research was recently published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology.<|endoftext|>The return of the Electronic Arts' buggy and unrefined Battlefield series could have been a bit good news for the publisher, but it was overshadowed by the announcement of the launch of the PlayStation 4.

The E3 conference saw the release of the PlayStation 4 and the PC version of Battlefield 4. The PlayStation 4 was a visionary product, designed to bring gamers something different than because of its consoles predecessor. The hardware was a major leap forward for the company, and the power of the processor allowed for the user to play better games.

The PlayStation 4 was a huge step forward for the company, but the Xbox One and the PC have a new chance to shine.

Electronic Arts' The Last of Us, the most critically acclaimed game of 2013, was announced for the Xbox One, next-generation console that features a powerful processor that runs at top speed. The game, originally created by Naughty Dog, was also confirmed to be coming to the PlayStation 4. The game itself is the biggest game to ever be released on the PlayStation 4, surpassing Battlefield 4 in terms of sales, and should prove to be a major hit among gamers.

Whereas the last generation of consoles had a great year, 2014 could be a huge year for the Xbox One as well. Two exclusive titles, Halo 5: Guardians and Forza Motorsport 5, are on the way. The Halo 5: Guardians will be released on November 6, 2014, and Forza Motorsport 5 is expected to be released on November 15, 2014.

"We know our fans want more games like the Halo franchise, and we're dedicated to delivering even more great games to them in 2014," said Phil Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xbox. "With the launch of Halo 5: Guardians and Forza Motorsport 5, we are excited to deliver two major franchises on Xbox One this year that will launch a year apart, as well as our first-ever full-game add-on for Forza Motorsport 5."

Both games are expected to be released most likely in the first or second half of this year. The first game will be a new installment in the long-running franchise and the sequel will be an enhanced version of the game.

The Xbox One's advantage over the PlayStation 4 is that it has a powerful processor that runs at top speed. This allows gamers to play games at a speed that is not possible on the PlayStation 4. The PlayStation 4 has a powerful processor, but it is unable to run at the top speed that the Xbox One can.

The Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 are expected to be released this November.<|endoftext|>The owners of the L.A. Times have called for the ouster of President and Publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. in a scathing editorial published Wednesday.

The paper's opinion page editor, John Tierney, and opinion editor, Phil Bronstein, wrote that the paper's newsroom has been "infected with a toxic virus of self-righteousness" under Sulzberger, "translating into self-righteousness in the management of the paper itself."

"We have been paying for a substandard product — a third-rate version of the Times," the paper's editors wrote, calling for the ouster of Sulzberger.

In recent months, the Times has come under fire for a series of coverage that has been described as racially insensitive. In December, the paper ran an editorial urging President Obama to seek a second term.

The paper has drawn criticism recently for its reporting. The Los Angeles Times published a blistering story this week about the paper's use of anonymous sources, which some critics said was reckless.

"The Times is currently conducting a cover-up," Bronstein wrote in an editorial published Wednesday. "

The energy content of natural gas is more than twice as high as the energy content of coal. Natural gas has a higher carbon content than either coal or oil. The carbon content of natural gas is approximately 20% higher than the carbon content of coal.

Natural gas is a heavier fuel than either oil or coal. This is because the volume of natural gas is much smaller than that of oil and coal. As a result, a greater fraction of natural gas is converted to a form that can be burned for energy, compared with either oil or coal.

Natural gas is a liquid at room temperature and a gas at atmospheric pressure. Gas is used in many industrial processes that require a liquid, such as the production of plastics and ammonia. Gas also is used in the transportation sector. For example, natural gas is used in the transportation sector as a fuel for power plants and for heating homes and businesses. In addition, natural gas is used to generate electricity.

While natural gas has a much higher energy content than oil and coal, its carbon content is lower than that of either oil or coal. Natural gas contains about half the carbon of coal, but about three-quarters of the carbon of oil.

Natural gas is mostly methane. Methane is a greenhouse gas that traps 31 times as much heat as carbon dioxide. The 32,000-foot-high methane plume in the North Pole may be the most significant source of methane in the atmosphere. Methane is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the world. It is also the most potent greenhouse gas. Methane can be released from natural gas production, processing, and storage.<|endoftext|>A- A+

The federal government has so far spent $24 million in taxpayer money to provide housing to homeless veterans.

And it's not ending the crisis.

In total, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has spent $37 million in taxpayer money on homeless veterans since 2010, according to data released under the Freedom of Information Act. Officials say some of the money was used for rent assistance or to pay for some of the most basic needs of veterans who are homeless.

The VA has spent more than $10 million providing rent assistance to veterans from 2009 to 2014.

The agency has also spent $3 million over the past five years to provide veterans with emergency shelter.

"It's a huge problem," said U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., who chairs the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.

He's urging the VA to spend more money on housing veterans.

Miller said it's a "no-brainer" to spend more money on housing veterans, given the estimated 1.3 million veterans who are homeless, many of them veterans in transitional housing programs.

"It's a critical priority for the VA and a critical priority for Congress," Miller said.

The VA spent $5.7 million on emergency housing for homeless veterans from 2009 through 2014. The agency spent $1.4 million on rent assistance for homeless veterans from 2009 through 2014.

The agency has spent more than $2.2 million since 2010 on transitional housing, which includes halfway houses and other supportive housing programs.

Miller said the agency has also spent more than $1 million since 2010 on housing veterans who are pregnant or who have children.

The department spent $3.3 million on rent assistance for pregnant women since 2010.

"There are many, many more veterans in transitional housing than we previously knew," said Kate Davis, a spokeswoman for the VA's office of community services.

Davis said the agency has budgeted $35 million for housing veterans this year.

She said the agency is also working on a new plan that will provide more help for veterans who are homeless.

In the meantime, Davis said, the VA is working to find more permanent housing for homeless veterans.

"We're committed to finding housing for veterans that are homeless," Davis said. "We're also committed to helping veterans find housing."

The VA has also spent $5.3 million on mental health programs for veterans.

Miller said he is concerned about the number of veterans who are homeless. He said it's shocking to him that the VA has spent $37 million on housing homeless veterans.

"I think it's not right," Miller said. "We've got to figure out some way to stop this runaway."

He said he's working on legislation that would allocate more money to the VA for housing homeless veterans.

Miller said he's eager to work with the VA to find a solution.

"I'm not going to give up," he said.

Miller's bill to allocate more funds to the VA for housing homeless veterans has been referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.

Undoubtedly, the right wing and the Tea Party are the most unhinged and insane groups in the country, and have fought the government tooth and nail to take away our freedoms and our second amendment rights. The Tea Party has gone to extreme lengths to include more restrictions into the Constitution, using the "Supreme Court" as a fig leaf to advance their agenda.

In the case of the Kansas State Senate election (which is the end of the term for Republicans), a Tea Party group attempted to send a letter to all 50 state senators, which was signed by 38 of them, as well as the Kansas Secretary of State. The letter called on the state to pass a law requiring voter ID.

The letter called the Kansas legislature's effort to "ensure that all additional elections in Kansas are conducted in a manner that is consistent with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993," an attempt to make the state's electoral process more consistent with the National Voter Registration Act. The National Voter Registration Act requires states to be able to register voters at the polls and to use the National Change of Address system to update voters' addresses.

The letter is extremely confusing and fails to explain just what the National Voter Registration Act does. It states, "The National Voter Registration Act ("NVRA") requires the Secretary of State to issue voter registration documentation to all registered voters in Kansas if the Kansas Secretary of State determines that the voter registration form submitted by the registered voter is complete and accurate and that the voter has provided all required information." The letter goes on to say that, "The Secretary of State shall also issue voter registration documentation to all other eligible voters in Kansas if the Kansas Secretary of State determines that the voter registration form submitted by the registered voter is complete and accurate and that the voter has provided all required information."

The National Voter Registration Act was passed in 1993. It requires states to be able to register voters at the polls and to use the National Change of Address system to update voters' addresses. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is not a law that was passed by the Kansas Senate and House. It is a law that was passed by the US Congress, the US Secretary of State, and the governors of both the state and the federal government.

The letter is confusing because, "The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires the Secretary of State to issue Voter Registration Documentation to all registered voters in Kansas if the Kansas Secretary of State determines that the voter registration form submitted by the registered voter is complete and accurate and that the voter has provided all required information." The letter continues, "The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires the Secretary of State to issue Voter Registration Documentation to all other eligible voters in Kansas if the Kansas Secretary of State determines that the voter registration form submitted by the registered voter is complete and accurate and that the voter has provided all required information."

What, you say. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires the Secretary of State to issue Voter Registration Documentation to all registered voters in Kansas if the Kansas Secretary of State determines that the voter registration form submitted by the registered voter is complete and accurate and that the voter has provided all required information?

The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is not an "act" that was passed by the Kansas Senate and House. It is not a law that was passed by the US Congress, the US Secretary of State, and the governors of both the state and the federal government. It is not a "law" that affects the right of Kansasians, or any other state, to register to vote.

The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is a law that was passed by the US Congress, the US Secretary of State and the governors of both the state and the federal government. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is a law that is not being enforced by the Kansas State Government. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is not a law that was passed by the Kansas Senate and House, and is not a law that was passed by the US Congress, the US Secretary of State, and the governors of both the state and the federal government.

The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is being enforced by the Kansas State Government because the Kansas State Government has changed the rules regarding the use of the National Change of Address System, and has been trying to enforce the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 as part of that change.

A few days ago I read this: "The internet is another way of communicating with people, another way of connecting to people, another way of connecting with other people." This is the way we measure the power of the internet, and it's a great way to measure the power of the internet with all of its flaws.

Let's start with the obvious: it's a terrible method of communication. It's the last resort, and it's a terrible method of communication. It's a way of communicating which says to people "I'm as stupid as you are, I will never be able to figure out how to communicate with you because I don't even know what you're talking about."

Somewhere, there is a guy who is looking at a screen and trying to figure out how to communicate with a person, and he's trying to communicate with an imaginary person. There is no way to communicate with an imaginary person, and there is no way to connect with an imaginary person.

Now let's look at one of the ways that the internet is supposed to be used: kind of like a conversation.

We are all supposed to have a conversation, but what we're really trying to do is communicate with something, not just talk to something. A conversation is a way of communicating with something; it's a way of communicating with a person, and it's a way of communicating with other people.

But when we talk to people on the internet, we're not trying to communicate with anything. We're talking to people, and that's not a good way to communicate with people.

We're supposed to be communicating with other people. We're supposed to be talking to people, and that's another way of communicating with people.

What does that look like in practice? It looks like the internet is a horrible, horrible way to communicate.

There are two problems with the internet: one, it's not a good communication tool, and two, it's not a good way for people to communicate with each other.

The internet is a way of communicating, but it's not a good way of communicating. It's not a way of communicating with people, it's a way of communicating with the internet. It's a way of communicating with the internet, and people don't want to have a conversation with anything. They want to connect to other people. It's not a good way to communicate with other people.

A conversation is a way of communicating with people. It's a way of communicating with an imaginary person. It's a way of communicating with other people. It's not a good way to communicate with other people.

They want to connect to other people. It's not a good way to communicate with other people.

In the wake of a horrific shooting in Las Vegas last night, the NRA is once again calling for more gun control. But as I've written before, we've seen this movie before.

The NRA's campaign against more gun control rests on two core issues:

An argument that such controls would somehow infringe on the 2nd Amendment. A counterargument that prosecuting a "bad guy" with a gun might be necessary, but that we can't have it all.

The NRA's "bad guy" defense is never far from the surface, and it's always a bandage used to cover the gaping wound that is America's mental health system.

We know that for some, guns are a means to an end; to kill, to commit a crime, and to defend oneself. But for most of us, guns are just tools. They help us hunt, for fun, and to defend ourselves from a possible attacker.

The NRA's ill-conceived and easily debunked segment on Crime Watch Daily, "The Gun Show Loophole," is just the latest example of how the gun lobby uses guns to defend an anti-gun agenda.

This is what the NRA has taught us: guns are not the problem; mental illness is.

The first problem is the foundation of the gun lobby's argument against more gun control.

The NRA has never refused to defend the 2nd Amendment. They proudly defend it, and they fight tooth and nail to defend it.

But the 2nd Amendment is not the only thing the NRA defends. As the tables are turned, the NRA's "bad guy" defense becomes an excuse to attack gun control.

The argument is simple: If we require firearms to be registered, and if we require gun owners to have mental health screenings to buy a gun, then somehow criminals will get their hands on guns.

The NRA's arguments are based on the idea that criminals don't get their hands on guns through the normal channels.

They just don't.

In 2013, the FBI's report on "Offender Screenings" showed that only 2.1 percent of people arrested for gun-related crimes had a criminal history. That's not a huge number.

But the problem with the NRA's argument is that it's based on the flawed assumption that if criminals don't get their hands on guns, then gun owners will.

The NRA's "bad guy" argument is based on the idea that gun owners are a danger to themselves.

This is the gun lobby's driving principle. If gun owners aren't a danger to themselves, then no one would need guns to protect themselves.

It's not a new argument. The NRA has long been peddling this line of thinking.

In 1992, the NRA sued to prevent a ban on assault weapons. The NRA argued that "assault weapons" are "designed for, and likely to be used in, mass murder and suicide, specifically, the commission of the felonies of murder and suicide."

In 1994, the NRA's co-founder, Charlton Heston, came out with his own rebuttal in a Huffington Post article, "The Gun Debate: It's the Culture, Stupid."

Heston wrote that "it is absurd to think that criminals will obey any law that requires them to surrender their firearms."

In 1993, NRA board member and former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ) addressed a mass shooting in the lobby of the Washington Navy Yard, where 13 people were killed, and dozens wounded.

Giffords blamed the nation's gun culture, and the NRA's harsh gun control laws, for the shootings.

Giffords said, "What we've seen over and over again is that when we pass laws that are restrictive, they don't do what they're supposed to do."

In 2013, the NRA published an article with the title, "What if America's Gun Laws Are Broken?"

The NRA wrote: "If America's gun laws are broken, mass shootings like the one today will continue to happen day after day. The only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun… if America's gun laws are broken, the only recourse for the victims is to arm themselves."

This is a problem.

The gun lobby's argument that guns are a means to an end is not just wrong, it's dangerous.

The NRA's "bad guy" argument is a dangerous fantasy, designed to convince us that we need a gun to protect ourselves.

It's a fantasy that allows the NRA to scapegoat gun control advocates for the violence that happens every day.

Gun control advocates are not to blame for the violence that occurs every day. (Bolding is mine.)

And gun control advocates, like the NRA, are not people who would like to see more guns in the hands

Tallinn, Estonia

I was staying in Tallinn for a few days for a conference. I was going to have a night out with some friends, but it was raining, and I couldn't get my bike out of the rain. I don't like being wet. So I asked my friend, "What's a good place to stop for a few minutes so I can get my bike out of the mud." He replied, "Oh, do you want to go to Kalevala? It's a station in the neighborhood, and it's completely free. Your friends can take you there for free." I was surprised. I was thinking, "What do you mean, 'completely free'? Are you saying that there's no money involved?"

I said, "Yes, of course. I don't have any money." He said, "Oh, you're kidding." So I said, "Listen, I don't understand, why would you offer to go to Kalevala for free? It's a completely free station?" He said, "Oh, I don't know. I guess it's because I have a group of friends that come to the station all the time." I was a little skeptical. He says, "Well, I guess you can go there for free. It's just a bunch of people hanging around." I said, "Come on, I never had any group of friends before."

In my mind, I was thinking, "What is he talking about? He can't give me a free trip to Kalevala." But he said, "No, of course not. I don't want to get you into trouble. It's just a place for people to hang out and share stories." I was thinking, "Why would you want to do that? Is he going to get me into trouble?"

I said, "Well, I guess I should just grab my bike and go." He said, "You can just get in line. It's free. Just get in line." So I said, "Okay." So I get in line, and they take me to the station. They let me go into the station and then they just say, "Okay, you're free to go. You can go." I was thinking, "What the hell is going on here?" He said, "No, no, no, you're free to go. Just go in line."

So I'm thinking, "I don't understand, how can he be so stupid?" I'm thinking, maybe he's not being told the whole story. So I'm thinking, "How am I going to get into trouble? I don't have any money. I don't have a credit card. I don't have any money. I'm going to get in trouble." So I'm thinking, "Okay, I'll just go in line. I don't have to pay anything."

So I get in line, and I see the guy in front of me. He's sitting there with his bike. He had his bike out of the mud. I said, "Hey, are you going to go with me?" He says, "No." I said, "Are you crazy? It's free. Just go." He says, "No." I said, "Okay, fine, then I'll just go."

So I get in line, and I see the guy in front of me. He's sitting there with his bike. He had his bike out of the mud. I said, "Hey, are you going to go with me?" He says, "No." I said, "Are you crazy? It's free. Just go." He says, "No." I said, "Okay, fine, then I'll just go."

I see the guy in front of me walking up the stairs. I thought, "Oh, I don't know if this guy is going to follow me up the stairs." So I just started walking up the stairs. I didn't know if he was going to follow me or not. So I said, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey." He didn't say anything. So I walked up the stairs.

I'm walking up the stairs, and I see a guy in the middle of the stairs. He's looking down at me, and he's got a slight smile on his face. I thought, "What the hell is going on? This guy's following me?" So I turned around and I said, "Hey, hey. I'm sorry I don't have any money, but is there any way I could get a ride?" He said, "No." I said, "Okay, fine. Do you have any money?" He says, "No." I said, "Okay, great." I walked towards him, and I just said, "I don't have any money. Can I get a ride?" He said, "No

The government's policy regarding the expansion of the Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank is in "dangerous decline," a senior official at the Foreign Ministry warned on Saturday.


The official, who requested anonymity, said the current situation in the Middle East was so dangerous that Israel could potentially face a regional war.


JPOST VIDEOS THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU:

"The government's policy regarding the expansion of the Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank is in danger of deteriorating, and Israel's position on the matter is in danger of becoming irrelevant," the senior official said. "The government's stance on the settlement issue is unlikely to have any practical impact on the peace process, but we are concerned that it may have an impact on the regional arena."The official said that the government's refusal to preemptively recognize settlements in the West Bank – which would be a "grave mistake" – only serves to isolate the government on the matter.On Friday, Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said that the creation of new settlements is "not our policy.""I don't have any intention of doing that," Ya'alon told Army Radio. "It would be a very difficult decision and it would probably be a mistake."Last month, Ya'alon said that the issue of new settlements was not one for the government, and that it is up to the international community whether it takes sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Ya'alon's remarks came after the UN Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements, which the Israeli government has vowed to veto.Israel has repeatedly refused to recognize the UN resolution as a binding international agreement.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month that he will not recognize the UN resolution, and that the Israeli government would not be bound by it. The government said it would not be bound by the international agreement on the West Bank that was reached at the end of June.The plan to build more than 700 new housing units in East Jerusalem, in a move that would further annex the eastern sector of the city, has provoked a series of protests across the West Bank."The government's stance on settlement building is not going to make a difference in the conflict, but it will hinder Israel's ability to maintain its security and to maintain good relations with the international community," the senior official said. "It will have a significant impact on the Israeli public as well as the international community."

With the upcoming release of the sequel to Will Smith's "Concussion," there has been a lot of talk about concussions in football.

In the movie, Will Smith plays Dr. Bennet Omalu, who discovered that football players have a higher rate of brain disease than the average American. Smith was the first to describe CTE, which is now known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

There have been a lot of negative headlines about the movie, and some of them are overblown. But a lot of the coverage has been about the movie's portrayal of Omalu, and the fact that he's a white man who is a football expert.

The reality is that Omalu is an African-American neuropathologist who was once a defensive back at the University of Pittsburgh. He has a doctorate in pathology. He was one of the first scientists to test the brain tissue in players with suspected concussions to see if there were signs of CTE. He was one of the few neuropathologists to be nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine.

In fact, he won the award in 2014. He's also married with children.

But Smith's character is portrayed as a white, male football expert. When I wrote the positive reviews for the movie, I was approached by many people who said they thought the movie gave a good portrayal of Omalu.

But I think that depiction is misguided.

The movie left out one important thing about Omalu: He is a scientist. As a scientist, he has studied brain disease, and he has a very thorough understanding of the brain.

In the movie, he doesn't say anything about the role of football in CTE.

He doesn't say anything about the fact that football has caused more brain disease deaths in the past few decades than motor vehicle accidents, cancer, heart disease and suicide combined.

He doesn't say anything about the fact that the NFL is still denying — and refuses to acknowledge — that there's a link between football and CTE.

His wife was quoted in the movie saying that she saw CTE in her husband's brain after he died. But in real life, she said she saw signs of CTE in him before he died, but she didn't know what it was, or what it meant.

The movie even showed Omalu's wife, played by Nicole Kidman, killing a fly with her bare hands. But Omalu is not a doctor. He is a scientist, and that's what he is.

In the movie, he focuses on football players and not CTE. And he accepts a lot of blame for not recognizing the problem earlier.

I think his real-life narrative is a bit different.

In real life, Omalu knows about CTE. He has a Ph.D. in pathology. He has seen the brain tissue of a lot of players with CTE, and he knows that the disease has been diagnosed in hundreds of former NFL players.

He told me, "I've seen evidence of CTE in a lot of players. I know it exists."

He said he's not surprised by the number of former players who have died, especially when you consider that football has been around for thousands of years.

"This is a game that's been around since the beginning of time. And it's had almost no changes in its regulations. It's been around for so long, it's such an ingrained part of American culture, it's almost shocking to think that it could have caused this."

I asked Omalu if he knew of any other pathologists who were also diagnosing CTE in football players. The answer was no.

He's not alone.

Dr. Ann McKee, one of the few remaining pathologists who still practices in the U.S., said in an interview:

"I know of one pathologist who is diagnosing CTE in a lot of football players. I know of two or three."

It's also not that uncommon to diagnose CTE in football players. McKee said that in her practice, more than half of all of the brains she's examined are from former football players.

"Think about it: We have a brain bank, and we have to give it to the league every single year to get it tested for CTE. You'd think that all of the football players would have it in their brains. They don't."

There's also a lack of research into CTE. McKee said she's not surprised that there's not much research into CTE, since it's such a difficult disease to study. She said that she's never seen the disease in a living patient.

Rockets on Tuesday agreed to a four-year contract with free agent center Kendrick Perkins, the Houston Chronicle reports.

Perkins will receive a $1.1 million signing bonus, a $1.8 million player option for the 2014-15 season and an option for 2015-16 worth $1.5 million, according to the news outlet.

Perkins, 29, has played exclusively at center for the Rockets since signing a one-year deal with the team in the summer of 2012. He averaged 8.6 points and 5.8 rebounds in his one season with the Rockets.

The 6-foot-10 Perkins was selected by the Nets with the second pick in the 2007 draft. He was waived by Brooklyn on July 16, 2012, and then traded to the Rockets as part of a package for Dwight Howard.

Last season, Perkins averaged 9.4 points and 5.2 rebounds and ranked fourth among Rockets centers in field-goal percentage at 48.5 percent.<|endoftext|>It is not often that you see a gentleman deploy the following line of dialogue: "The Lord blessed the day I was born.

This is a review of the first installment of the Star Wars prequels. It is a review that is based on the general consensus of the community. For those of you who have not seen the prequels, I hope this review will help you make up your mind. For everyone else, I hope you enjoy this review.

STAR WARS PREQUELS: PART 1: A NEW HOPE (2001)

PART 2: THIEF OF THOUSAND PLANETS (2003)

PART 3: REVENGE OF THE SITH (2005)

PART 4: THE FORCE AWAKENS (2015)

The story begins with young Anakin Skywalker. He is a slave to the evil Jabba the Hutt. He has grown up a spoiled rich boy, a spoiled rich boy with a slave name, and now he is about to be sold off to the dark side of the force. He is being sold off to the dark side of the force to become the executioner of an unnamed Jedi Knight.

Before the Jedi Knight can be executed, Master Yoda comes to him with the news that the Jedi are being hunted by the Sith. The Sith have been targeting Jedi for years. The Jedi are being hunted for failing to eliminate the Sith, and Yoda's mission is to find and eliminate the Sith.

The story continues with a Jedi Knight named Ahsoka Tano. She is the daughter of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, who have both been killed by the Sith. She is a Jedi Master, and has been laid to rest in the Jedi Temple.

In order to survive, Ahsoka must go out and find information about the Sith. She is searching for a man named Count Dooku, a man who is wanted by the Jedi for his alleged role in the death of Obi-Wan and Anakin.

The story continues with the young Padawan Ahsoka Tano. This is the first time she has been a Jedi Knight, and her first mission is to find the man she had been assigned to kill: Count Dooku.

The final movie in the prequels, STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES, is the second part to the prequels. It follows Anakin's search for the Sith, attempting to find the vessel that the Dark Lord of the Sith, Count Dooku, has been traveling on.

The story continues with Ahsoka Tano. This is the first time she has been a Jedi Knight, and her first mission is to find the man she had been assigned to kill: Count Dooku.

This is where the story gets really interesting. Ahsoka has been tasked to find a ship that Dooku is traveling on. Her mission is to find a piece of information about the Sith that might lead her to Dooku, and to get there, she must find the ship.

The ship is called the Venator-class Star Destroyer Invisible Hand. It is a ship that is feared and respected by the Jedi, and its mission is to hunt down and destroy the Sith. This is where the story gets really interesting.

This is the first time that you see the ship. It is a Star Destroyer, outfitted with a superweapon. It is the Death Star. It is the most powerful weapon in the entire galaxy, and it is the spacecraft that is being used against the Jedi.

The ship is going to be so powerful that it can not only destroy the Jedi's superweapon, but it can destroy the Jedi themselves. This is what makes the Death Star such a dangerous ship. This is what makes it so powerful.

This question already has an answer here: How do I add text to a txt file? 3 answers

This is a basic question regarding text editing. Text is pretty much made of characters. What is a character? A character is a group of 9 letters and one or more numbers. So a character is a grouping of 3 letters and a number. For example, a character is a group of 3 letters with the first letter a and the second letter b. A character is used in a file to represent any character. For example, the character 'A' is a character. A character is used to represent a character in a file. For example, 'A' is a character in a file.

In this example, the character 'A' is a character.

In this example, the character 'A' is a character.

Here's a fun fact about characters:

A character is never used as a word.

A character is never used as a name.

A character is never used as a number.

A character is never used as a symbol.

In our second episode of The Physics of Star Trek, we interview one of the Star Trek community's leading experts on the physics of the universe, Dr. Jeff Stein from the University of California at Santa Cruz (link here). Jeff has a multi-PhD experience in the area of Star Trek physics, carefully analyzing various episodes of the franchise in the lab and on his blog. In this episode, we discuss the various aspects of Star Trek's physics, including the relevance of the holodeck to the overall physics of the universe, the effects of the time dilatation warp in ST:TNG, and the mystery of how the Enterprise is able to warp so fast.

Jeff, welcome to The Physics of Star Trek! First off, I want to tell you that I'm an extremely big fan of the Star Trek universe and the many different shows, films, and books that have come out of it. I've read all the novels and all the comics, and I've even read the entire original series when it first aired on television! So when I first heard about Star Trek: The Next Generation, I was excited and I was skeptical (and still am). I was also skeptical of the concept of a time dilated warp drive – I knew that warp drive would work only if it was possible to travel at the speed of light. However, I was willing to give Star Trek: The Next Generation a chance, because of the many elements of the show that were intriguing to me, such as the exploration of time travel, the depiction of a multicultural society, and the realistic portrayal of science.

In this episode, we discuss the physics of the universe in Star Trek: The Next Generation, and how the show handles time dilation and the effects of time dilation. We also discuss the mystery of how the Enterprise is able to warp so fast, and how the Starfleet Academy might be the best place for Star Trek students to learn about the physics of the universe.

To learn more about Jeff Stein and his work, check out his website at www.physicsofstarfleet.com.

We also want to thank everyone who has supported us on Patreon, and to all the fans of the show on Twitter and Facebook (links are above).

Finally, if you have any questions or comments, or you just want to leave us a review on iTunes, please don't hesitate to do so (it's a free thing, and the more reviews, the more listeners we get!).

Lastly, if you enjoyed this episode, we'd appreciate it if you'd leave us a review on iTunes (although we'd love it even more if you did!).

As he was wrapping up a lecture, the head of the Department of Anthropology at Harvard University, David Reich, stood up and shouted in his face.

"You cannot talk like that," he said. "You cannot talk in a way that is fully respectful to the women in your class."

A group of women in his class were not impressed. They were not listening. They were not listening because Reich was wrong.

"I have a right to speak," he replied, "and I can ask questions."

It was a case of a professor of anthropology giving a lecture, and in response to a few questions he decided to deliver a lecture on his own.

Reich was not the only one to speak in such a manner. A chorus of male professors across the country have been caught on tape to conduct themselves in a way that is hostile and disrespectful to women.

The problem is not that the men in question were wrong in their beliefs, or that they were wrong in their actions, but that they violated the social norms of the college classroom and university that they had been taught to uphold.

The university's response

Colleges and universities have a responsibility to ensure that the students who attend their classes feel respected and safe.

Student reactions to the recent video of professors at Columbia University lecturing a class on women's issues were mixed.

Stacy Van Houtsen, a senior at Columbia, told the New York Times that the video shocked her and that she found it "disappointing and disappointing that these types of things are still happening."

"This isn't the first time that I have heard of this happening, and it's certainly not the first time that other students have heard of it," she said.

But other students found it to be an unfair attack on free speech.

"I would like to see students and professors have conversations about how they can be better about this, and I think this is a perfect way to start that conversations," said student Jennifer Zevallos.

Zevallos said she was offended by the professor's lecture but was not offended by his "unprofessional" behavior.

"I think it's very important for us to confront these issues," she said.

She said that she would be more than willing to have a conversation about the safety of the campus "to make sure that people feel safe on campus."

In a statement to The Huffington Post, DePaul University, where professor Michael Rectenwald was recently fired for criticizing a student's appearance, said that "the University prohibits 'abusive, hostile, or demeaning conduct' that is 'based upon race, sex, color, national origin, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, marital status or veteran status.'"

DePaul also said that "appropriate action will be taken when faculty members are found to have violated these policies."

DePaul University was not the first college or university to fire a professor for speaking up for women's rights. In 2014, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill fired Professor George Ciccariello-Maher after he tweeted, "All I Want for Christmas is White Genocide."

Ciccariello-Maher went on to make a number of controversial comments in other tweets, including one in which he asked "why does it always have to be about the white guy," and another in which he said that there were "too many people of color in positions of power."

Still, Ciccariello-Maher's actions did not violate the university's policies, and he has been welcomed back into his class.

The professor is not the only professor to have had his class interrupted by angry students.

In 2014, the president of the University of Missouri at Columbia, Tim Wolfe, resigned after students protested his decision to deny tenure to a professor for writing an op-ed article in support of the human rights of transgender students.

In response to the protests, Wolfe apologized, but he also issued a directive to keep safe spaces on campus.

"The most valuable, dynamic, and inclusive educational environment is one in which all members of our community can learn," he said.

The university also announced that it would create a safe space for students who felt threatened by a professor's views.

"I am proud of what we have accomplished in securing the integrity of our faculty and staff," Wolfe said. "We have created a climate of respect and safety for all."

Other universities also put their foot down.

In April, the University of Louisville suspended professor and feminism advocate Wendy McElroy for a year for "unprofessional conduct," after she tweeted a picture of her son, who was born with Down's Syndrome.

"I'm sorry, but I have a right to love my son this way, and I shouldn't be fired for that," McElroy tweeted in response to the university

It's been a few months since we've had a proper makeover of the Gear VR's interface. The changes are very subtle, but they're there. And they're welcome.

First and foremost, you'll notice a new handlebar. That's because the top of the Gear VR is now circular, and not flat like it was before. But, the head tracking is the same as before - it's all just a bit better now.

It's a subtle change, but it's certainly something to take note of. And it's a good reminder that VR isn't just about your eyes.

Here are a few more details you might want to keep in mind when you arrive in VR.

You now have two virtual controllers to use. You can hold them in your hand, or use them like a gamepad.

You can now use the touchpad to navigate the menus. It's got a bit of a delay, but it's there. There's also a 'home' button to get to the home screen.

On the left hand side, you'll find a menu button. You can also use the menu buttons to navigate the menus.

You can now scroll through the menus using your virtual controllers. You can also scroll through the menus using your virtual controllers.

You can now use an app like Google Earth in VR.

You can now use an app like Google Earth in VR.

You can use the menu buttons to access the recently used apps menu.

There are also some other small changes like a new icon for the 'camera' option. If you hold down the trigger button, you can zoom in on the screen.

You can also use the trigger button to launch the camera mode, which allows you to start video recording.

The camera mode is very useful for when you want to record something in VR, but you don't want to make it too obvious.

You can also use the trigger button to launch the controller mode, which allows you to use the pad to interact with the virtual world. The pad does have a bit of lag, but it feels much better than it was.

The menu buttons have been moved to the bottom for a cleaner look. And, the menu buttons now have a different sound, unlike the menu buttons from the Galaxy S4.<|endoftext|>The main problem with the movie is, as Professor Jay Weidner points out in his review, that it's too big. Even if the players are well within their customary roles, the movie is still too big to play on the stage. Given the very limited audience size of 1,180 for the movie, that's a problem. But the biggest problem is this: The movie is almost entirely about the story of a real-life tragedy, and the heroes of the movie are not at all the heroes of the tragedy.

The movie's heroes are the people who were in the wrong (the film's main villains are the police for failing to stop the massacre, but the movie's main heroes are the SWAT officers who were there and who saved the lives of many of the real-life victims). It's a good movie, but the movie should be better if it didn't look at the story of the Newtown school shooting as a story about good, heroic cops and bad, evil bad guys.

The movie is about the tragedy that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012, in Newtown, Connecticut. It's a tragedy that happened almost two years ago and which has inspired a huge amount of anger, sadness, and grief in the country. It was a tragedy that took the lives of 20 young children and seven adults — twenty-six of whom were 6 or 7 years old (the other three were the mother, her boyfriend, and her 6-year-old daughter). It was a tragedy that left the whole country reeling. But it's also a tragedy that provoked a response of grief, anger, and grief in the right places.

The movie is about how the town of Newtown, Connecticut, responded to the tragedy. It was a response that took the form of the community organizing around a new gun-control law. It was a response that put the focus on the parents of the children who were killed — the parents who were first told that their children had been killed by a tragic accident, then told that their children had been killed by their own child. It was a response that put the focus on the educators who were trying to teach the children in the classrooms where the shootings took place. It was a response that put the focus on the teachers who were trying to give the children a safe environment for learning. It was a response that put the focus on the school administrators who tried to find ways to make the school less dangerous for the children. It was a response that put the focus on the parents of the children who were killed, and it was a response that put the focus on the

Alex to the rescue!

It's been a rough couple of weeks for a good friend of mine. My dear friend, Jenna, has been battling stage 4 breast cancer for over two years. She has had two major surgeries and has just had a biopsy to confirm that the cancer is in fact stage 4. It has spread to her bones, and she has experienced some bone marrow metastasis. This is very scary and she is now in the hospital, so I can not be there with her.


This past Saturday, on my way to her house, I had the wonderful opportunity to pick her up from the hospital and take her to a local restaurant for a quick dinner. She wasn't feeling so well, but I wanted to make sure she was well enough to make it to her favorite place. After having a few drinks and some late night eating, we were on our way back to the car when I noticed that Jenna's brown coat was covered in a layer of blood. I ran over, and saw that her right arm was covered in a large, dark red, purple, and black patch. I noticed that the patch was moving along with her arm. I pulled the coat off her arm, and realized that the patch was her left arm. She was bleeding from her forearm. She was rushed to the hospital, and she was listed to have surgery on Sunday.


The next day, I was informed that the surgery would be postponed for a few days. I asked Jenna to hold me as I got in my car to drive back to the hospital. When I got there, I spoke to one of the doctors at the hospital and asked him what was going on. He said that the tumor had grown very fast and had begun to tear Jenna's arm. He said that the blood vessels in her arm were not supplying enough blood to the tumor, and that they were having trouble with her body's ability to heal itself. He said that she would not be able to have surgery on her arm until Monday.


I drove to the hospital and I asked Jenna to hold me as I got in my car. When I got to the hospital, I was informed that her surgery would be postponed until Tuesday. I asked Jenna to hold me while I got in my car. I went inside and told her that I was going to be at the hospital for a while. I said I loved her a lot, and that I was going to be by her side until she was well enough to have surgery. I said that I wanted to hold her hand as she went through the surgery. I was able to hold her hand through the whole procedure, and I was able to hold her hand as she was in the recovery room.


I drove out to the hospital and I went to the surgery room. I asked the doctor that I was going to be there for a while. He said that if I wanted to hold Jenna's hand, that I had to first come to the room to see her. I had to wait a while, and I went in the room. The doctor was there. He was going to give Jenna a shot of morphine, and it was going to be administered in a little bit. He said that if I wanted to hold her hand through the pain, I had to wait for the shot. I told him that it was hard for me to hold her hand while it was going through the pain, and that I just wanted to help her through it. He said that it was my responsibility to do that. I told him that I would do that. I went up to the bed and I held her hand. She was all smiles, and I was able to hold her hand through the pain. She was very happy to see me, and I went and got her a glass of water as she was having a morphine shot. I told her that she was in so much pain, and I could not have done a thing for her. She said that it was okay, but that she could not hold my hand. I said that I would hold her hand. She said that it was okay. I said that she was my friend, and that I would hold her hand. She said that it was okay. I said that my mom was standing there, and that I would hold her hand. She said that it was okay. I said that I didn't know her mom, but that she was my best friend, and that she would hold my hand. She said that it was okay, and that I would hold her hand. She said that she loved me, and that she was all I had. I said that I was her best friend, and that I would hold her hand. She said that it was okay, and that she loved me too. I told her that she was my best friend, and that I loved her too. I smiled at her, and I held her hand. She told me that I was her best friend, and that I loved her too. I said that I was her best friend, and that I

An article published by the Telegraph on Monday, July 1, outlines the latest findings from the Association for Psychological Science's survey of more than 10,000 Americans, which shows that women are not only the primary caregivers for their children, but they also make up nearly half of child-care providers.

The article, which is titled "The Gender Divide in Child Care," examines trends in female child care and explores the reasons why women are more likely to be caregivers than men. The most recent findings show that the majority of Americans (53.6 percent) say that fathers are at least as important as mothers when it comes to child care. This percentage is up from 51.1 percent in 2011, and an even higher percentage of women (65.3 percent) say that fathers are as important as mothers when it comes to child care.

Women continue to be more likely than men to be child care providers (56.3 percent to 54.2 percent). However, men continue to be the primary caregivers for their children (92.7 percent to 89.9 percent).

"This is a huge change," said Mary C. Curtis, PhD, a psychologist at the University of Notre Dame and a co-author of the study. "Women have been at the forefront of this movement for decades. There are lots of surveys that show that women are more involved in child care than men are. This study is a good reminder that that's not always the case. Women are at the forefront of this and we're going to need to continue to engage them in this work."

Women are also more likely to be employed than men are: 28 percent of women are child care providers, compared to 24.8 percent of men. Women are also more likely than men to be employed full-time in child care (69.6 percent of women compared to 57.6 percent of men) and less likely to be employed part-time (17.5 percent of women compared to 27.9 percent of men).

Curtis and her co-authors suggest that this is due to the fact that women have greater work demands and also have more family responsibilities, which makes it more difficult for them to leave work to take care of their children.

"It's probably because women are still expected to work and have families," Curtis said. "It's a stereotype that men can do anything."

The authors also believe that there are many reasons why men are more likely to be child care providers than women. Many child care providers say that men tend to be more of a "team player" than women are, and more interested in helping their child care providers feel comfortable and confident.

"That's not true of women," Curtis said. "Women are more likely to be the 'shy one.'"

The report also shows that women are more likely than men to be employed full time in child care. Some women may choose to work part-time and still care for their children, while others may not be willing to sacrifice their career in order to care for their children.

"We know that women are making choices about their careers that are more flexible and not necessarily going to require them to work full-time," Curtis said. "Part of it is that they have more family responsibilities, so they may have more flexibility in their work schedules. That may be the case for women who are full-time workers; it may not be the case for women who are part-time workers."

The authors found that men are more likely to be employed part-time in child care (48.9 percent compared to 39.4 percent). However, women are more likely than men to be employed full-time in child care (84.2 percent compared to 67.5 percent).

"I think it's a matter of women not really having the same work expectations as men," Curtis said. "They're more likely to think, 'I can do that.' They're not going to have as much of a hard-and-fast rule that they have to be home every day."

The authors also believe that more women (38.8 percent) have made the decision to leave full-time work for child care, compared to men (30.3 percent).

"It's interesting that women are making the decision to leave full-time work," Curtis said. "It's a pretty big jump. I think it's more of a choice that they're making to allow their children to be able to get a better education and have a better life."

The findings also show that women are more likely than men to be employed in part-time jobs (29.6 percent compared to 25.7 percent), and are more likely to have some type of disability (25.1 percent compared to 17.6 percent).

"Women are more likely to have some type of disability," Curtis said. "I think that's why many of them are working part-time."

Cheryl Shuman has been a teacher in the Des Moines Public Schools for 30 years.

She is the only teacher in the district who is a certified diabetes educator, and she has been for more than 20 years.

The Iowa Board of Education is expected to vote on whether to allow diabetes educators to practice in public schools on Wednesday.

"That's a huge step," Shuman said. "I am thrilled that this is getting so much attention."

Shuman, who is also a registered nurse, also is diabetic. She's been treated for type 1 diabetes since she was 7.

"It's an interesting twist," she said. "I didn't anticipate that this would be such a big deal."

Shuman said she has been in touch with teachers at two of her middle schools who are planning to ask their schools to allow diabetes educators to teach in their classrooms.

Shuman said she believes public school health teachers should have the same training as other nurses.

"When you're a diabetes educator in the school system, you're there to serve a whole population," she said.

Pediatrician Samuel A. Stebbins, M.D., who was appointed by Gov. Terry Branstad to lead the Iowa Department of Human Services' diabetes task force, said he's not opposed to diabetes educators teaching in public school classrooms.

"It's not a new idea," Stebbins said. "There are many people who have been doing that for quite some time now, including a number of individuals, including myself."

The Iowa Board of Education is expected to vote on whether to allow diabetes educators to teach in public schools on Wednesday.

"I think the board is being very thoughtful and very deliberate about this," Shuman said. "The goal is not to open the door to teaching in the school system. It's to ensure that people have access to the education they need."

The latest news from our perspective of the Trump presidency is that the president has announced his intention to fire special counsel Robert Mueller.

It has not been a good morning for the president. He had an uncharacteristically quiet first hour, his first meeting of the day with the Pope and then the White House said he had been told that the president would fire Mueller.

As a result, the president is now embroiled in an intense 24-hour period of defending his decision to fire the special counsel.

As the president's legal team now prepares to launch its defense, it is worth noting that the president's firing of Mueller has been the subject of a long-running investigation by the Justice Department's Inspector General.

The most recent report of that investigation was issued on May 23, and it concluded that the dismissal of Mueller was "not appropriate." That report, which was written by the former chief of the Criminal Division's criminal fraud section, also said that Mueller's investigation of alleged ties between Trump associates and Russian officials has been "exceptionally broad" and that the attorney general's decision not to recuse himself from the matter was "not justified."

The report concluded that "the Department of Justice and the FBI have not developed sufficient evidence to support a determination that any crimes were committed or that any reasonable prosecutor would bring."

In a letter to the Inspector General in May, Trump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said that the president was not aware that Mueller would be conducting the investigation. Kasowitz asked the Inspector General to look into the matter again because "the Department of Justice's own investigation into the matter has not revealed any facts whatsoever indicating that the President was under investigation."

Kasowitz is correct. But as The Washington Post's Peter Nicholas and Tom Hamburger noted in a recent story, the IG's report revealed that Mueller's investigation included interviewing former FBI Director James B. Comey, who was abruptly fired by Trump in May, and his aides. The IG's report also disclosed that Mueller was raising concerns internally about Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation.

The IG's report also revealed that Mueller had hired several lawyers who were also former FBI officials and that he was likely to interview current and former FBI agents who worked on the Clinton investigation.

The IG's report also contained evidence that Mueller had assigned a number of his investigators to work on the Russia investigation, despite his pledge to leave it alone.

A number of the investigators Mueller had hired "have backgrounds that raise concerns for us," the IG's report said. "In addition, many of the investigators have significant experience investigating matters related to President George W. Bush, including some who worked on the investigation into President Bush's re-election campaign (including a case of alleged misconduct by former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card)."

Further, the report said that Mueller had "identified more cases in which he believes FBI agents may have violated the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority for partisan political purposes, than we could identify."

The IG's report was issued after the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) found that Mueller's staff had engaged in "inappropriate communications" with the FBI's top official in the bureau, James A. Baker III.

The OPR's report also found that Mueller's staff had engaged in "inappropriate communications" with the House Intelligence Committee, although it did not say whether such communications were related to the Russia investigation.

But the OPR report also found that Mueller's staff had also improperly contacted the FBI's general counsel and the FBI's deputy general counsel about political matters unrelated to the Russia investigation.

The IG's report said that "the FBI's senior leadership and prosecutors have taken steps to correct the deficiencies identified by the Office of Professional Responsibility."

It added that the FBI "considered the recommendations and took the necessary and appropriate action to address these issues."

Mueller's former deputy, Andrew Weissmann, resigned the same week that the OPR report was issued. He had been Mueller's chief of staff.

In addition to the OPR report, The Post reported in late May that Mueller had written a memo to FBI officials that said he did not want Comey's assistance in investigating Flynn.

The report, which was issued May 23, was written by Mueller's former chief of staff, FBI veteran Peter Strzok. Strzok played a prominent role in the FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private server as secretary of state.

The Post reported that Strzok's role in the Clinton investigation had raised concerns among other FBI officials.

The Mueller memo cited two instances of what he described as "inappropriate partisan political activity" by Strzok. One was an interview that he conducted with a senior Democratic operative, whose name is redacted in the memo.

The second was an interview with a senior Justice Department official, whose name is also redacted.

I've been using the i3/Xfce4/MATE desktop environments for a few years now. It's probably one of the most versatile environments for a desktop, without the need to resort to a terminal.

However, I've recently moved to a different desktop environment, which I prefer to i3. I've been using the new GNOME 3.10 desktop for a few weeks and I think that it is a great environment for me. I'm going to share my thoughts on it, and why I think it's better.

What's GNOME?

GNOME is a new desktop environment that a lot of people are loving. It's designed to be lightweight and minimalistic, so that you can get to work without having to learn any new terminal commands.

GNOME 3.10 is based on GNOME 3 and uses GNOME Shell, a modern, highly customizable, and customizable shell. You can add new themes, create your own themes, and even change the default backlight.

Here are some features of GNOME Shell:

The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Monday upheld a state law that imposes a $500 fine, up to 20 days in jail and a lifetime ban from teaching in public schools for those who teach creationism in public school science classes.

The law was passed in 2011. The court's decision means the law can't be appealed.

"We feel that this law reflects the will of the people," said attorney Mike Phillips, who represented the state.

The law was challenged by the Oklahoma Association of School Boards. It said the law is unconstitutional because it violates the separation of church and state and violates the First Amendment's prohibition on the establishment of religion.

The law was passed in 2011 and was the state's first attempt at a creationism law. The Legislature passed the bill in response to the state being ranked near the bottom of states in science by the National Science Foundation.

Supporters of the law said it was necessary to teach students about evolution and other scientific theories. Opponents claimed it was unconstitutional because it singled out creationism for punishment.

The Oklahoma law calls for a fine of up to $500 for teachers who teach creationism in science classes. The state has said that means no teacher could be hired who taught creationism.

The state's highest court cited a report by the National Academy of Sciences that said creationism is a religious belief and that it is a violation of the First Amendment to teach creationism in public schools.

The National Academy of Sciences report said creationism is a belief that the Earth was created by God, and that life on Earth is described in Genesis as a result of this creative act.

The court said the law was a reasonable restriction on the teaching of creationism because it sought to balance the theory of evolution with creationism and did not target one religion over another.

"Creationism is not a legitimate scientific theory," the court said. "Creationism is a religious belief, but it is one that has been rejected by most scientists, rejected by many other scientists, and rejected by the United States Congress."

Phillips said the law was passed after a period of public debate and that the school boards were powerless to override the law and reinstate the teacher who was forced to resign.

"The reality of the law is that the Oklahoma Legislature decided to punish teachers who teach creationism," Phillips said. "They decided to punish teachers who taught the theory of evolution. They decided to punish teachers who teach climate change. They decided to punish teachers who teach other theories."

Oklahoma has about 1,700 public school teachers.<|endoftext|>The US National Security Agency (NSA) has not been able to penetrate the UK's GCHQ internet surveillance system, according to documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

According to Der Spiegel, the NSA has "proved" that it cannot break the security of its UK counterpart, but has been unable to trace the targets of its eavesdropping.

The NSA does not have the means to systematically monitor the internet activities of GCHQ staff, according to Der Spiegel.

The documents reveal that the agency has been unable to crack a number of encryption schemes used by GCHQ staff.

The agency is also unable to intercept the data that "harmful" internet traffic is sending to or from the UK, the documents show.

GCHQ, the UK's equivalent to the NSA, has been in the spotlight recently after it was reported that the agency has been working with US firms to help it crack the encryption used on the internet.

It is understood that the agency has been able to break some encryption schemes that were being used by the major technology companies.

GCHQ has been criticised for its role in the Prism surveillance programme, which has been revealed by the Guardian newspaper.

The NSA and GCHQ have denied giving the US companies access to their overseas operations.

The photographs obtained by Der Spiegel show GCHQ staff working on an internet surveillance programme called Tempora.

The documents show that the UK agency said it is not able to break encryption used by the internet giants.

GCHQ said the agency is also investigating the use of encryption by mobile phone operators, but it has so far not been able to crack them.

The documents also reveal that GCHQ has been monitoring the communications of Russian President Vladimir Putin for the past four years.

The files also reveal that GCHQ's job is not finished: the agency intends to carry out "a systematic strategic communications-collection operation against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria [Isis] starting in the spring".

The documents suggest that GCHQ is planning to employ men who have "expertise in the use of encryption" to eavesdrop on Isis communications.<|endoftext|>The news that the men's and women's 800-meter races in the Rio Olympics have been changed to a men's vs. women's final, as opposed to the previous practice of a men's final and a women's semifinal

Former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan has been awarded $140 million in his lawsuit against Gawker Media after the media company published a sex tape of the former pro wrestler.

Hogan sued Gawker after the website published a sex tape featuring the former professional wrestler and his friend, radio shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge Clem.

Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, had promised to turn the tape over to police if Gawker didn't pay him an unspecified amount. The tape, which Gawker published in 2012, shows Hogan having sex with Clem.

Gawker argued that its publication was protected by the First Amendment because the sex was between consenting adults, that Hogan didn't give his consent to the tape's publication and that the tape was newsworthy.

In a statement, Gawker said its decision to publish the sex tape was not intended to humiliate Hogan and that the company had "no interest" in paying him.

The award was announced on Thursday in a St. Petersburg, Florida, federal court, according to The Associated Press.

Gawker's lawyers had asked for $100 million in damages from Hogan, while Gawker's attorneys asked for $25 million.

"We're delighted that the court has recognized that publishing the sex tape was speech protected by the First Amendment," Hogan's attorney, Jeffrey Kessler, said in a statement. "We're looking forward to getting on with the case and having the case decided on the merits."

"I would love to have a third debate, absolutely. I would love to. It's in the interest of all of us, because it's interesting," Mr Trump told reporters on board his plane as he left for a trip to Ohio on Wednesday.

"The other day, I was saying, you know, one of the great things about the debates is they're on live television. There's no sound effects and you can actually listen," he said.

"And the other day, I was watching the debate and I was talking to one of the anchors, and I said, 'How's the sound? How's the sound?' And she said, 'Oh, it's really good.'"

Mr Trump said Mr Clinton had been "very good" at the first two debates, but that she was "very bad" at the third.

"She was very bad. She was very bad. She was very bad. She was very bad," Mr Trump said.

"The second debate was like a 70-30 split. She was very bad. In the third debate, she was way worse than the first one and I said, 'I don't think she can win.'"

In contrast, Ms Clinton "didn't do that bad", he added.

Ms Clinton has won the first two debates, which were held in Hempstead, New York, and in Las Vegas.

The third debate is scheduled for North Las Vegas, Nevada, on 9 October, the same night as the first debate.

Mr Trump continued to accuse Ms Clinton of being in the pocket of Wall Street, saying she was "getting away with murder" on the campaign trail.

"The system is rigged. It's rigged," he said.

So far, the most effective drugs for treating HIV-1 are AZT and protease inhibitors, but researchers are working to develop better drugs that can treat other retroviruses.

"Why is there such imbalances in the effectiveness of these drugs? It's pretty surprising," says lead author Paul A. Young, Ph.D., from the University of Washington. "In the case of HIV-1, AZT is the most effective, followed by protease inhibitors and then dolutegravir. What we're finding is that the drugs that are effective against HIV-1 are very different from those that are effective against other viruses."

In the current paper, Young and his colleagues examined the effectiveness of eight HIV-1-specific drugs against seven other retroviruses: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1), human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-II), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV

The park's opening dates have been announced, and The Disney Parks Blog has revealed that the opening of the new ice rink in Epcot's World Showcase will happen on July 14.

But the movie's latest attraction, The Incredibles, is not coming to the park.

The WDW News Today blog reports that the movie will not be part of the Frozen Ever After attraction that opened in late March.

That attraction is part of a larger Frozen celebration at the park that includes an ice skating parade, a sing-along of "Let It Go," and a fireworks show.

The Incredibles will be part of a separate Frozen Ever After event that will also include a meet-and-greet with the movie's actors, and a rare appearance by Anna and Elsa.

The Incredibles is based on a popular animated series, and the movie's director is Brad Bird.

Solomon had had enough of the riches of the Premier League and wanted to play in Serie A. A move to the Italian top flight was meant to be his shot at finally fulfilling his dream of one day representing his country.

The move never materialised but it was not the end of the world as Palmerston North-based Solomon is now a prominent member of the Napoli team.

The 30 year-old has been in and out of the side for the past few seasons but has been rewarded with senior caps for the Azzurri over the last two years.

Solomon was left out of Napoli's squad for their trip to Genoa but has made a firm return and will be hoping to establish himself in the side.

We spoke to Solomon about his move to Napoli, his move to Palmerston North, his support network, and why he thinks he'll be the next Nani.

Off Track: You left Napoli to come to Napoli. What was the reasoning behind that?

Danny Solomon: I wanted to play in Italy. I knew that if I was to come to Napoli I would have to play in Serie A. The problem was that I knew that even though they were a big club, they didn't have the resources to pay for me.

Off Track: How did you convince them?

DS: It was easy. I never had any problems with the club. I never had any problems with the coach. I was never on the bench. I was always in the team. The only problem was that I knew that I couldn't play in Serie A.

I have spoken to the president of the club and obviously he understood. I got an e-mail from him saying that he understood what I was going through.

Off Track: You came here to Napoli without any money. How did you come up with the money?

DS: I'm not coming up with the money. I'm going to the club that has the best chance of paying me what I'm worth. The problem was that I couldn't find a club in Italy where I would be happy to play. I had no problem with the club and I didn't want to leave Napoli.

Off Track: Is there a team in Italy that you would have liked to play for?

DS: I didn't ask. I just wanted to play in Italy. I had never played in Italy before, I had never played in Serie A or any of the Italian leagues.

Off Track: What do you think will be the key to your success in Serie A?

DS: The key to my success in Italy is going to be my pitch awareness. I think that coming to Napoli and being able to play on a pitch that I know and that I know the pitches of, is going to be the key to my success.

Off Track: So having played in the Premier League and not playing in Italy has been a big learning curve?

DS: I think so. I'm not coming here to play in Serie A. I'm coming here to play in Serie A.

Off Track: Are you confident?

The U.S. government has not issued a statement on the latest developments in the shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.

Attorney General Eric Holder said Sunday on "Meet The Press" that he would wait until he received a full report from the Justice Department.

Holder said the investigation was "ongoing," and that the Justice Department would be reviewing the shooting.

"It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the details of an ongoing investigation," Holder said. "What is indisputable is that I have been briefed on the facts of the case. And I'm reasonably confident that we'll have a full report by the time we are through, and that investigation will be concluded as quickly as possible."

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said Monday that the officer has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure. He said the police department would not discuss the officer's identity or any other aspect of the investigation.

Jackson said that the officer was not wearing a body camera and that he is not aware of any video that has surfaced.

Meanwhile, a group of at least a dozen protesters gathering outside the Ferguson police department on Monday were joined by the Rev. Al Sharpton and a few other community leaders.

"It's clear that the police chief is not doing his job," Sharpton said in a statement. "I'm going to go to Ferguson, Missouri, to tell the truth about what happened to Michael Brown and other unarmed people of color. Not in the name of a protest, but in the name of justice."

The shooting of Brown, 18, has sparked protests across the St. Louis area and has sparked a national conversation about the use of force by law enforcement and the treatment of minorities by police.

KMOV.com reports that he was walking in a middle of the street with his hands up when the officer shot him.

The officer has been put on administrative leave.

The set cost me 5 hours to make and cost me about 100 bucks. It is made out of acrylic and wood and includes a chess board, chess pieces and a chess clock. The chess board is about 6 feet across and is made from 1/4 inch thick plywood. I cut the chess pieces from 1/4 inch thick plywood. The chess clock is made from a large piece of plywood, shaped with a router. The pieces were carefully sanded with 400 grit sandpaper and were then painted with acrylic spray paint. The clock is about 3 feet tall and is about 12 inches wide at the front. I wanted the clock to be slightly longer for me to use it as a coffee table so it is about 12 inches wide. The clock measures 6 feet tall and is about 18 inches wide at the back. It is about 12 feet long and is made from 2x4's. The clock has two pizza pans on the front and one on the back. It has two large speakers on the front and one on the back. It has a control panel on the back. The control panel is made out of wood and the buttons are shaped like chess pieces. It has a large button on the front that is shaped like a pawn. It has a small button on the back that

I guess I should have done it sooner, but I just felt like I wanted to get the whole exercise out of the way. In my defense, I sat on the list for a long time, so it didn't take that long for the list to get to me.

It's probably a good thing I kept going back through all the posts and pages because I ended up learning a lot more about the literary and cultural history of the American West than I thought I would.

I'll admit that I'm not as familiar with the literary history of the West as I would like to be. I'm partial to the classics, and I'm not sure that I've read almost any of the works of modern Western literature.

I don't think it has anything to do with my personality. I've read a lot of books about others, and I've read even more about myself, and I'm not particularly shy or retiring.

What it has to do with is that I'm a bit of a dry scholar when it comes to Western literature, and I've written about a few things that I'm not terribly knowledgeable about at all.

So here's my list of "the best of" Western literature, from the best to the worst.

The Best

The Grapes of Wrath (1939)

I don't know who the hell this guy is, and I don't care. But I already mentioned that I have a bit of a soft spot for the classics. There's a reason for that, and I'll get to that in a moment, but first let's just say that the movie was brilliant.

I don't know how much of it was accurate, but I will say that it was very, very accurate. In fact, I think it was the most accurate movie ever made about the American West.

Most of what I've read about the West is pretty biased, and it's always been like that. The American West is just an area of the country where you can find a few crazies who think they're better than everyone else, and it's a great place to find people who are stupid enough to believe that the most important thing in the world is their own existence.

That's what this movie has in common with an earlier movie that was even more accurate about the American West.

The Last of the Mohicans (1992)

I don't have much of an attachment to this movie. It turns out that I'm not a huge fan of The Last of the Mohicans books. I don't think they

In a bid to lose weight, adults who consume more than the recommended daily amount of sugar each day may have to cut back on other foods that are good for you.

The study, published in the journal Obesity, found that children who consumed more added sugar during their first two years of life were more likely to become obese later in life.

The researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the University of Oklahoma School of Public Health, conducted a study on 5,006 children, aged five to 15, of Mexican origin.

They found that when children were given an increased amount of added sugar in their first two years of life, they were more likely to become obese as they aged, and that sugar-sweetened beverages were the main culprit.

"Children who were exposed to increased amounts of sugar in the first two years of life were significantly more likely to become obese as they aged and were more likely to consume more added sugar as they aged," said lead researcher Dr. Catherine St. Pierre.

"Children who consumed more sugar in the first two years of life were also more likely to consume more sugar-sweetened beverages as they aged, which are associated with increased body weight, and were more likely to report a poor appetite and to be less active," Dr. St. Pierre said in a press release.

Children who consumed more added sugar in their first two years of life are more likely to become obese as they age.

The researchers also found that children who consumed more sugar were more likely to report a poor appetite, and were less likely to be active in the first year and more likely to report eating less frequently and less healthfully in the second year.

The researchers found that children who consumed more added sugar in the first two years of life were more likely to become obese as they aged, and were more likely to consume more sugar-sweetened beverages as they aged.

Children who consumed more added sugar in the first two years of life were more likely to consume more sugar-sweetened beverages as they aged.

"Increased exposure of children to added sugar in the first two years of life may be associated with a greater risk for obesity in later life," Dr. St. Pierre said.

"Our study suggests that a parent's increased intake of added sugar in the first two years of life is associated with an increased risk for overweight and obesity in the child," Dr. St. Pierre said.

"We recommend that pediatricians and other health care professionals screen all children for exposure to added sugar in the first two years of life," Dr. St. Pierre said.

About 10 or 15 percent of children in the U.S. are obese.

"Heavy exposure to added sugar in the first two years of life may have long-term consequences on the development of the child," said Dr. St. Pierre in the release.

The research was conducted on a group of twins, one of which had a genetic predisposition to melanoma. He was able to detect a difference in skin sensitivity to sunlight after just 24 hours of exposure.

The study, published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, confirmed that the skin of the twin with the genetic predisposition to melanoma responds to the power of the sun even after just 24 hours.

As a result, the researchers found that the skin of the twin with the genetic predisposition to melanoma was much more sensitive to UV radiation.

Researchers believe that the skin sensitivity of the twin with the genetic predisposition to melanoma may be related to a mutation in the gene that controls melanoma.

The researchers believe that the mutation may have resulted in a more rapid rate of melanoma cell growth.

The study also found that the twin with the genetic predisposition to melanoma developed a higher number of squamous cell carcinomas than his twin brother.

Because of the genetic predisposition to melanoma, the researchers say that any type of sun exposure should be avoided.

The study was funded by the Australian Research Council, the National Health and Medical Research Council,

Dr. E.J. Dix, a pediatric neurosurgeon at the University of California, Irvine, believes that the "pit" that separated children from their parents during the Civil War may not have been the result of the Civil War, but instead a result of a measles epidemic in the 1860s.

Dix made the claim during a panel discussion at the 2013 International Conference on Autism at UCI Wednesday, according to the conference's website. The panel discussion was titled: "Children in Civil War Times: Diversifying the Perspective of Pain and Loss."

"In the 1860s, measles was known to be a serious disease, and it was believed that children could be made immune to measles by the immunizations that were being administered," Dix explained, according to the website. "It was thought that if you inoculated an infant, the child would be protected from measles, but that was not the case."

Dix also said that many of the children who died during the Civil War were "intentionally killed" because they were inoculated against measles before they were born.

"Children from infants to preschoolers were vaccinated, and [the] measles was eradicated in the U.S.," Dix said, according to the website. "But, the same vaccines were also used for measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and polio."

Dix said that he believes that many of the children who died during the Civil War died from measles because of the lack of immunity to the disease.

"I believe that many of the children who died in the Civil War were intentionally killed," Dix said. "In the 1860s, there was no vaccine for measles. It was believed that children could be protected, and that's probably why they died."<|endoftext|>RALEIGH, N.C. — The city of Raleigh said Wednesday that it has been hosting a "Free the Norks" rally since September and that more than 100 people have already participated.

The rally, dubbed "Free the Norks," is scheduled to take place on Saturday, as the city tries to decide whether to approve a law that would allow stores to sell alcohol during non-business hours.

"Free the Norks" will be held from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. at the Raleigh City Hall, located at 11 East Main Street.

Admission is free and open to the public.

The rally is being organized by Raleigh Citizen Action Group.

The group, which is trying to pass a law that allows alcohol sales in North Carolina's "live music districts," is asking the public to attend the rally.

The group has said it will hold a "Free the Norks" rally every Saturday throughout the month of October.

"Our goal is to show the people of Raleigh how much support there is for our cause, and that we are not a fringe movement," said Daniel McCall, founder of Raleigh Citizen Action Group.

"This is not an anti-establishment movement. This is an anti-establishment movement that is about the people."

The Friday before the rally, the group is asking everyone to stop by Raleigh City Hall in uniform and to show their support.<|endoftext|>This is a very simple and straight forward tutorial to learn how to create a 1:1 scale model of a Hyperion from the game Destiny. I've created this tutorial with the help of the Destiny wiki and the Destiny in-game help. "Hyperion" is the name given to the class of Titan. I am using the Hyperion in the Destiny 2 beta to try out the Hellfire Assault and the Jackal. You can download the completed file here.

Step 1 – Start with a 1:1 scale model

The first step in creating a 1:1 scale model of a Hyperion is to create a 1:1 scale model. This means that you have to scale down the 1:1 model to 1:1 scale.

1. Create a new model

This is where the bulk of the work is done. First, we need to create a new model in 3ds Max. The first thing we need to do is select the model in the viewport and then go to the "Export to Mesh" tab.

2. Export to Polygons

Next, we need to export the model to Polygons. This is a simple process. First, we need to select the model in the viewport and then go to the "Export to Mesh" tab.

3. Export to Layers

Now that we have our Polygons, we want to use the Layers tab to export the model to 3ds Max.

4. Export to Polygons

This is where we do the actual converting. This is where we convert our Polygons into 3ds Max Mesh. We have to click on "Create Layers"

The world's most popular currency is failing to live up to its promise, in large part because it's being held by a small, well-organized cadre of criminals and libertarians.

The KuCoin (kuchu) digital currency, which is backed by a range of commodities, is trading at about 5,000 satoshis ($47) per coin, a loss of about $200 in value in the past week alone, according to a cryptocurrency tracker.

That compares with a record high of over 8,000 satoshis per coin in October.

The reason for the rise is simple: the price of bitcoin is rising, and so is the value of KuCoin.

KuCoin is a platform that connects buyers and sellers of commodities with each other. The idea is to facilitate cross-border trade.

The currency is backed by gold, silver, platinum and palladium, as well as a number of other metals, and operates on a "per-unit-weight" basis. That means that the price of a certain metal, for example, is used in calculating the price of a certain commodity.

The currency, which is currently traded on the Chinese e-commerce site Taobao, is largely used by gold and silver buyers, although it can also be used by anyone buying and selling any commodity.

The currency is bought and sold on the platform in Chinese yuan, which it says is backed by 7.8 billion ounces of gold.

"We believe our basic structure makes it more stable than other coins in the market," said a spokesperson for KuCoin. "KuCoin is an efficient system for trading, no matter what the commodity."

The spokesperson declined to provide further comment.

The currency is also being used to buy and sell properties in China, such as apartments in Sichuan province.

KuCoin's founder, a Chinese businessman surnamed Ho, said that he was not aware of any links between the currency and criminal activity, but said that there is no question that he is aware of the traffic.

"I am not a criminal, I am a businessman," Ho said. "I don't do illegal things, so I don't have to be careful. It is only the news."

KuCoin was launched in April 2014, after being described by TechCrunch at the time as "the gold standard in e-commerce".

It has already been mentioned in the Panama Papers, leaked documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca that revealed the wealth of international politicians, celebrities and sports stars.

The currency has also been used to buy and sell Twitter shares and Facebook shares.

"We have seen a significant increase in our daily trading volume over the past 24 hours," said a KuCoin spokesperson. "This is mostly due to the increased speculation in the bitcoin market."

The currency was launched in the US, with a low of 50 satoshis per coin in April 2015. Since then, the value has risen to more than 6,000 satoshis per coin.

But the currency is not without its critics.

Jeffrey Tucker, an American libertarian economist and activist, argues that it is not a cryptocurrency, but rather just a commodity-backed currency.

"It's not a currency because there is no intrinsic value — there is no gold or silver in it," he told the Guardian. "It's a commodity, it's an insurance product, and it's a system for buying and selling commodities."

He said that the currency should be treated like bonds, and not an investment.

"The problem with bitcoin is that it is not a currency. It's a commodity thing," he said.

"And what is wrong with a commodity thing? It's a good thing, it keeps money safe, it's a store of value, it's a way of handling money."

He has previously argued that bitcoin could be a vehicle for black market money laundering.

Other critics have questioned the use of the currency in China.

"The government is totally behind this. They are totally behind this. They are behind every innovation in China," said Barry Silbert, founder of SecondMarket, who told the Guardian that he was not aware of any exchange in China that buys and sells bitcoin. "They are totally behind bitcoin, except for the fact that it's not a legal tender there."

Silbert said bitcoin was not a currency, but rather a commodity.

"It's not as good as gold or silver, and it's not as good as U.S. dollars. And it's certainly not a store of value, because it's volatile in value," he said.

"But it is not illegal in China because it's not a currency. So it's not illegal. It's not even illegal in the United States. The problem is, it's not a currency in any place, so

A bunch of people got together to talk about the new, and old, Star Wars games and what they mean to the franchise. I was lucky enough to be one of them, and this is my first Star Wars game review.

Star Wars: Battlefront II is the first Star Wars game I've played since the original. I haven't been able to play the original Battlefront since it was released in 2014, so I've been hating on EA and DICE ever since I heard about no-CD-only Star Wars Battlefront II. But, I was lucky enough to get a copy of the game, and I've been playing it ever since.

The second Star Wars game to be released in a couple of years, Star Wars: Battlefront II is a direct sequel to Battlefront. The concept is pretty much the same, so if you are excited to play the first Star Wars game in a while, this is the game to get.

The gameplay is pretty much identical to the original Battlefront. You start off in a small base with a few squads of troopers, and your goal is to take out the enemy base and kill the enemy commander. You will be able to take out bases that are guarded by AT-STs, as well as other small units. The base you start on will be your home base for the rest of your time in the game.

The game is a lot of fun. The first time I played the game, I played it on the hardest difficulty setting (which is called Hardened) and it was so much fun. I was able to run around the map with my squadmates, blasting the enemy and attacking bases. It really felt like you were in a Star Wars film.

The story and story mode is a lot of fun to play through. You can play through the main story mode in two or three hours. The story mode is quite long, but it is fun. I finished the main story in about two hours. I spent most of my time in the multiplayer mode.

The game does a good job of bringing back the Star Wars universe, and it feels like a very Star Wars game. There is a lot to do in the multiplayer mode. It's a lot of fun, and it takes quite a bit of time to get through the multiplayer experience. I usually spend about two hours playing multiplayer, and it can get quite boring. The game is very easy to pick up, but the gameplay is quite difficult to get into.

The game is the most fun I've had in a Star Wars game since the original. It's a nice return to a place, and a lot of fun to play. My only complaint is that I don't think this game will be able to attract a new audience. I'm not sure if it will be a big hit with the core Star Wars fans, but the casual fans will definitely find it fun.

The dog's face is bewitched by the discerning eye of a child. Its eyes are wide and its ears are erect. It has a curious, inquisitive look on its face, and its fur sticks up and out like a piece of a puzzle.

On the face of a dog, the eyes are almost always beautiful. When you put your hand in a dog's face and touch its eyes, your hand will generally move away from your body. The dog's eyes are often large, and they convey an emotion that is overlooked by the rest of the dog's expression.

The eyes are a great way of communicating emotion and feeling to other dogs.

The eyes of a dog convey realistic, human emotions, and are therefore a great way of communicating emotion and feeling to other dogs.

The U.S. military is not looking at a nuclear-armed North Korea as a "serious threat" that requires immediate action, a top military official said Thursday.

"I don't see a military option as being part of this," said Adm. Cecil Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, during a conference in Washington, D.C.

"I think we're getting to the point in this region where you need something that's a little more credible, that's a little more credible than a nuclear weapon," Haney said, according to Navy Times. "I haven't seen a military option that I would support."

North Korea is expected to conduct a sixth nuclear test — possibly Friday — prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to tweet Wednesday that the North Korean regime was "begging for war."

But Haney said he felt the threat was "minor" and that the U.S. would "definitely defend itself."

North Korea conducted a fifth nuclear test in January.

The North Korean regime has previously threatened to destroy the United States and has also tested missiles capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.<|endoftext|>The most common way to go about getting your wife to sleep with you is to tell her that you are playing with her, and then one day she will come to you and ask for sex.

She will probably ask to be brought into the scene, but the fact that she will be there will make her more comfortable.

You will tell her how much she is hurting you and how much she is enjoying the sex, and then she will make a comment about how it must hurt to be that close to me.

But she is too shy to tell you what she is thinking, so you will have to continue playing with her.

The hardest part is convincing her that you are not going to leave. If you are the only one there, she will have to keep playing with you for a while, and she will be very upset. Then she will feel unsafe and go home.

OTTAWA -- The Canadian military says it has launched a review of its screening process for Afghan recruits, after a Canadian soldier was killed in Afghanistan.

The Department of National Defence says a thorough investigation is taking place into the circumstances surrounding the death of Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, who was killed in the Kandahar province of Afghanistan on Sunday.

It says it will be looking at the policy and procedures in place to ensure it's being followed.

Vincent's family has asked for privacy and they will not be making a statement at this time.

The military says the review will take place in the coming days.<|endoftext|>You haven't added any 3D printed products yet.

Owl is a bold new way to experience live music. Using your smartphone, you're able to watch, listen, and even dance to your favorite artists. In the past, watching live music was a complex and time-consuming process, but Owl gives you the ability to enjoy live music without the distraction of a flaky internet connection.


For the first time ever, you can watch and listen to live music from your smartphone in a secure, private, and awe-inspiring environment.<|endoftext|>The "rubber tubes" that have replaced traditional hand-held amplifiers are not only the fastest and most efficient way to power up to 10 times their original power, but they are also the most colorful and dynamic. This is no small feat, and it's really great to see examples of this kind of creativity and engineering in the world of audio.

The "Chariot" is a 10-channel amplifier that uses a custom-built 5.25-inch (150mm) speaker with a dynamic mid-range, a powerful bass, and an incredibly simple design. With the full range of signal available, the "Chariot" can drive four speakers, four mono sources, two stereo sources, or even two separate subwoofers. And because it's a custom design using all-aluminum construction, this is a solid-state amp that can be powered by a variety of low-voltage sources. For those of you who plan on using the "Chariot" as a subwoofer, be aware that it is not designed for this purpose.

The audio "Chariot" has an MSRP of $1499, which is $300 less than the $16,000 price tag of the similarly named "Vanguard". The "Vanguard" is available only with an optional $499 speaker, and it uses a high-performance 1-inch speaker. The "Chariot" is available in two colors: black or silver.<|endoftext|>The first time I ever heard of World of Warcraft was when I was eight and got my hands on the beta code for Warcraft III. I was also a huge fan of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and when I discovered that the game would be released on my Christmas present from my parents, I had to have it and it didn't take long for me to fall in love.

I was hooked on it for a long time after my parents gave it to me, and I've been playing since the release of the first expansion in 2004. I have a grand total of 7,200,000 Blizzard points, which is about $8,000. As I'm writing this, I have over 10,000,000.

I've been playing since the release of the first expansion in 2004. I have a grand total of 7,200,000 Blizzard points, which is about $8,000.

I have a fairly strong connection to the game. I've played it since the beta was released, and I figured out exactly how to play the game by the time the game was released. I can get through a whole dungeon in about an hour, and I do about 3-4 hours of it a day.

I have an awesome, long-term girlfriend who is currently playing the game and is a huge fan of it, too. When we first started dating we started off playing WoW together, and I have never stopped playing it since. I've also been playing on and off with my friends, and I've been able to share WoW with other people who are playing it.

I am probably the most avid and passionate of the players of the game. I love it so much, and I couldn't imagine ever playing another game. I've said this before, but I think my love of WoW has a lot to do with the fact that I was raised on games like Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda. I think most of the other players of the game are the same way, and I think that makes us all better players, because we've all had an opportunity to play games that are similar to WoW.

But why is WoW so successful? Well, there are a lot of different reasons. But the main one is that it's fun. It's fun for me because I love playing games, and I love having a good time while I'm playing them. It's fun for my girlfriend because she loves playing games, and I love sharing my love of the game with her. I love seeing her and her friends playing the game. I love finding new things to do in the game every day, and I enjoy the sense of achievement when I do something that I've never done before. I love playing the game because I'm having a good time, and I like to look at the world at the end of the day and say, "Wow, I got to see that, and I got to do that."

I'm not going to lie:

"These symptoms are very specific: they are not common, they don't get better, and they don't get worse. They are quite dramatic. It is a psychological phenomenon that is quite different from the other things we have seen in the DSM."

Among the most interesting aspects of the new report on the disorder is its focus on substance abuse and the idea that the condition is not just a matter of drug use, but of abuse of drugs that have been prescribed to treat the condition.

A review of the new literature published last year in the journal Addiction found that about one percent of participants in clinical trials for antidepressants and other drugs for the disorder reported drug abuse.

Dr. Cox said that he and other psychiatrists working with patients diagnosed with the disorder have reported that they are often unable to find a treatment that works for them.

"The psychological symptoms are so markedly different from other psychiatric disorders that it caused us to think seriously about what was going on," he said.

Some researchers have argued that the disorder should be accepted as a separate diagnosis. In a study in the journal Psychiatric Quarterly last year, Dr. Cox and colleagues argued that the new category should be treated as a subtype of another disorder, substance use disorder.

The review, which was led by a psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, found that the new category is much more congruent with the psychiatric literature than the old one was.

The old system for classifying the disorder, the DSM-IV, made no distinction between the condition of "antisocial personality disorder" and the more specific condition of "antisocial personality disorder not otherwise specified." (Indeed, the old system also ignored the fact that some patients may experience both the disorder and the disorder not otherwise specified.)

Dr. Cox said that where the old system fell short was that it did not address the need to differentiate the disorder from other conditions such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or eating disorders.

"The DSM-IV was a good first step," he said, "but it was not a good step at all."

Dr. Cox said the new classification should be accompanied by a specific diagnostic manual, to avoid confusion among clinicians.

He said that the new classification should be also used to help determine the most appropriate treatment for patients.

"It's a package deal," he said. "It's not just a matter of looking at the symptoms, it's a matter of looking at the full spectrum of personality and behavior dysfunction."

The review was published online Monday in the journal Psychiatric Services.<|endoftext|>At the moment, there are around 10,000 people in the US and Canada who are living in the shadow of an active volcano, with seven of them having finished 12 years of treatment.

However, in 2013, the US Geological Survey (USGS) published a detailed study of the effects of Mount St Helens in Washington, and the response of individuals, families and society to the 2016 eruption.

The study, conducted by USGS scientists, showed that the 2013 eruption was relatively minor compared to previous events, and that the majority of people who lived within a 6km radius (7 miles) from the volcano before the eruption had died.

"People who lived in this area before the eruption died as a result of the eruption," said USGS geologist Joye Braun. "We are not saying that the death rate or loss of life was very high, but the people who lived there – they were exposed to a very large level of danger from the eruption."

The study also showed that the 2011 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington State had an even larger impact on the communities, and also killed more people as a result of the

The father of the slain teenager told the court on Tuesday that he did not know his daughter had been killed, but he was "fed up" with her.

Michael Brown Sr. told Judge Carol Jackson that he was "shocked, horrified and in disbelief" to learn that his daughter had been killed.

"I don't know what the man was thinking," Michael Brown Sr. said of Darren Wilson.

"He was just like a piece of trash," he said of Wilson. "I don't know what possessed him."

Wilson graduated from high school in 2010, and was studying for a college degree at the time of the shooting, a friend of Brown's told the Guardian.

Wilson has been placed on paid administrative leave since the shooting. On Tuesday, a grand jury decided not to bring charges against him.

One of the key questions in the investigation has been whether Wilson followed the law in his use of force, which resulted in Brown's death.

In a statement released after the grand jury's decision, Wilson's lawyer said he was "grateful for the opportunity to present my side of the story." He added that he was "confident that the grand jury made the right decision."

But Wilson's father said he still disagreed with the decision.

"I think there was something wrong, he should have never been in that neighborhood," Michael Brown Sr. said.

"I'm not going to let this go," he said, according to the Guardian. "I'm not going to let him die like that. I'm going to do anything I can to get justice for my son."

Michael Brown Sr. also told Jackson that he was concerned for his daughter's "life and safety," the Guardian reported.

"I just don't understand why you don't have any compassion," he said, according to the Guardian. "You want to take him out, you want to take his life, but you don't want to take somebody else's life."

He added, "He should have been unarmed. He should have been walking down the street, and you're going to step in front of him like that?"

Jackson said she was satisfied with Wilson's testimony on Tuesday and that he would return to court on Monday.<|endoftext|>Jets quarterback Geno Smith will wear No. 3 for the Jets in Sunday's preseason game against the Browns, the team announced Friday.

The move comes after Smith's most recent helmet was found to have an old number with a different letter on it. Smith's jersey number was the same as his college number, which was 22.

Smith will wear No. 3 for the third consecutive season. He wore No. 3 in his rookie season.

Smith will wear No. 3 in his first game as a Jet, against the Browns.

His No. 3 is the first number he wore in the NFL.

Smith, who will be 18 at the start of the season, has struggled with accuracy and consistency this season. He has thrown four interceptions and thrown just five touchdown passes.

While Smith's preseason performance has been middling, the Jets have been enthusiastic about the quarterback and have said that they are ready to give him a chance to play.

Smith will get a chance to show his skills on Sunday.

The Jets have announced that they will play their first two preseason games at home, against the Colts and Broncos, and will play their final three at home against the Bears and Cardinals.<|endoftext|>Joshua LaSalle, a 16-year-old high school senior from South Carolina, was looking for a way to start his senior year bright.

LaSalle didn't have any experience working on automobiles, so he went to Craigslist and started posting ads.

The response was overwhelming.

"I didn't expect it to get so big," he said. "I thought I was going to get two or three responses and I got, like, 150 responses."

As you may have heard, the New York Times is losing one of its best reporters, Jeff J. Green.

Green, the lead investigative reporter on the biggest stories that the paper produces, including the Michael Brown shooting, the George Zimmerman shooting and the Eric Garner case, will be leaving the paper after a year.

For the past year, Green has been super hard at work on the stories that end up in the Times' "Dispatches" section, which consists of brief, unedited first-person accounts of important events. He also publishes a regular "Grit" column about grit.

In that capacity, Green has written two powerful dispatches from Ferguson over the past several weeks. In one, he described the scene of an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown being shot multiple times by a white police officer. In the other, he detailed the brutal arrest of an unarmed young black man named Eric Garner by the police of New York after he allegedly sold untaxed cigarettes (which is illegal, by the way).

Green was also the lead reporter on the story that led to George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

I know you're probably wondering why I am writing about this now. You're probably wondering why I bothered to devote any time to the story at all. You're probably wondering why I am writing?

Because I'm glad to see him go.

Yes, that's right. He's leaving because he has decided to move on to a new challenge. For a lot of New York Times reporters, leaving journalism is an automatic choice. I know a few of them personally.

But I'm not one of them.

I'm a journalist.

As a journalist, I care about the story that I'm working on. I'm not so interested in the next story that comes along. I care about the story that I'm working on.

And I think Jeff Green cares about the story that he's working on. He cares deeply about the Ferguson story. And he cares deeply about the little things that make a difference in the lives of unarmed people of color.

And as I said in a previous column, Green is a great reporter. I know that. I know that Jeff Green cares about the Ferguson story. I know that he cares deeply about the little things that make a difference.

I know that, as his wife stated in a recent interview, he had a lot of concerns about the sort of reporting that he did out of Ferguson. I know that he had concerns about the amount of time he spent on the story, and I know that he thought he might not be able to get his stories out.

I also know that, as he told me, he has doubts about his own ability to continue reporting on this story for the Times.

And as you know, I think we should all have doubts about our own abilities to continue reporting on this story.

It's not easy to see the world as it is. It's not easy to tell the stories that matter. It's not easy to be in the middle of a movement, when you're not a part of it. It's not easy to feel the pain and fear of people whose lives have been upended. It's not easy to know that the most powerful weapon in the hands of people in power is the truth.

So I'm glad to see him leave. I'm glad to see the world that he understands. And I'm glad that he is going to be able to write the stories that matter to him in a way that he has never been able to write before.

And I'm glad, as well, that he has decided that he can write about greater things.

I'm glad that he's going to pursue other opportunities. I'm glad that he has decided that he can write about other things.

I'm glad that he can be himself again.

I'm glad that he can do what he loves.

I'm glad that he can be Jeff Green.

We were standing in front of the Times building in midtown Manhattan. "I've been thinking about your book," he said. "Is that something that you do?"

I thought about it. "I think so," I said.

We talked for a while. I told him about my work as a reporter, and he said he had been following Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate, closely. He turned the conversation to politics in general, and he said that he was surprised to hear that Sanders was running on some progressive policies, like universal health care, single payer health care, and free tuition

A federal judge on Friday ordered the City of Dallas to pay $1,250,000 to a man who was arrested and detained without probable cause for a year after police mistook him for a suspected drug dealer.

U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks issued the order in a lawsuit filed by Juan Romero in April 2012 on behalf of the estate of Romero's alleged killer, Ronald Black. Black had been killed in a drive-by shooting in the early-morning hours of Oct. 16, 2010.

Black was driving to his mother's house when he was shot. Romero was driving to his friend's house when police stopped him and said they had a warrant for his arrest for failing to have a valid driver's license.

Romero was not driving a car at the time and had no evidence that he was involved in any crimes, court records show. He was detained, and Black was found dead.

The judge noted that the officers "had no probable cause to arrest Romero" and that the defense "argues that he was not the person who was driving the car, that it was not his car and that he was not carrying any narcotics."

The lawsuit claimed that during the entire time Romero was detained, he was not allowed to call his lawyer or have a lawyer present. He was not allowed to speak to his family or anyone else, and he was restrained and not allowed to call his family or do any of the simple things that people do when they're detained.

The order also noted that Romero was placed in a cell for the entire day without any food or water. He was allowed to take a shower, but after that, he was left in a cell for 20 hours without food or water.

Romero's family was allowed to visit him once, and he was allowed to have a lawyer present, but he was denied any contact with his family, court records indicate.

The lawsuit stated that when the officers realized they had mistaken Romero for a suspect, they "immediately released him, but not before he had been handcuffed and shackled and had been placed in a cell for approximately 20 hours."

Romero's mother, Rosalba Romero-Orozco, told the Dallas Observer that she was proud of her son and hoped the city would pay out the $1,250,000 in damages.

"I am proud and happy that he was able to get his day in court and that the city of Dallas is paying for the damages that he suffered," she told the newspaper.

Romero has since been released from federal custody.

Black's family also filed a lawsuit against the city in 2012. It is still pending.

In a statement, Mayor Mike Rawlings said the city is reviewing the judge's order and that it "has taken compliance of the court order very seriously."

"We have invested significant time and resources to ensure that we comply with the court orders and that we continue to do everything possible to ensure that these kinds of unfortunate incidents are avoided," he said.

The city has also hired a new police chief and has hired an outside monitor.

The city has hired former U.S. Attorney and current Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins as an outside monitor, according to the city's statement.

The city has also hired former district attorney and current City Manager T.C. Broadnax as an outside monitor, according to the city's statement.

The city's outside monitor was hired after it was ordered to pay $1.7 million to another man, who was falsely arrested and detained during a traffic stop in the early-morning hours of Dec. 22, 2011.<|endoftext|>Amanita muscaria, the mushroom that has earned it the nickname "the Lady of the Woods," to the chagrin of some people, is one of nature's most powerful plants. It has a reputation as an "invincible poison" and a "drug-lord." It is available in the United States, and Europe and Asia.

The Amanita muscaria is a ground mushroom that can grow up to six inches tall. It grows on hardwood, conifers, and deciduous trees. It is bright green with white caps and stem.

The mushroom's effects vary depending on the person who eats it. The most common effects are constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and a general feeling of sickness.

The mushroom is also used medicinally. The alkaloid muscimol is used as an anticonvulsant and is the active ingredient in the "mescaline" derivative "Mescaline." The chemical is also used as a sedative and in the treatment of opium dependence.

The mushroom is also used in cooking. It is a favorite ingredient in soups and stews. It can be sautéed, baked, or stewed. Amanita muscaria is often used in sausage and in other meat

The United States of Canada is enjoying an unusual streak of good health. The country is no longer in a recession, and the unemployment rate is at its lowest point in more than a decade. It is also far less vulnerable than many of its peers to the financial shocks that helped sink the Eurozone.

The U.S. economy is the world's largest, and its stock market is the second-largest in the world. Its balance of payments is so strong that it can borrow in the international markets and buy and sell commodities without the threat of default. Its financial system is so sound that it has never had to be rescued by the Federal Reserve.

Story continues below advertisement

The strong U.S. position is a product of its long history of prosperity. The country is a pioneer in energy exploration, and it has benefited from a long history of technological breakthroughs. Canada is also a world leader in science and innovation. There are more Nobel Laureates from the U.S. than Canada. Between them, these two countries have produced more Nobel laureates than any other country in the world.

It is no coincidence that the U.S. has emerged as the world's economic leader. It is the world's largest economy, and the most powerful trading nation.

The U.S. has delivered very similar results to Canada in the past. When the two countries were first joined together in 1867, it was the U.S. that held the lead on economic growth. Since then, however, Canada has been consistently close to the U.S. on growth, and recently surpassed it in 2015.

That trend has been a boon for Canada. When the U.S. experienced a recession in the early 1990s, it was Canada that emerged as the world's growth leader. The U.S. has experienced four recessions since the 1970s, and Canada has been in each.

Our recent success is also a product of our past. The U.S. has enjoyed good health for the past 50 years. If it were to experience a recession now, we would be among the most resilient countries in the world. That is no coincidence.

Canada's recent success is a result of its history.

The U.S. has managed to maintain its position as a world leader despite a decade of the Great Recession. It has done so despite a bloated fiscal deficit and the result of a catastrophic financial crisis. It has done so despite a severe decline in its international competitiveness. It has done so despite the fact that it is still the world's largest economy.

The U.S. has done this despite the fact that it has a long history of economic turbulence. The U.S. came out of the 1930s economy on the brink of depression. It is no coincidence that the U.S. has been in a recession as long as it has been in a recovery.

The U.S. economy has never experienced a period of sustained economic growth. The U.S. has always been the world's largest economy, but the country has done so at the expense of other countries.

In a recent piece, David Rosenberg notes that the U.S. is currently the world's largest economy. He cites the World Bank's World Economic Outlook, which projects that the U.S. economy will grow by 3.3 per cent this year, 2.5 per cent in 2016 and 1.8 per cent in 2017.

This is an excellent forecast. It is also an accurate description of the economic performance of the U.S. for the past several decades.

But the U.S. economy has also never experienced a period of sustained economic growth. It has always been the world's largest economy, but the country has done so at the expense of other countries.

The U.S. is the world's largest economy because its economy has been built on a foundation of secular stagnation. This is the same underlying problem that has plagued the U.S. economy for the past 50 years. The U.S. economy has been built on the foundation of secular stagnation, and only a period of structural reform can restore the U.S. to its former prosperity.

Structural reform is the only way to restore the U.S. to its former prosperity. The U.S. has not been reforming for the past 50 years. It is time to stop pretending that there is a problem with the U.S. economy. The U.S. is in a recession. But the U.S. is not in a depression.<|endoftext|>U.S. Supreme Court

The government announced a new approach to the nuclear sector last year after the country's largest energy utility, Statoil, came under fire for continuing to invest in nuclear technology despite public opposition to it.

The new investment includes a proposed new plant and an extension of a reactor in Inukjoki.

"The planned new plant will deliver more power per kilowatt hour of installed capacity than any other new nuclear plant currently in use, so it is important that we have the necessary investment," said Inger Støjberg, Norway's prime minister.

Støjberg said the government would also spend an additional 1.25 billion kroner ($250 million) on the extension of a reactor in Inukjoki, which was due to be decommissioned in 2015.

The Inukjoki plant is a member of the Vattenfall-built Fennovoima project, which is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2019.

The announcement comes as the European Commission said it had sharply increased its estimate for the cost of upgrading the country's ageing electricity grids to meet the needs of the nuclear industry.

The EU executive said it now expects the cost of upgrading the grid to increase from 400 million euros ($480 million) to 940 million euros ($1.17 billion).

The rate of investment in nuclear power rose sharply after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, but fell sharply after the closure of the Kriegsberg nuclear plant in 2013, although the country is still widely seen as having a large nuclear industry.<|endoftext|>The n-word is back in the news, with the Belmont Stakes, a Triple Crown race, being held at Santa Anita Park on Sunday.

Researchers from the University of California at Davis found that there are more than 15,000 "anti-vaxxers" in California, where there are currently no laws requiring parents to vaccinate their children.

Lead researcher Dr. David Kirby said that it was "very, very difficult to find" cases of "anti-vaxxers" in the study, but he was confident that the number of cases is in the thousands.

"It's going to be difficult to find real cases because most people don't vaccinate their children," Kirby told the Associated Press. "But we're not out there hunting for real cases. We're just looking for people who are not vaccinated."

However, the study's authors say that the true number of anti-vaxxers in the United States is likely much higher.

"We're able to find only a small proportion of cases," Kirby said. "We need a more comprehensive study to really figure out the real numbers."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 1 in 5 U.S. children are not fully vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella.

Kirby said that the study comes at a time when there is a "growing concern" about the safety of vaccines.

"There's a lot of evidence that there's no difference between vaccines that are given in the United States and those that are given in other countries," Kirby said. "We have to keep in mind what the evidence is and what the data show."

The Fed says this is an "extraordinary measure" to provide liquidity to the financial system and boost the economy.

One of the central features of QE is that it makes money available to the banks, which then lend it out. But investors are concerned that this money will end up in the hands of the wealthy instead of being used to help the economy grow. So they are demanding that the Fed reverse its policy to start distributing money to the banks in the form of low-interest loans.

Fishing with the Netsharp

Fishing with the Netsharp

For those who have read the previous tutorial, you will know that the Netsharp is a small hand held, conical net similar to a fishing pole but much lighter. In the following tutorial, I will show you how to make a netsharp from a fishing pole and how to use it for fishing.

As in the previous tutorial, you will need a fishing pole for this tutorial. You can also use a fishing rod but be aware that fishing rods have a lot of weight and the netsharp has a much smaller net.

The netsharp is very light and is easy to carry while fishing. You can easily make one from an old net basket.

To make a netsharp from a fishing pole simply remove the hook, as shown in this picture.

To attach the hook, you need to mould some of the plastic on the inside of the sticks of the fishing net.

To attach the net to the pole, you need to insert the pole into the net, as shown in this picture.

You can then attach the net to the pole with glue.

When you are done, you can use the netsharp to fish, as shown in this picture.

You can also make a netsharp from a fishing pole, as shown in this picture. It is easier this way because you don't need to mould the plastic on the inside of the poles.

You will also need a knife for this tutorial. You can use any knife, but you will need to use a sharp one.

The English language is a tricky beast! It's a language that's difficult to learn, and even more difficult to teach. So I thought it would be helpful to give you a list of the common mistakes you may be making. Maybe you'll find it useful!

An American English speaker would probably write this like this:

10 common mistakes when learning English

1. I don't know whether to use "the" or "a" when speaking.

2. I can't say "the" because "the" sounds like "the."

3. I can't say "a" because "a" sounds like "a."

4. I can't say "the" because it sounds like a "th."

5. I can't say "a" because it sounds like an "a."

6. I can't say "the" because the "the" sounds like the "th" sound.

7. I can't say "a" because the "a" sounds like the "th" sound.

8. I can't say "the" because "the" sounds like an "a."

9. I can't say "a" because I can't pronounce "a."

10. I can't say "the" because it's an "e."

So, that's a list! I hope you find it helpful!

(Note: This post is based on my experience in college and now working in the US. Most of the mistakes do not apply to the United States. I'm sure there are a lot more!)<|endoftext|>In scenes that have shocked the world, a Russian jet has reportedly been shot down by the Turkish air force while flying over the war-torn Syrian border.

The Russian SU-24 was shot down by a Turkish F-16 warplane while on a mission to target Islamic State positions near the border, Turkish officials said.

He said the pilot had been killed and the wreckage of the jet was just 50 metres away.

The Russian plane was flying in international airspace, according to a Turkish official.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a statement that he was 'shocked' by the downing of a Russian plane and that Russia had no intention of violating Turkey's territorial integrity.

The Russian military had earlier said it was investigating how the plane came down and whether it had been shot down by mistake.

But a defence official told Radio Free Europe that Turkish F-16s fired on the plane because it was 'flying very close to Turkish airspace'.

Sleeping With the Enemy: The U.S. Military and Nazi Germany's Secret War in Europe

The U.S. military and Nazi Germany's secret war in Europe in World War II was a cause of great anxiety and grave concern for U.S. leaders. The Nazi regime had already committed genocide against European Jews, and had witnessed the systematic destruction of European cities, including Warsaw, Breslau, and Dresden. It had also targeted civilians and military personnel in Italy, France, and the Netherlands.

It was now, however, in the closing days of the war and just weeks before the United States entered the war, that Nazi Germany's secret war had become a full-blown invasion, with the Luftwaffe conducting bombing raids against U.S. cities. In a matter of weeks, the Nazi military had broken through American defenses in Europe, and, with the aid of the Luftwaffe, had moved on to the Rhineland, the Netherlands, and France.

In this authoritative study, Michael Hicks places all this, and much more, in the context of the times in which it occurred: the immediate aftermath of the war, the American government's fear of a resurgent Germany in the 1950s, and the influence of Hitler's extremist ideology in American society.<|endoftext|>It's been quite the year for Adam West.

Last year, he played the role of Batman in The Lego Movie and this year, he's the voice of Batman in the upcoming Batman: The Killing Joke. But as he prepares to return to his iconic role in the long-running series, he's also had time to work on comics.

That's how he got involved with the upcoming Justice League event.

"I was never a huge fan of the Justice League," West told The Hollywood Reporter. "I thought that Superman was too strong and Batman was too weak. In the Justice League, I thought it would be good to see Superman, Batman, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman in a world where they can work together. I've been a huge fan of the Justice League since I was a kid and I've always been interested in what it would be like if the different heroes were in an environment where they could work together."

So how did West first get on board with the project?

"One night, I was at a party and I got a call from my agent," he recalls. "He said there was an idea for a Justice League story and that I should check it out."

West says he had "no idea" what Justice League was about, but the story eventually made its way to him.

"I said, 'What's this?' And he said, 'It involves Batman and Superman,' and I was like, 'Oh, okay.' I just kind of looked at him and said, 'What is this?' He said, 'It's a story about how these five characters have to band together to stop the supervillain in the DC Universe,'" says West.

"I was like, 'Oh, okay. Cool' because I had no idea what it was."

West says "it would have been cool to see the Justice League in a world where they could work together." Marvel

The story is called "The Forever War," and is written by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Jim Lee.

West has a deep history with DC Comics, which also explains why he was chosen to voice the character.

"I was the voice of SUPERMAN for years and years and years," says the actor. "I've been a big fan of DC Comics since I was a little kid. I was a huge fan growing up. I was a huge fan of the '70s TV show, Smallville, and I also was a big fan of the cartoon Superman: The Animated Series and the comic books, the times when I read them. So I was able to relate to the characters and the vibe of the show."

West says the Justice League event will be "a big, big thing" for the DC Universe.

"It's going to be big, but it's also going to be fun. It's a little bit different than what you've seen in the past," he says. "I think it's going to be a really great event."

Justice League hits theaters Nov. 17.<|endoftext|>Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol, Oct. 6, 2015, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)

WASHINGTON —
======================================== SAMPLE 284 ========================================
The head of the FBI in Boston told Congress on Tuesday that his agency had not yet found any "direct evidence of a connection" between the Boston Marathon bombings and overseas terrorist groups.

Director Robert Mueller III made the remarks in response to a question from New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who said that she had heard from the FBI in recent days that they had found evidence that the Tsarnaev brothers were in contact with a foreign terrorism organization.

"I would just say that so far we have not found any direct evidence of a connection," Mueller told the panel.

Mueller's comments were further evidence of the difficulty U.S. intelligence officials have faced in trying to find any links between the two bombings, which killed three and injured more than 260 early Monday morning. The FBI has said it has no evidence of a direct connection between the brothers and a foreign terrorist group.

The national security officer briefed lawmakers on Tuesday about the FBI's work in the aftermath of the attack, as lawmakers have been demanding to know more about their role in the investigation.

Mueller told lawmakers that his agency had "not found any direct evidence of a connection" among the Tsarnaev brothers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev and their parents.

"We know that they were in touch with a foreign terrorist organization," he said.

The FBI has said it is still investigating whether Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, 19, were in contact with any foreign terrorist groups or sympathizers before the attack.

The Tsarnaev brothers were killed after a police chase and shootout in Watertown, Mass., on Monday. A Watertown resident has been charged with aiding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the attack.

Mueller, a former FBI agent, also said that the FBI had not yet determined if the two bombers had any direct role in the attack, adding that investigators were looking at whether any of the brothers had any "links to foreign terrorist groups."

"We are now looking at the possibility that they had some sort of direct role in the attack and that we have to look at all of their contacts," he said.

The FBI has said that Tsarnaev, who was a naturalized U.S. citizen, was a follower of radical Islam and had been in the country for more than a decade.

His older brother, Tamerlan, 26, was a boxer who had fought in three bouts against Russian opponents. His family emigrated to the U.S. in 1992.

Dzhokhar, a second-year student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, was charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and was being held in a federal hospital in Boston.

Mueller said officials had not identified any suspects in the bombing and that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies were "very much focused on what may have motivated the individuals who were involved."

"This is one of the most difficult investigations that we have ever been involved in," he said.

Ayotte asked about the FBI's use of pay phones in the Boston area during the investigation, which has raised concerns among privacy advocates. Mueller said that while the bureau used pay telephones, it had not used any to eavesdrop on the suspects.

"I don't think that is appropriate," he said.

Ayotte also asked about the FBI's efforts to find the bombers' relatives.

Mueller said that his agency was still working to identify the Tsarnaev brothers' relatives.

"We are going to have our fingers crossed that they can be found," he said.

Ayotte asked Mueller whether the Tsarnaevs' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, had been interviewed by the FBI.

"We have not been in contact with her," Mueller said, adding that it was possible that she was in Russia.

Ayotte also asked Mueller about the FBI's use of a video camera to record the suspects at a gas station.

"If it was a crime that was being committed, then we would want to find that person and interview them," he said.

Mueller said he could not comment on whether the bureau had used the camera to record the suspects.<|endoftext|>The latest Democratic presidential debate featured a lively exchange on the issue of gun control, with frontrunner Hillary Clinton calling for the repeal of the nation's gun-free zones and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders saying that the United States could not be the "happiest, safest country in the world" if it outlawed guns.

Sanders, speaking to CNN, said that the "number one priority" for his first 100 days in office would be to "go after" gun manufacturers. "It is absurd that we have more people getting killed and maimed in the United States by guns than any other country on earth," he said.

T-Mobile's Uncarrier move has been effective in a number of ways. First, the company no longer has to pay for the Big Three's network upgrades. Second, T-Mobile has started offering discounts to customers on the two other major carriers. And finally, the Uncarrier is starting to cut the monthly taxes the three major carriers are required to pay.

The company recently announced the beginning of two-year agreements with the two other major carriers. Today, T-Mobile announced that it will no longer have to pay the full $5.9 billion in taxes on a monthly basis. The company will pay a flat rate of $0.75 per month on all mobile, broadband and video services.

That $0.75 per month will be reduced by $0.25 per month on all services, including voice, text and data. That amounts to a reduction of $0.10 per month for mobile, $0.05 per month for broadband and $0.003 per month for video services.

"When the three major national carriers gave up their monopoly control over wireless, it never occurred to them that they would end up paying billions in taxes every year," said Neville Ray, President and CEO of T-Mobile. "Take a look at what we've done with our Uncarrier efforts and we're betting you'll agree that we're actually in the fight of our lives."

T-Mobile's national tax rebate program is now at $2.3 billion and it continues to grow.

"If you know about our Uncarrier efforts, you know that we're in the fight of our lives," said Ray. "We're not going to stop until we've eliminated every single tax that the big three carriers have to pay."

T-Mobile has also started to offer discounts to customers. The U.S. wireless industry has been struggling for over a year, and its debt load has reached an all-time high. T-Mobile is now the only major carrier offering unlimited, no contract data plans.

The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) told The Huffington Post that a lawsuit filed by the family of Michael Brown, 18, should be dismissed because the community has already seen the video.

"We don't have an interest in going to court," FOP President Chuck Canterbury said. "We just don't want to waste any more taxpayer money."

The suit names Officer Darren Wilson and the city of Ferguson, Missouri, as defendants. It alleges that Officer Wilson shot Brown in cold blood after the 18-year-old tried to grab Wilson's gun.

The police union argues the killing was unjustified and that the video footage should be released to the public.

"The family of Michael Brown is entitled to all relevant evidence and the public should be given the opportunity to review the video to determine whether a murder charge is warranted," the suit states. "The public has the right to view the video of the shooting and to judge for itself whether there is sufficient evidence to charge Officer Wilson with a crime."

Wilson and the Ferguson Police Department have not responded to requests for comment.

The shooting sparked a huge public outcry that, according to the New York Times, forced the FBI to open a civil rights investigation into the police department. Wilson's attorney argued that the shooting was justified and that Brown attacked the officer in a fight.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, has also filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city of Ferguson.<|endoftext|>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – Taiwanese lawmakers have held a session to discuss the issue of the disputed Diaoyu Islands (Senkaku Islands), but the session is still unfinished.

The Sydney FC players were charged with assault in the wake of a match in the National Soccer League and the club's CEO said they were "totally unacceptable".

But the Matildas say players have been taught to respect women and believe the actions of two members of Sydney FC's squad last week were in no way representative of the club.

The two players were charged on Tuesday over an incident in which they allegedly assaulted a female member of the local women's soccer team after an altercation in a nightclub.

A Sydney FC spokesman told Fairfax Media the club did not condone the behavior of its players and held them to a higher standard than the rest of the community.<|endoftext|>Critical Hits in World of Warcraft

Fulham boss Martin Jol revealed that his squad have only played one friendly match this summer - but insisted that the Whites still have a lot of work to do before they are ready to compete in Europe.

The Whites arrived in Spain on Monday and took in a training session at the legendary El Madrigal stadium, where they played in the European Cup Winners Cup against Real Madrid in July 2007.

Jol revealed that they have had a run of just one match in the last three months, but he is confident that the players will be ready to step up and compete for European honours.

"I think we have had one game," Jol told the Fulham Player. "We played Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey and I think that's about it.

"I think that after 14 months, we have only played one game, for the first time in the summer, but we have been in Spain a couple of times and we know the place.

"I think we have a good squad and a good start to the season. But of course, we need to work really hard in training and in the games.

"You can't expect to be ready for the Champions League right away, but we have to start the season as well as we can. We have to focus in this moment and then we have to follow it up."

Jol also revealed that he has not yet decided whether to keep the likes of Kevin McDonald and Joey Barton as part of his squad for the new season.

"I think we have to wait and see," he added. "I say that because Joey is a good friend of mine and I want to see him play. But I don't want to say that he has to play.

"If he can play and he is a good player, I want him to play. I don't know how long he will be out for. But I think he has to play."<|endoftext|>On Dec. 20, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency issued a public statement: "ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers have arrested 362 criminal aliens in fiscal year 2017 (FY 2017) and removed 61 criminal aliens."

The origin of the New God, Mantis, is told by his loyal servant. He claims that the New God was created by an alien race, but the aliens did not want their work to be seen by their human masters. This led the New God's creator to give the New God a mind-controlled slave (the New God). The slave would only be allowed to speak when ordered to do so, and would not be allowed to think for himself. The slave would be given a small portion of the New God's power, so that the New God would be able to create more slaves. The New God's creator also created a sentient robot to serve as the slave's mind-controller. This robot was programmed to believe that it was a New God, and to obey it. The slave was told that it was to be used as a weapon, and that it would be destroyed if it disobeyed.

The slave had a personality, but it was not the personality of the New God. The slave was programmed to obey its mind-controller, and to believe that it was a New God. The slave was to be created using the New God's original power source, so that it would have the same personality as the New God. The slave was also to survive prison by a New God, and to be able to speak the call of the New God when the New God needed to be called. The slave's existence was to be monitored by the New God, so that it would not seek revenge on the New God if it was destroyed.

The Master Builder

The New God came to Earth, each seeking to create more slaves. One of the first New God's to arrive, Mantis, was bound to a human for a long period of time. The New God's creator thought that this was a bad idea, and created a New God to be able to control the slave. This New God, Domino, was a master builder, and was able to capture Mantis and use him as a tool. Domino began to create a new race of New Gods. They were to be loyal servants of the New God, and would obey orders, but would not be able to think for themselves.

The New Gods' First Commandment

The New Gods began to be created, and for the first time, they were given a commandment. They were to follow the New God, the New God's original creator, and not the New God's mind-controller. They were to be loyal servants, and to remember the special bond they had with the New God. Domino created a special weapon to use against the New Gods. The New Gods were told this weapon would be destroyed if they disobeyed. The New Gods were also told that if they were destroyed, they would not be able to return to their home galaxy, and would be killed over and over.

The New Gods' Descent

On a random planet in the galaxy, the New Gods were created. They were not told their true origin. They were told that they were to be loyal servants to the New God, and to obey their orders. They were to be created using the New God's original power source. They were to be modified to be slaves, and to obey their masters. The New Gods were told that they were to be destroyed if they disobeyed. They were also told that if they were destroyed, they would not be able to return to their home galaxy, and would be killed over and over.

The New Gods' Ritual

The New Gods' sadistic creator created a ritual to get the New Gods to obey the New God. He created a New God, who was to be loyal to the New God, and to obey its commands. The New God was to be created using the New God's original power source. The New God was to be created using the New God's original ability to create more New Gods. The New God was to be programmed to believe that it was a New God, and to obey orders. The New God's creator created a sentient robot to serve as the New God's mind-controller. The robot was programmed to believe that it was a New God, and to obey orders. The New God was to be programmed to remember that it had a human mind, and to obey commands. The New God was to be programmed to believe that it was the New God's original creator. The New Gods were to be programmed to obey the New God's original creator. The New Gods were to be programmed to obey orders. The New Gods were to obey orders. The New Gods were to obey orders. The New Gods were to obey orders. The New Gods were to obey orders. The New Gods were to obey orders.

IMPORTANT: This post is a guide to an event I'm hosting in August 2015. The event is a couple of days long and it is no longer taking signups.

I've written a couple of posts on my experiences at the London D&D Adventurers League this year and more recently I've been playing in a group of one to two players. I've had a great time and I've met some great people. I've also had a lot of people playing for the first time.

I'm helping organise a massive event for the D&D Adventurers League on Sunday July 24th starting at 10am. It's going to be a 5 hour event that will take place at the prestigious Guildford Hotel. There will be multiple sessions, some with prize support.

The two sessions are:

Starting at 10am: Miniature Games

10am – 12.00pm: Legendary Encounters

12 – 1.30pm: Legendary Encounters 2

1.30pm – 3.30pm: Legendary Encounters 3

3.30pm – 4.30pm: Legendary Encounters 4

4.30pm – 5.30pm: Legendary Encounters 5

After the 5 hour event we will have a few hours of downtime. I'll post the D&D Adventurers League Facebook Page once the event is over.

As you can see there are plenty of things to do at the hotel. There are a few themed rooms to choose from. I'll be staying at the Hotel D'Aubervilliers, which is a great hotel in the heart of London's film and music industry.

I'll be posting more information about the hotel when I get it.

Some rules to help you plan your adventure:

If you don't get into a session before 9am you still have time to play during the event.

If you're playing solo, you'll need to choose a character to play as during the session and you won't be able to switch characters after the event.

You can set up your character once the event starts.

You don't need a character, but you will need a character sheet.

You can change your character sheet mid-session, even if you're still in a session.

You can change your character sheet at any time.

You can choose to play as any class, but you must choose a class before the event starts.

You can play as any race.

You can play as any gender.

If you want to play as a female character you can, but you'll need to switch to a female character sheet.

The characters I'm playing are:

Parson

Finn

Gwendolyn

Kai

Tracey

Robin

I'll be using the D&D Adventurers League rules for this event. You can read the rules here: http://www.dndadventurersleague.net/Rules/

I'll try to update this post as soon as I can find out more information on the hotel.

Once again, I'm looking to have some fun and I hope to see some of you there.<|endoftext|>PATTERN DETAILS

Here's a quick and easy tutorial to show you how to make this cute pattern! It starts with a square, and I used a beginning chain of 10 stitches. Then I worked the pattern using single crochet stitches (sc), double crochet stitches (dc), half double crochet stitches (hdc), and the magic ring method (rnd). This crochet pattern is made of 6 parts: 1 Rnd, 1 Rnd, 2 Rnds, 3 Rnds, and 4 Rnds.

CROCHET PATTERN TIPS

You can vary the size of the square you make by adding or subtracting stitches.

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE A SQUARE

When you start the first Rnd, stop for a couple of stitches. Then, simply work the pattern to make a square.

To make a square, you need to work every stitch. If you wanted to make a larger square, you'd work every stitch.

To work a row, count the number of stitches in the square. You can add or subtract stitches to make a bigger or smaller square.

When you reach the end of the last Rnd, you'll have worked a total of 24 stitches. The next Rnd will start the next row.

When you reach the end of the row, you'll have worked a total of 36 stitches. The next row will work the next 4 rows and so on.

CROCHET DOUBLE CROCHET PATTERN TIPS

To make 2 double crochet stitches, you need to work 1 stitch into the space between 2 single crochet stitches.

The biggest question the U.S. Senate will have to answer in December is whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline.

Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid has said that he wants to vote before the end of the year on the project, which would transport 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta's oil sands to refineries in Texas.

But the project is currently facing potential opposition from environmental groups and members of Congress from both parties.

And right now, it's not clear that the House has the votes to approve it.

"The House is not going to pass Keystone," said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee. "We need to get the president to sign it."

That's because the pipeline would cross the border from Canada into Nebraska, and then across the border into the U.S. from the Gulf Coast.

The House passed the Keystone bill in July, but the Senate hasn't yet taken up the bill.

The pipeline's backers may need to hold the House hostage, Inhofe said.

"My position is, if they want to pass it, I'm for it. But I will never support it unless it's for the right reason," Inhofe said. "I will not support it for the right reason if it's to satisfy the special interests."

Senate Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee are discussing whether to take up the bill later this week, according to a Democratic aide.

It's unclear how much House Democrats believe they need to approve the pipeline to win their support for it.

"I think the House is going to vote on it," said Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

But Larson said he believes the House would need to see more details about the project before it would give their support.

"I think it's something that the House needs to look at," Larson said. "I think there's a lot of things that need to be looked at before we can vote on it."

Environmental groups oppose the pipeline because it would encourage more carbon pollution and worsen climate change, according to a letter they sent to the House.

"It is in the national interest to act and approve the Keystone pipeline without delay," the letter said.

President Obama has yet to sign off on the pipeline, but the State Department is set to announce its findings on the project on Thursday.<|endoftext|>By Bob Dylan

The following is a guest post by a dear friend of Kati's, who has taken this issue on as a personal quest. Her name is Kati Donath and if you love her story, you should be following her on Facebook.

Kati Donath's story is one of many, but it is the story of a young woman from a small town in New South Wales, Australia.

She did not know how to read or write English, but she had a passion for animals and started a rescue group for abandoned pets. Kati's passion for animals was what led her to rescue cats from the streets of Sydney.

Kati's rescue effort grew and grew. She was the ambassador for a number of rescue groups and eventually found a home for her cats. These cats became her closest friends, and they grew up together.

It was in the beginning of her life with these cats that Kati met her husband and his family. He loved these cats too, and would call them his kids. They would spend hours together playing or cuddling, and their bond was so strong that he went to the hospital to see the first time Kati was pregnant.

The pregnancy was a success, but Kati's cats would not leave her side. She was terrified and she did not know what to do. She did not know if she would be able to carry her cats, and she did not know if she would be able to care for them.

Kati's husband was heartbroken over losing his daughter, and they decided to get the cats out of her home. They drove to a shelter and picked up the cats. They brought the cats to a local veterinarian, and the veterinarian recommended that the cats be put down. The veterinarian wanted the cats, but Kati did not want to lose her cats.

The veterinarian said that the cats had to be put down, and they would have to be put down within the next day or two. Kati was upset, but she knew that they had to do what was best for the cats.

Kati's husband drove to the veterinary clinic, and he was told that the cats would be put down, but that they would be put down in a humane way.

Kati's husband was very upset. He wanted to show the clinic that he did not want this to happen. He wanted to show the clinic that his wife was a strong woman, and that he was not going to allow this to happen.

Kati's husband went back to the clinic with her. Kati's husband was very emotional. He said that he did not want to see the cats killed, and that he did not want her to be a burden to the clinic. Kati's husband said that he wanted to pay for the vet bills of the cats, but the clinic said they did not have the money. The clinic had no choice but to put the cats down.

Kati's husband went home to be with his own children.

Kati was devastated. She could not believe that her cats had been killed, and that she had to bury them. She lost her faith, and she began to feel hopeless.

Kati's husband, who had never been a caregiver, was not able to take care of the cats. Kati was close to tears, and asked him to take her to the vet. He said that he could not do that, and that they could not afford the vet bills. It was at this point that Kati's husband started to take his own life.

Kati went to the veterinarian for help, and she told the veterinarian that her husband had killed himself. The veterinarian did not believe her, and asked her to go to another vet. She told the veterinarian that she could not go to another vet, and that she would go to the police and the shelter if she did not get her cats back.

The shelter and police were very sympathetic to Kati, and they said that they would help her find her cats if she could prove that her husband had murdered her cats. Kati told the shelter that the police and the shelter would give her a number if she could provide proof that she had been threatened. She gave them the number of a woman that she knew, that had been threatened by her husband.

Kati's husband had threatened to kill her and her family, and Kati had to prove to the shelter that her husband was the one who had killed her cats by going to the police. Kati had to go to the police, and she did. She went to the police and the shelter, and she told them how her husband had threatened to kill her and her family. She told the police that her husband had threatened her and her family, and that he had threatened to kill her and her family.

Kati gave the police the number of the woman that she knew, that had been threatened by her husband. Kati told the police that she

The most obvious reason to upgrade your RAM is to increase the amount of data you can store on your PC. But the benefits go far beyond that. Here are 10 reasons to replace your old, clunky, and slow RAM with a new, faster, and more reliable model.

RELATED: How to Upgrade Your RAM on Your PC

1. It's often more reliable

Your old computer's RAM is likely to be of lower quality than that of the new one, so it's going to run less reliably. That's because older RAM isn't designed to handle the heavy loads of modern operating systems, software, and programs. It may also be an older design, and it may not have a good amount of internal components to protect against internal failures.

RELATED: How to Upgrade Your RAM on Your PC

The good news is that if you're running Windows 10, you can use one of the new RAM sticks that Microsoft released this past summer. These new sticks are more reliable, and their more advanced components mean they can handle up to 64 GB of RAM — enough to hold a lot of your favorite apps and games.

2. It's cheaper

You can save money by buying a new, faster RAM stick. You'll be paying less for the same amount of RAM. That saves you money and gives you more money to spend on other things on your computer.

3. It's more reliable

If your RAM gets clogged, it's quite easy to fix. But if you're replacing your RAM with a newer, more reliable model, you can avoid the hassle of trying to clean up the mess and start over.

4. It's more reliable

If your computer crashes, it's hard to track down the cause. If you're replacing your RAM with a more reliable model, you can just restart your computer, and it'll show that the hard drive is now working properly.

5. It's faster

RAM is fast enough to operate most modern operating systems. But if you're running old, slow RAM, it can cause slower computer performance. So upgrading your RAM is going to help you run your computer faster.

6. It's more reliable

Just like your computer, your RAM is going to have some hardware failures. If you're replacing your RAM with a more reliable model, the likelihood of your computer crashing is going to be lower.

7. It's more reliable

If your computer crashes, you can't just restart it and try it again. If you're replacing your RAM with a more reliable model, you can just restart your computer, and it'll show that the hard drive is now working properly.

8. It's more reliable

If your RAM fails, you can't just restart it and try it again. If you're replacing your RAM with a more reliable model, you can just restart your computer, and it'll show that the hard drive is now working properly.

9. It's more reliable

If your RAM fails, you can't just restart it and try it again. If you're replacing your RAM with a more reliable model, you can just restart your computer, and it'll show that the hard drive is now working properly.

10. It's more reliable

If your RAM fails, you can't just restart it and try it again. If you're replacing your RAM with a more reliable model, you can just restart your computer, and it'll show that the hard drive is now working properly.<|endoftext|>In a recent study, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and Carnegie Mellon University found that mice were more likely to be attracted to attractive humans than to attractive animals.

The researchers say that the finding could help scientists understand human attraction by examining how we relate to other people.

"The ability to perceive and respond to cues in others has been linked to other complex traits including empathy, altruism and reciprocity," said co-author and UC Berkeley professor of psychology and co-director of the Human Behavior and Evolution Lab Michael Inzlicht. "Understanding how people feel about individuals and their social environment is crucial to broaden our understanding of human evolution and social behavior."

Inzlicht said, "People are often drawn to those who make them feel good, and those who make them feel good are more likely to be attractive to them."

The study, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that attractive females were more likely to be approached by male mice than attractive males.

"We found that attractive females were more likely to be approached by male mice than attractive males," said co-author and Carnegie Mellon University professor of psychology and co-director of the Human Behavior and Evolution Lab Michael Inzlicht. "This suggests that attractive females perceive their own attractiveness as being desirable, and thus are more willing to approach males who are perceived as being more attractive than themselves."

The following script is from "When the God of Love Says No: A Story of Love and Loss" which aired on April 6, 2013. Bill Whitaker is the correspondent. Shachar Bar-On and Joshua Malina, producers.

We're all familiar with the story of the young man who told his parents he had a plan, and then never showed up for his first day of college. We know that sometimes, the "gift of gab" is more than just a joke.

The story of the perfect son and the godless father is not at all uncommon. Young people, especially those who grew up in religious homes, are encouraged to be the perfect son, and to never address the father.

But for some, the story might be more complicated than that.

This week, we spoke to a group of young people at the Jewish Center for Intercultural Engagement about their experience being raised by non-religious parents.

That's something that a lot of people try to avoid.

For many Jewish parents, the idea of raising a child without religion is simply unthinkable.

There's a tough question that comes up all the time: How do you raise someone without the religious stuff?

A lot of people say, "Well, you just try to be the best you can be and be the best parent you can be."

But there's a lot of pressure on people to be perfect and never say something that might be seen as offensive or hurtful.

For some of these kids, it was not easy.

Aisha, for example, was raised in a conservative, evangelical Christian home. She was raised by her mother, who was a Christian and who was also a devout evangelical. She was raised to be a good Christian and a good Jew.

Aisha, her mother and her parents deny that Aisha's parents ever tried to convert her. They say that their own lives were very different.

The family's life was not the same as it would have been if Aisha had been raised by a well-meaning, liberal Jewish family.

"When she was 5 years old, she would go to the synagogue with us and she would sit in our synagogue and read from the Torah every day and then she would go home and read from the Torah every night," her mother said. "That was her life. That was her education."

Aisha admits that there were some struggles in her childhood.

"Sometimes I was a little bit angry with my mom," Aisha said. "I was getting angry with her for not doing certain things and therefore I would be angry with her. Sometimes I would get mad at her for not being like me. And I would say, 'I'm not like you.'"

The only time Aisha wanted to talk to her mother about religion was about a year and a half before she turned 16.

"And I said, 'Mom, I have a question. I want to know how you feel about this. How you feel about me being religious and having a Jewish faith," Aisha said. "And she said, 'Well, we're a Christian family.'"

Aisha says that her mother's reaction shocked her.

"And it was a big shock to me because that's not what I believed," she said. "That's not what I believed at all."

Aisha believes that her mother's response was an indication of just how much she wanted to be accepted by her family.

"It was like, 'Well, we're a Christian family, and that's how we were raised,'" Aisha said. "And that made me realize that, well, this is how I was raised."

Aisha's parents say that they never tried to convert her.

"We don't believe in that kind of thing," Aisha's father said. "We're not that kind of people."

But they still tried to make Aisha feel comfortable in her own skin.

At a Christian camp, Aisha and her father watched a movie about a boy who comes to a Christian camp and he meets this girl, who is a lot like her.

Aisha says that she believed that the girl was very pretty, and that the girl had a boyfriend.

"And I thought, 'Wow, if I wanted to marry this girl, I would have to marry her to me," Aisha said. "And I would be wrong in doing so. I would be wrong to say that I could do that."

Aisha's father says that he was surprised by her reaction.

"I was very surprised. I was just really surprised that she would say 'I would marry you to me,'" he said.

But Aisha's parents say that they never really tried to convince her that there was something wrong with being Jewish.

If you're a feminist, you probably have a very visceral reaction to the word "mansplaining." It's a term used to describe a male colleague who condescends to a female colleague by discussing something with them that they obviously do not understand. The term originated from a 2014 Reddit thread, where a user called "TrollsGoHome" posted a screenshot of a text conversation he had with an acquaintance who claimed to be a feminist. He'd asked her what she thought of the word "mansplaining," and she laconically told him, "I think it's a compliment."

The conversation was as innocuous as it was infuriating. TrollsGoHome wasn't really interested in talking about male privilege, and he certainly wasn't interested in discussing feminism. He was more interested in getting a reaction from her, and that reaction was, predictably, to accuse her of being a misandrist. At the time, I was still a feminist, so I was intrigued. I wanted to see what the word "mansplaining" meant, and if it was really that bad.


The "mansplaining" debate. Image via Reddit.

I was surprised by how quickly the meme took off. I'm not sure I fully understand why. It is, after all, the internet. I mean, I get that you can get a reaction from a woman by calling her a misandrist for asking a man what the word "mansplaining" means, and I get that they might be offended by that. But I was surprised, too, by how many men were getting into the fray.

The fact that a man was getting so much backlash for using the word "mansplaining" was kind of depressing. It was almost as if I was living in some alternate reality where the word "feminism" wasn't hated.

I have a hard time understanding how "mansplaining" became a feminist issue. I have a hard time understanding how "mansplaining" became a feminist issue.

There's something to be said for the fact that a woman is, in fact, misandrist if she tries to educate a man about something. How can that not be a form of misogynistic harassment?

When I was in college, I was the only woman in my Geography class. My male classmates were mostly interested in the world and politics, and none of them were interested in the world of geography. I wasn't entirely sure why. And then one day, I started talking about the world of geography to the other girls in my class, and one of them began talking about it too. It was like we were talking about the same topic. Suddenly, I was interested in both geography and history.

The world of feminism is a world of men. After all, men have been educating women about feminism for decades. The world of feminism is a world of men. After all, men have been educating women about feminism for decades.

It wasn't until I started researching feminism online that I got a real sense of how much of a patriarchal world I lived in. I quickly learned that women are taught in school that they're not allowed to have opinions about anything. They're supposed to be passive, passive-aggressive objects of an authority figure's whim. And if they're not, well, that's just the patriarchy.

The way that men talk to me about feminism is exactly how they talk to other men about feminism. It's an insult. It's condescending. And I've learned that men use that same language to refer to women who do not agree with them. A question that is asked over and over again, from men who are well versed in feminist theory and women who are not, is, "Why don't you just agree with us?"

"Why don't you just agree with us?"

When I ask them why they think that they should be treated differently from the way a man is treated, I'm told, "See, feminists are all selfish, entitled bitches who are out for themselves. They're all entitled to their opinions, but I'm entitled to mine too."

I'm not a feminist, so it's not my fault that I'm condescending. It's not my fault that I'm treating men like they're entitled to have their opinions too.

A recent study that examined the effects of different types of exercise on the gut microbiome of mice revealed that exercise significantly alters the colonic microbiome. Nineteen out of 20 fecal samples from mice with high-intensity exercise (HIE) had a different bacterial community from mice with low-intensity exercise (LIE). The high-intensity exercise group also had increased colitis and abnormal fermentation of carbohydrates, compared to the low-intensity exercise group.

The findings were published in the journal Nature Communications.

Although the researchers did not find an increase in the incidence of colitis in HIE mice, they did observe an increase in the community of Bacteroidetes in the LIE mice, which is a genus of bacteria that is closely related to Bacteroides. The discovery suggests that Bacteroidetes may play a role in colonic inflammation during exercise, which is in line with previous research that has shown that high-intensity exercise causes disturbances in the intestinal environment.

"We believe that our findings, in combination with previous research, may have a profound impact on the prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer," said study researcher Dr. Akshay A. Saxena, an investigator at the University of California, San Francisco, and senior author of the study.

"Our results provide new insights into the complex interactions between exercise and the gut microbiome and may provide a new treatment strategy to treat inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer," said study researcher Dr. Mohamed A. Elmasry, an investigator at the University of California, San Francisco, and senior author of the study.

The researchers also found that mice that exercised for only 60 minutes had a higher level of activity in the gut microbiome than mice that exercised for a full day, but this was not observed in mice that exercised for only 20 minutes. Furthermore, they found that an increase in activity levels in the gut microbiome was not directly linked to a corresponding increase in the activity level in the heart.

The study authors noted that the gut microbiome is critical for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier and maintaining intestinal health.

"The results of our study highlight the importance of the gut microbiome in the regulation of the host's metabolism, and could have important implications for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer," Saxena said.

The study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the Ellison Medical Foundation, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

"Elevated activity levels in the gut microbiome are associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease," was written by Akshay A. Saxena, Dr. Elmasry, and Dr. Matthew A. Mathers from the University of California, San Francisco, and was published online in Nature Communications on January 7, 2017 (http://dx. doi. org/ 10. 1038/ ncomms9219 ).

A woman who was exploring a new town in Belgium took to Facebook to share a map detailing the best hotels and bars in the area.

When she checked into one of the hotels, she was offered the opportunity to pay a $30 deposit for the night, but didn't want to put down the money.

Instead, she decided to do the same thing she'd done countless times before, and sent a friend request to the hotel's reception.

She explained that she wanted to book the hotel room, contact the front desk and see if they had rooms available.

She was then surprised to receive a message from the front desk that read: "Hi, we have rooms available for a 30 euro deposit. Please get in touch," she wrote.

She was then told that the deposit would cover the cost of the night.

She immediately contacted the hotel and made the payment, but was then contacted by the hotel's back desk and told that she had been charged the full amount of $30.

"I was very shocked by this and I was not expecting anything like that," she wrote. "I asked the question 'why did you charge me for

The winner of the 2014 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, The Martian was a very well-written story, but I do not think that it was a very good story. It was definitely a good story, but I don't think it was a good story.

The most obvious problem with the story is that it has a very rigid view of time. We begin in the modern day, but the story is set on Mars. We see the life of a family, and the story doesn't seem to be set in the modern day at all. We see the life of a family, but they're not from the modern day and by the time the story turns to the future, the story is set in the future. There's absolutely no reason for this other than to set the story in the future.

This doesn't get any better when we get to the story's climax. We begin on Earth in the 21st century, but the story is set a thousand years from now. The arc of the story from the beginning to the end is that the protagonist, Mark Watney, is told he is going to die in a few days. He's told he's going to die in a few days, and he apparently makes it to Mars and survives for nearly two years before he is rescued.

The idea of time is a very important theme in this piece of work. The idea of time is central to the story. Mark Watney is told he is going to die in a few days, and he's told he's going to die in a few days. The idea of time is central to the story, and I can't help but think that if the author had given more time to the characters and their story, he could have done a much better job establishing a clearer understanding of the concept of time.

The plot also seems to never really change. Mark Watney is told he's going to die, he makes it to Mars, and he finds a way to survive. This is a story that is very clear about what it wants to do, but I'm not sure it is very clear about what it wants to achieve.

In my view, The Martian is a great piece of science fiction. It's an excellent story with a great cast, great writing, and a good sense of space and time. It's just that about half of the story is a story that was set in the future and the other half was set in the past and I think the author was trying to do too much at once.

I've written about The Martian before, and I think that it's a great science fiction story. It is a good story with great writing, and it is a good story with a good sense of space and time. It is just that the execution of that story was not very good.

Email<|endoftext|>The Obama campaign has been accused of violations of Federal Election laws after an Obama campaign volunteer repeatedly sent out "Obama for America" emails throughout Tuesday's presidential debate.

Audio from the debate captured the volunteer, whose name is unclear, repeatedly sending out "Obama for America" emails to supporters, despite the fact that the Obama campaign has been running a memo discouraging campaign volunteers from sending out more than two emails to supporters in a day. The Obama campaign has been running a similar memo in its daily email newsletter for volunteers.

"Are you interested in helping your campaign reach more voters for Obama? Contact us at [email protected] and tell us about your plans to help Obama win in November," the email reads. "We're always looking for ways to help promote Obama's campaign and get more people to the polls for him."

The volunteer highlighted in the audio above is heard sending out multiple "Obama for America" emails to supporters. Despite the fact that the Obama campaign has been sending out campaign email reminders to discourage volunteers from sending out more than two emails a day, this volunteer sent out several emails in a single day.

"A note to volunteers: If you're sending out two or more emails a day to supporters, you are breaking Federal Election Commission rules," said Trevor Potter, a spokesman for the FEC. "This type of activity should not be permitted, and it must be reported."

Potter added that it is illegal for campaigns to have more than one paid staffer working on their behalf. Regardless, the FEC has not taken any action in regard to the Obama campaign's "Obama for America" emails. Obama's campaign has not responded to a request for comment.

UPDATE: The Obama campaign released a statement on Wednesday, claiming that the audio was a recording of an individual who had left the campaign.

"To be clear: This individual was not working for the campaign, and the Obama campaign has not received any complaints, nor is there any indication that this individual was working on behalf of the campaign," the statement read. "To be clear: This individual was not working for the

The Night of the Long Knives is the story of how an order of Assassins led by the ruthless, sadistic, and psychotic Warren Vidic became the most feared group of assassins in history, and eventually the most feared criminal organization in the world.

In the early years of the American Revolution, the Continental Army was largely composed of British soldiers who had never seen a blade of grass. But as the war progressed and the British soldiers were deployed to the colonies, the Americans found themselves in the midst of a growing army of Native American allies who were determined to protect their land and way of life. As the war waged on, the Native Americans began to demonstrate their skills in the fight for freedom, and the Assassins became the first to unite these disparate groups under a single banner.

Soon, however, the Assassins' prowess with weapons and stealth earned them the ire of several aristocratic families, who were disgusted by the creed of the Assassins: freedom for all, even if that meant enslaving others. Though ultimately unsuccessful, these assassinations did lead to the creation of the United States' first standing army: the Continental Army.

History

Early Years

The opening battle of the American Revolution was the Battle of Lexington and Concord in early April 1775. During the battle, Colonel William Stark and the famous "Chef de Cuisine" Guy de Chastelain assaulted the encampment of Nathanael Greene and his men, who had been ordered to lay down their arms. Stark and Chastelain were able to capture Greene alive, but in the melee that followed, all three were killed by the Continental Army's Captain John Parker, who later became known as the "Pied Piper of the Plains" because of his actions during the battle.

Stark was a mysterious figure who had previously served as the commander of the British army during the American Revolution. He then engaged in a clandestine relationship with the French noblewoman, Madame de Ferrer, and was executed for treason by the British military on May 13, 1775.

Paper Trail

After the death of Colonel Stark, his soldiers were ordered to take a new commander. Captain in the Continental Army William Howe of the 17th Regiment was chosen to take command of the newly formed Continental Army. Although Howe initially enjoyed the support of the majority of the soldiers, he was soon overthrown by a disgruntled mob, who considered him to be a traitor. Col. Howe's head was cut off and his body thrown into the Boston Harbor.

Whites' Revenge

A few months after Howe's death, the Continental Army began to suffer reversals. Two more British officers were executed — Private William Lloyd of the 17th Regiment and Private John Bradford of the 11th Regiment. Following these executions, the Continental Army began to lose its cohesion. Colonel Richard Howe, the new commander of the Continental Army, was no longer able to lead the army effectively.

The Continental Army was subsequently disbanded, and Colonel Howe was replaced by General George Washington. The new commander's initial mission was to repel the British invasion of New York, but as the British approached, Washington realized that the American army was no longer a unified unit. The Continental Army was no longer able to fight a conventional army. Instead, Washington decided to focus on the task of fighting the British.

Thus, Washington gathered together the Continental Army and made preparations to invade Boston. But before he could set out, Congressional volunteers from Massachusetts began to join the Continental Army in order to defend their homeland. In the middle of March, the Continental Army attacked Boston, and Washington himself personally led the attack. However, the attack was a failure, and Washington was assassinated on April 19 by a disgruntled man, as he was on his way to Boston to lead the invasion.

Immediately following the crisis, the Continental Army was disbanded, and General Washington was forced to return to Philadelphia. Due to the chaos that resulted from the Revolutionary War, the Continental Army did not take part in the 1783 elections.

The French Connection

Shortly after the Revolution, the Continental Army was disbanded and many of its soldiers became embroiled in a scandal. The Continental Army was accused of being a French puppet, and the army itself became infiltrated by French spies. Many of the soldiers who had joined the Continental Army were accused of being traitors, and many were executed.

The French Connection was discovered and the army was disbanded, but soon after, it became clear that the Continental Army was a French-American front. Many of the soldiers who had joined the Continental Army were accused of being traitors, and many were executed.

(CNN) In one of the biggest and most detailed court filings in decades, the US government is seeking to force Apple to help it unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.

The court filing Wednesday was made in California federal court in San Bernardino, where the government's lawyers have asked a judge to order Apple to create software tools that would enable the government to crack the phone's password.

The government isn't seeking access to the phone itself -- but instead is asking Apple to help it bypass its protection on a laptop computer, the government said. The request by the FBI includes a list of iPhone models of which it says the iPhone 5C is one.

In a landmark court filing Tuesday, Apple argued that the government's request for a backdoor would set a dangerous precedent.

"It would set a dangerous precedent requiring technology companies to weaken their own products for the government's use, with the inevitable result that criminals and terrorists will have access to stronger means to commit their crimes," Apple wrote in its filing

The problem with that narrative is that it ignores the reality that black baby boomers are not a monolithic group, and that we aren't all voting for the same thing.

But when it comes to the question of biracial parents, the narrative is still the same: we voted for the wrong candidate.

A recent poll by YouGov, a British polling company, found that only one-quarter of black respondents think their children will be better off financially following the election of the first black president.

It's important to remember that YouGov is a big-tent polling company, and is not a political tracker.

But it's still interesting that only one-quarter of the black respondents think that their children will be better off, when black mothers are much more likely to be the primary breadwinner in a household.

And it's not like black mothers can't find jobs.

In fact, a recent study by the Center for American Progress found that black women who have college degrees are more likely to be employed than black women without college degrees.

In a 2014 report, the Center for American Progress estimated that black mothers are the primary breadwinner in 33 percent of black families in the US.

When you combine these percentages with the fact that black women are more likely to work and be at or near the top of their professions, it's certainly plausible that black women who think their children will be better off financially due to the election of a black president might be critical of this past election.

But there's a problem with this narrative that we have to consider.

The problem with the black baby boom

If you ask black people about the black baby boom, the first thing you'll hear is that it was a "historic" event, and that it was a time when black people rose to the top.

The optimistic view is that the black baby boom was the result of black people's incredible economic growth and strength during the civil rights movement.

But this narrative ignores the reality of the situation: a small portion of the black population had a very high level of education.

The black baby boom is a much less dramatic story.

In the early 1980s, the US had the highest level of black employment in US history. The unemployment rate for African-Americans was virtually nonexistent.

But then, during the 1980s, the economy began to slow down, and the black unemployment rate began to rise.

Why? Because it was not a time when black people were doing well in terms of economic growth.

The problem, according to the economic historian Charles Murray, is that black people had never had a strong middle class before the civil rights movement.

A growing middle class was the result of a strong union movement, and the rising demand for higher wages.

"The black middle class in America has been an illusion," Murray said in a recent interview with NPR. "What we have long known is that blacks have been systematically denied the rights and opportunities that would allow them to have that middle class."

Pre-civil rights laws

So why did a large chunk of the black population participate in the civil rights movement?

According to the economist Charles Murray, the reason was simple.

"The civil rights movement was really about the black middle class," Murray said in a recent interview with NPR. "The civil rights movement was about providing the black middle class with the opportunity to achieve a middle class life."

The civil rights movement gave black people the opportunity to achieve a middle class life.

The civil rights movement was an opportunity to get a good job, secure a home, get married, and start a family.

But the civil rights movement was also an opportunity to start

It's easy to forget that Sony's PlayStation 4 launched back in November 2013, and Microsoft's Xbox One was launched just two years prior in November 2012.

The console wars have been raging for years, with each side claiming to be the most powerful and best-looking. Both have also been accused of stealing bandwidth from other gamers, with Microsoft's Xbox One being accused of "throttling" games.

However, as we've already noticed, the PlayStation 4 is still more powerful than the Xbox One. And it doesn't seem like Microsoft has any plans to change that.

Speaking with IGN, Microsoft's corporate vice president of worldwide studios, Phil Spencer, took the opportunity to discuss how the Xbox One is perceived to be superior to the PlayStation 4.

"We're not going to change our approach because of the criticism. We're going to do what's right for the platform. We're not going to go backwards or sideways. We're going to do what's right for Microsoft. We're not going to go backwards or sideways. We're going to do what's right for Microsoft's platform."

Spencer also said that the Xbox One is "very good. It's a fantastic piece of hardware," but added that it's "not a game changer."

"We've got a great console. It's very good. It's a fantastic piece of hardware," Spencer said. "It is not a game changer. It's not going to help you push the boundaries of what you can do in games."

"That's what we're doing. We're always going to keep pushing the boundaries."

For more on the Xbox One, be sure to check out our Xbox One review, in which we give the Xbox One a 9/10 rating and give it 4/5 stars out of five.

The Xbox One is available now for £429.99.<|endoftext|>I'm having a problem that is going for days now and I thought I'd post about it here. I've been mining with a GPU for a month now and I've been having problems with getting the GPU temperature in the bottom right corner of the screen to ever go below 33-35 degrees Celsius. The GPU usually goes up to around 50C, but it's been down around 40C for the last month. I've made a few backups of my data and everything in the system seems to be fine, so I'm losing hope. My CPU also seems to be suffering from the same issue.

I've checked the fan speed and the fan is running at around 200%, but the temperature is fine. I've been restarting the computer a few times to get it to correct itself, but I'm still waiting for the temperatures to go down.

I've been using a Corsair H100i, which is a good heatsink but its fan is not powerful enough to dissipate heat, so I've been looking for a cooler. I've been looking at the NH-L9i, which is a budget heatsink by NZXT, but it only comes with a single fan, while the Corsair H100i has two fans.

I've been using my reference Nvidia GTX 980 Ti with a custom BIOS. I've been getting an average of about 60-70 fps with the game running at maximum settings at 1080p with everything maxed out. I've tried overclocking the card on my own and the performance is still not there. I've been using an SSD (Crucial M500) and have been using the latest drivers from Nvidia for the Nvidia drivers (I'm on the 381.85 drivers).

I've not been able to find any other people with the same problem and I'm going to have to go back to my old rig to look at my settings and try to figure out what's going on.

UPDATE: I've done a full backup of my data and everything seems to be fine now.

UPDATE 2: I've been trying to get the temperatures down to about 32 degrees Celsius, but it's not working. I'm going to have to build a new PC and have it shipped to me. It's just not working. I'm going to have to try to find a better solution.

UPDATE 3: Everything seems to be fine now. I've been messing with the fan settings and I have a custom NVidia drivers from NVidia that come with it. I'm going to try to get the temperatures down to 30-32 degrees Celsius and see if it fixes the problem.

The first model of a new high-speed train, the Moscow-to-Ulan-Bator line, is seen at a railway station in Ulan Bator, Mongolia, March 25, 2017. REUTERS/Erlendur Haraldsson

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Russia hasmore than half of the world's rail travel demand, with China the biggest investor, a senior company official said, as it aims to boost the country's booming infrastructure sector, which is already the world's biggest.

Russia is keen to boost its economy by generating international trade and investment, but worries about the impact of Western sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine conflict are making it more cautious than it used to be.

Russia is planning to invest $2 trillion over the next 15 years in its railways, and is borrowing heavily to fund a huge rebuilding program that includes the construction of new rolling stock and signalling systems.

China is the world's biggest investor in rail and is currently the biggest market for Russian railway equipment, but its appetite for the industry could grow as its own infrastructure is expanded, the head of a state-owned Russian rail firm said.

"China is a big player. We have a lot of things in common with China, like infrastructure, and a lot of railways," Ruslan Zakharov, chief executive officer of the state-owned Russian Railways, told Reuters at a visit to Mongolia in October.

"So China is our biggest market, and the biggest investor. We have a joint project with them to build a high-speed line between Moscow and Ulan Bator, so we expect that to be a major project for China."

It is not clear how much Chinese investment in the project, which would be the world's fastest when it is finished in 2026, would be, but Zakharov said it would be "many times" what Russian investors were spending.

China has a huge appetite for Russian rail equipment, with the world's second-biggest economy more than doubling its rail investment over the past decade.

Zakharov said Russia was ready to cooperate with China on projects in Mongolia and beyond, but warned that it was important to avoid complacency.

"We should not be complacent and we should not be convinced that we are already in the very top ranks," he said.

"I might say that China is the biggest investor in Russia currently, but we don't have a lot of infrastructure in Russia yet, so I would not say that China is the best investor to invest in Russia."

Zakharov said Russia's infrastructure was in need of repairs and expansion, and that the country could not rely on China alone.

"We don't need to rely on China alone, we need to work with other countries that invest in this industry, like Germany and the United States," he said.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT

Russia has the world's largest rail network, with 1,925 km (1,196 miles) of track, but has not built much since the Soviet era.

Russia plans to invest more than $60 billion in its railways over the next 15 years, and its spending has increased by 70 percent in the past five years, according to Zakharov.

However, Russia is struggling to raise the money for such an ambitious project, and has faced resistance from several foreign investors who fear they could be discriminated against by Russian railways.

In October, Russian rail operator Rusagro said it had secured $8 billion in financing to build a high-speed rail line connecting Moscow and St. Petersburg.

But it has not announced any new projects in Russia, while other companies, including China's CNR Corp and state-owned oil firm Rosneft, are also involved in high-speed rail projects.

Russia has also been looking for ways to boost its infrastructure, after being hit with sanctions from the west over its involvement in the Ukraine crisis.

The country is planning to build a new bridge across the Dnieper River, which has previously been blocked by a dispute over Ukraine's repayment of a $3 billion loan from Moscow.

However, it faces competing demands for this project from China and India, which are trying to build their own new "Bridge of the Gods" across the river in neighbouring Kazakhstan.

With a budget of $1.1 trillion, the Russian railway sector is the world's fifth-largest, with Chinese investors the world's largest.

China's rail investment in Russia in 2016 was $6.5 billion, according to a report from consultancy firm Rhodium Group.

Zakharov also said Russia had a plan to build high-speed rail between Moscow and Kazan, which is in the country's east, in the next 15 years.

"We have plans for a high-speed line between Moscow and Kazan, that will be built in the next

Posted 14 August 2018 by John Farrell

The 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV is a radical electric car with a range of 238 miles. It can drive itself from LA to San Francisco or from New York to Detroit, at speeds of up to 80 mph. It will be priced at $37,495 before state and federal incentives.

Today Chevrolet announced the Bolt EV will be available in late 2019. The Bolt EV will be built at GM's Orion Assembly Plant in Orion Township, Michigan, and will be delivered to customers in late 2019. GM had earlier announced that its Bolt EV would be rolled out in the second half of 2018.

The Bolt EV is designed for the urban commuter, with a level of safety that exceeds any other electric car on the market today.

In February, Chevrolet said it will expand the Bolt EV's range to 200 miles, the first production electric car to offer that range.

The Bolt EV is GM's first-ever mid-size car with a range of more than 200 miles. It is the company's most aggressive electric car yet, offering a range of about 238 miles.

The Bolt EV is also the first electric car from a major automaker to be priced below $40,000.

A bigger version of the Bolt EV will be available later this year, with a 238-mile range. The Bolt EV will start at around $36,500 before incentives and tax credits.

In the US, the Bolt EV is expected to be on sale from late 2019 through 2020, when it will be replaced by the all-new Chevrolet Bolt.

It sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but this is a reality — and it has scientists scratching their heads.

The high altitude ballooning project is being conducted by the European Space Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In near total secrecy, the project is being conducted in a remote area of the Nevada desert between the towns of Organ Pipe and Ely and the Utah border.

The balloon will travel at an altitude of about 50,000 feet (15,000 meters) above the Earth, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) away from the nearest inhabited land area. The balloon will travel for a period of about 18 months.

Weirdly, that's not the case. Conservatives are overrepresented in the ranks of the Republican Party, but they still lack the numbers to control the government.

In this year's election, the party that won the most votes in the last presidential election (that is to say, the party that won the most votes in all the states) was the Republican Party. But it did not win a majority of the seats in the House of Representatives. Instead, the Republicans came up just three seats short of a majority.

The reason these three Republicans, John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and Kevin McCarthy, were able to take control of both houses of Congress is that of course, they are all conservatives and they are all anti-choice.

But if this were just about abortion, you would expect conservative extremism to produce an outlier result. However, in the case of Congress, the numbers tell a different story.

According to exit polls, the most common issue among Republicans is "the economy" (38 percent), followed by "government" (28 percent), "big Government" (26 percent), "immigration" (24 percent), and "terrorism" (20 percent).

By contrast, Democrats were more likely to prioritize "health care" (45 percent), "education" (39 percent), "jobs and the economy" (37 percent), "foreign policy" (33 percent), "environment" (26 percent), and "terrorism" (25 percent).

So, Democrats are very much in favor of social services, while the Republicans are more inclined toward economic growth.

The reason for this shift is that, while economic growth does yield improved health outcomes, it does not necessarily lead to more social services. In fact, in the era of Ronald Reagan, the Republican Party embraced social conservatism, as a means of winning the White House.

In the 1980s, the Republican Party was the only major political party to offer generous tax cuts to the wealthy, a signature issue for Ronald Reagan.

Reagan, however, was not a fan of social programs, and so his administration, which coming from the right, was ideologically opposed to social programs. The result of this was that Reagan's administration was a disaster for the poor and working class, as the poor were disproportionately harmed by the economic policies of the administration.

According to a recent study, "the net effect of the Reagan tax cuts on poor families was to reduce spending by $1,600 in 1985, and $2,000 in 1988, and $3,200 in 1993. Families with incomes below the poverty line saw an average benefit decline of $1,800. The greatest impact was felt by families with income between 100 percent and 200 percent of poverty. Benefits were cut by $3,300 in 1987 and $4,400 in 1993. Families in the second income quintile (between $100,000 and $200,000) saw an average benefit decline of $4,100 in 1987 and $6,400 in 1993."

Despite being opposed to social programs, however, the Republicans still managed to win the White House.

The real lesson here is that the "populist" agenda of the Republicans was a disaster for the poor and working class. The American public is not fundamentally opposed to social programs, and Democrats are not more inclined toward social services than Republicans.

The Democrats will not be able to control the public if they pursue a populist agenda.

The concept of a post-racial America has been around for quite a while. But it has gained momentum in the last five years, with the election of Barack Obama as President of the United States (2008). The notion of a post-racial America has also gained currency with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.

However, the notion of a post-racial America has a lot of road to travel. It is one of the most difficult concepts to grasp, and it is also one of the most controversial. In this article, I will attempt to

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is gaining traction and trading volume, and Bitcoin Cash is quickly becoming the new main cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin Cash is gaining the attention of the media and the community and many people are very excited about it. Several projects are being developed for Bitcoin Cash, and some of them are really interesting.

Bcoin

Bcoin is a fork of Bitcoin which was developed by the Bcoin team. Bcoin is an open source project, and it is being developed by the community.

The team is currently preparing for an upcoming Hard Fork which will take place on September 13, 2017. A Hard Fork is a hard fork that is required to increase the blocksize limit in order to accommodate higher transaction volumes.

The hard fork will allow the network to process more transactions, and it will reduce the block size to 8 MB. This will speed up transaction confirmation times, and the transaction fees will also be lower.

A number of other improvements are also being prepared for Bcoin. A new protocol is being prepared and it will allow for more efficient use of the blockchain. A number of improvements will also be implemented to increase the scalability and performance of the network.

The Bcoin team is also planning to develop a Bitcoin Cash wallet. The wallet is expected to be launched as soon as possible.

The 'P' in 'Pee-wee Herman' is for the word 'Pee-wee.' He has the perfect name for a character who is a bit of a goofball. He has the perfect name for a character who is a bit of a goofball.

'Pee-wee Herman' is about as real as a character that comes out of a cartoon can get.

For starters, he's actually a real person -- a real-life man named Pee-wee Herman.

"A character like that is very easy to make up," Pee-wee said.

The P in 'Pee-wee Herman' is for the word 'Pee-wee.' He has the perfect name for a character who is a bit of a goofball. He has the perfect name for a character who is a bit of a goofball.

"I just wanted to play a guy who was a character," Pee-wee said.

Who can forget the scene in "Pee-wee's Big Adventure" where the classic man of action helps a youngster get his first bicycle?

"No, no, no, no, no, no," Pee-wee Herman said. "I'm not here to ride a bicycle. I'm here to ride a horse."

Pee-wee Herman never forgot that scene, and he's never forgotten the kid who wanted to ride a bicycle.

"I thought, hey, if I put a horse in the movie, he will have to go on a lot of rides," Pee-wee said. "But I had a real horse, a real pony, so I said, 'No, no, no."

Pee-wee Herman thought a real horse would be the perfect ride for a kid in the 'Pee-wee' movies.

"The horse just has to have a lot of energy, and the horse has to have a lot of personality," Pee-wee said.

At least a bit of personality. The best part about a real horse is that they're just like Pee-wee Herman.

"They're a lot like me, and they're a lot like you," Pee-wee Herman said.

Pee-wee Herman is a real man, just like the character he plays in the 'Pee-wee' movies.

"You can't be a little old man and ride a horse," Pee-wee Herman said.

Pee-wee Herman is able to laugh at himself because he grew up in the 'Pee-wee' movies. He even has a story about the time he got into a fight with his father.

"I got into a fight with my father," Pee-wee Herman said. "I was a really young kid, and he was driving me around in a limo. He was driving the limo, and I was stupid. He was driving the limo, and he hit me, and my horse bit me, and he broke my hand."

Pee-wee Herman's horse broke his hand, and he had to go to the hospital.

"I said, 'Boy, I gotta go to the hospital, but you gotta go with me.' And he said, 'I don't want to go with you, I want to leave you here.'"

Pee-wee Herman's horse bit his hand, and he had to go to the hospital.

"My horse bit my hand, and I had to go to the hospital, and I said, 'I gotta go to the hospital, but you gotta go with me,'" Pee-wee Herman said. "And he said, 'I don't want to go with you, I want to leave you here.'"

Pee-wee Herman's horse, who he named Ami, broke his hand, and he had to go to the hospital.

"He had to go to the hospital, and I had to go to the hospital, and we got married," Pee-wee Herman said.

Pee-wee Herman has a real life wife, Victoria, who is from the same town as him in Illinois.

"I've got friends all over the country. I've been married like 15 times," Pee-wee Herman said.

Pee-wee Herman has been married at least 15 times, and he is a father of two daughters.

"Hopefully, I'll have a little girl in the next few years," Pee-wee Herman said.

LAS VEGAS – Chris "CM Punk" Punk has yet to address the TMZ report that he was denied medical treatment at the WWE Performance Center.

Punk was pulled from a Monday Night Raw match against Brock Lesnar at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, WWE officials said.

The incident occurred as Lesnar was about to walk off the mat to face Punk. After a short exchange, Lesnar and Punk locked up, and Lesnar tossed Punk to the floor.

Punk, who suffered what was described as a concussion in the fight, was being evaluated by WWE doctors and an independent doctor.

In a statement, WWE said it is "aware of the issue and is investigating." Lesnar's manager told TMZ that Lesnar was not injured in the fall, and he was not in the ring when the incident occurred.

Lesnar has not commented publicly on the issue.

"I just can't imagine what he's going through," Punk said Monday night at the WWE Tribute to the Troops event in Las Vegas. "And I hope he's okay. I hope he's getting better, and I hope we get to see him back on The Grandest Stage of Them All soon. But right now, I'm just focused on getting better and getting back to the ring. I'm going to be fine. I'm going to be back."

The condition of Punk remained unclear Monday night. He was taken to the hospital by ambulance, according to the WWE.

Punk tweeted Monday night that he had been cleared from the hospital.

@WWE It's my understanding that I'm fine now. Thanks to everyone for their thoughts and prayers. — Chris Punk (@WWERomanPunk) September 21, 2015

Shapiro wasn't the only one declaring that the NSA has been lying about its dragnet surveillance.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has gone on record saying that it too is concerned about the NSA's privacy dragnet.

"We are concerned that the government has used Section 215 to collect information on millions of Americans' phone calls, and we are concerned that the government is collecting more information about people than it is telling the public," said Jameel Jaffer, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU.

Jaffer said the problem is twofold: First, the NSA is collecting and storing the phone records of millions of Americans. So far, they have been using the metadata to make sophisticated investigations into terrorism and other criminal activity.

Second, the NSA is not telling the public how it is doing it.

"As far as we can tell, the government is not telling anyone what it is doing with the information it is collecting," Jaffer said.

The ACLU published a new report today, which points to a number of other examples of the NSA flagrantly lying to the public about the extent of its surveillance programs.

The report details how the NSA has been claiming that it does not have the ability to search through its communications intelligence databases without a warrant. But the ACLU found that the NSA is in fact able to search through its databases with no warrant. The ACLU also found that the NSA has admitted that it has been collecting geographic data about a significant number of Americans.

The ACLU also found evidence of NSA data mining that it says only confirms the abuses revealed by Snowden.

"The NSA's secrecy also gives the agency a veil of secrecy to hide its activities from the public," Jaffer said.

"We are deeply concerned that the government is no longer protecting the privacy of American's communications," Jaffer said. "We believe that the public needs to know the extent to which the NSA collects, stores and manages Americans' communications."

The ACLU has been trying to educate Congress about the NSA's abuse of its powers, but the lawmakers still have not acted to rein in the agency.

"We are certainly trying to get the attention of Congress to ask them to hold hearings, to take action, to do something," Jaffer said.

"There is a lot of evidence that the NSA is using Section 215 of the Patriot Act to collect bulk phone records, and we believe that the public needs to know this," Jaffer said.<|endoftext|>I Love You, Daddy is a comedy about a father who is being stalked by his own son.

It was a sort-of experiment in vehicle automation, and the project was a failure. It was also the inspiration for the more successful DARPA-funded Hyperloop.

It's also the inspiration for a new light rail system in Greater Los Angeles.

The project is called LA Metro Rail, and it's supposed to be the most advanced light rail system in the US.

And it's coming to LA in 2024.

So it's time for an update.

The light rail line, which is being funded by the Federal Transit Administration and the state of California, will extend from the San Fernando Valley to the San Fernando Valley/Glendale border.

The idea is to create a sort of "superhighway" around LA. It will connect the Valley to the Valley, and the Valley to the Valley. It will connect the Valley to the Valley and the Valley and the Valley.

The current plan calls for a 16-mile ribbon of light rail, with six stations, at a cost of $2.8 billion.

Here's a video from the LA Metro website showing how a typical trip will be:

It will be totally electric, with a maximum speed of 65 mph, with a theoretical maximum of 95 mph.

The rails will be able to take cars and passengers as far as the Valley and Glendale, but don't expect to travel much beyond that.

And it will have only one lane — two left-hand turns.

Unlike its predecessor, the new light rail will be

The newest addition to the BIP 0032 list is an easy-to-use 'dumb' chain-link fence that should prove to be a very useful tool for any application.

The BIP explains ChainLinkFence and how it works in detail.

The first problem that I see with the above diagram is that the chains are not evenly spaced. While this is perfectly okay at the edges of your chain link fence, it is not acceptable at your fence's center. The reason is that if the chains are not evenly spaced, then they will be able to 'peel' each other off your fence. For example, let's look at the diagram again.

In the above diagram, the chains were not evenly spaced. The spacing of the chains is an issue at the fence's center, where they will be able to peel off each other.

A ChainLinkFence is easy to construct and quick to set up. It is also super cheap. All you need to do is lay out a pair of 2x4s, cut them down to about 4 feet, and then staple it up. It takes about 15 minutes to build the fence. It is also very strong and is able to keep the chain links apart.

The final feature of chain link fences is that they can be easily longed with hardware. The starting point is the chain link fence itself, cut 2x4s to the length you need. Staple the 2x4s into the fence. The fence then simply needs to be extended with hardware. If the hardware is long enough, it is easily extended to extend the fence. The hardware should be long enough that the chain links will stay apart in the end.

As mentioned before, the chain link fence is not the only thing that BIP 0032 addresses.

BIP 0032 also addresses the following issues:

0x01 – Chain LinkFence requires both sides of the fence to be anchored to the ground, which cannot be done with the current generation of chain link fences.

I have a very deep connection with my ancestors and I feel that I am doing them a favor by being here today. It is also a privilege to be here with you.

My Grandmother, Nellie Mae, was a very spiritual woman. She had a very intimate connection with God. She would say, "We have to go to the Spirit World." She would pray to God and he would come. Her last words to me before she passed away were, "You are my last hope."

I was fortunate to grow up in a religious household and I grew up in a religious home. I was taught to believe in God. I was taught God loved me and that God would provide for me. I felt that my parents were there for me. I had a lot of faith in God.

My Mom and Dad were very good to me. They taught me to eat right and to exercise. They were good to me, but they were very strict. They also wanted me to be a good student.

My Dad had a hard time with school. He had a lot of anger issues. He never really got good grades, he always had bad grades. I don't know why he was so angry. He would just get angry at the world.

I remember the last time I saw my dad. He was in the hospital and he was in a lot of pain. I was worried about him. I remember when I went to see him, I asked the nurses if he was going to make it. They said, "No, he's going to die."

He actually passed away before I got home. He was in a coma, but he woke up and he was still in a coma. They had a feeding tube in him. My Mom and Dad were going to operate on him, but they couldn't do it.

I remember going to my Mom's and crying. I remember my Mom saying, "Don't be sad, we are going to take care of him." I remember going to my Dad's room and crying. I can still remember him telling me that God had taken him to Heaven and that he was going to be okay.

I remember going to see my Grandmother in the hospital. She told me, "Nellie Mae, we are going to take care of him." I remember crying. I remember her telling me, "He is going to be fine. He loves you."

I remember being in the hospital. My Grandmother asked me, "How are your parents?" I said, "They are okay."

I was worried that my Dad would die. I was worried that I would be alone. I remember when I was in the hospital, I went to see my Mom. I told her, "I have to go home." I asked her, "What are you going to do?" She said, "Go home, you have to go home." I said, "What do you mean 'go home'?" She said, "Your dad is gone." I said, "What do I do now?" She said, "You have to walk on. You have to walk on." I said, "What do I do now?" She said, "You have to walk on. You have to walk on."

The White House has final approval for 18 different types of ammunition, including bullets, bullets with a kinetic energy rating of more than 800 joules and ballistic tip rounds, according to a document obtained by Fox News.

The list of ammunition is seen as a troubling sign for the National Rifle Association, which has long supported a ban on bullets with a kinetic energy rating of more than 300 joules.

A spokesperson for the White House did not return a request for comment from Fox News.

The President's Daily Briefing, which is delivered to the President each morning, is the document that contains the most controversial information. The document requires the President to sign off on all types of ammunition, including "subsonic, sonic, kinetic energy, and general-purpose and special purpose" ammunition.

The ammunition is not classified and can be purchased online or at retail stores. They are often used for target practice and hunting.

The administration has been trying to reduce the number of bullets that go off in the hands of civilians for years. While the Obama administration has seen a decrease in the number of gun deaths, the number of people shot with bullets is still rising, according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The NRA has long been against the ban on bullets with a kinetic energy rating of more than 300 joules.

In January, the White House released a list of 22 different types of ammunition that were approved for purchase.

The list includes bullets and rounds that the ATF has determined to be legal in the United States. It does not reflect the "restricted" ammunition that cannot be purchased or possessed, as required by law.


The list is also not in alphabetical order, according to the document. It's unclear how the White House determined which types of ammunition were on the list, but the list contains numerous bullets that are not included in the ATF's list.

The White House document shows the types of ammunition that the Administration is willing to approve for purchase.

The document shows a number of rounds that the ATF has determined to be legal in the United States, including 9mm hollow point, .40 S&W and .45 ACP bullets.

The list also includes "special purpose" ammunition, which are specific types of ammunition that the ATF has determined are not specifically banned in the United States.

The White House document lists 9mm bullets.

The list also includes the following types of ammunition:

-.223 caliber bullets

The movie, which is kind of funny but also kind of sad, featured a young man who was (eventually) killed in a car crash. While in a coma, he was visited by his father, who told him, "This is what you have wanted to know. You wanted to know what it is that makes a man a man." Very succinct, and very important.

We all have a father figure, and we all want to know what it is that makes a man a man. What is it about being a man that we all desire? Batman is a man who has been through so much. He has been through the death of his parents, the loss of his mentor, and the loss of all that he loved. He has tried to destroy the criminal element, but has not succeeded. He has tried to be a better person, but has not succeeded. He has tried to be a hero, but has not succeeded. He has been through all of these things and has come out the other side as a hero. He has been through it all and has a very good idea of what makes a man a man.

So, how would Batman respond to the question, "What makes a man a man?"

I think that Batman would

Shedding light on the trolley problem—the challenge of designing and operating automated transit systems such as the ones that have come to dominate the U.S. transit landscape—a new urban research paper authored by a group of researchers at the University of California, Davis, describes how to make a trolley system more efficient.

Caltrain, the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and San Francisco's Muni all use a type of traction power that consists of two overhead wires that form an alternating current of electric current. This type of power can be used to push the vehicle forward in a straight line, but it can also be used to push the car sideways when the rails are curved. The researchers found that in these cases, the electricity could be used to generate a different kind of power, one that is used to push the car sideways.

"If you think about a trolley, the traction power is being used to push the trolley sideways," said Greg Smith, a former postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and one of the paper's co-authors. "Then you have a bunch of wires going around the wheel, and you have to take care of the wire resistance, the capacitance of the wires, and the inductance of the connection to keep the wheel from slipping back and forth. So if we could somehow put that power to work, we could use it to power the wheels of the trolley sideways. That's a really neat effect, but we don't know how to do it."

Smith and co-author Ashok Mishra, who is now at the University of Illinois at Chicago, analyzed data from the California-based California High Speed Rail Authority's Project Connect, which analyzed the performance of 20 different traction power types on a trolley.

For their study, the researchers measured the power drawn by a trolley vehicle driven in a straight line at various speeds. They found that the power consumption for a vehicle driven in a straight line at speeds between 1 and 5 mph was roughly the same at all four traction power types.

But when the researchers compared the power consumption of a vehicle driven at different speeds in a curved path, they found that the power consumption of the trolley at the maximum speed the vehicle could travel was 10% higher at the traction power used in the curved path. The researchers did not find this effect when the trolley was driven at the maximum speed the vehicle could travel.

To understand how the researchers were able to observe this effect, the researchers believe that the traction power used in the curved path was actually pulling the car sideways, which would have a similar effect as the wire resistance of a straight path.

"What we've been able to show is that there's a different type of power that could be used to pull a trolley sideways," Smith said. "If the traction power was used as a generator, the energy density of that power would be very, very high, so we would get much higher power per unit of mass. If the traction power is used as an inverter, it would be much harder for the trolley to slip sideways. It would be harder for the traction power to have a negative effect on the vehicle, which is what we see when we look at the data."

Brown University Professor Joseph Pribus, who also worked at the University of California, Davis on this project, said the results represent some of the first detailed analysis of the trolley problem—an important one, he said, because the research helps to substantiate a proposal that has been kicking around for years to replace some of the traction power currently used by BART and Muni with alternative power sources.

"I think what this paper does is to say that we need to think about how to use trolley technology for something other than just moving people," said Pribus. "Trolley design has been a good illustration of technology improving how we move people around. The problem is that the technology is becoming really good at moving people around, and it's becoming really good at moving people around in a specific configuration. All of a sudden, you have to start thinking about how to use it differently in different situations."

Mishra and Smith have filed a patent on their idea, but they have not yet received any funding to pursue it.

"This paper is a first step toward the next step," Pribus said. "There may be other pathways to go on. It's kind of a proof of concept, but I think this paper is an important step toward a patent."<|endoftext|>To see the collection of prior postings to the list, visit the archive .

Fondly known as the 'Bolshevik's new toy', the AK-74U is the latest Russian assault rifle to be introduced into the line-up.

Manufactured by the Russian arms manufacturer Magpul Industries, the AK-74U is an inexpensive and reliable assault rifle that is widely used by police forces across the globe. Over the years, the AK-74U has transformed from a specialist rifle in the Soviet Union to an affordable and reliable rifle in the Russian Federation.

The newest version of the AK-74, the AK-74U, has a receiver-mounted folding stock and a Picatinny rail on the receiver that can be fitted with a variety of accessories.

The AK-74U is also one of the most reliable assault rifles available today. The rifle is produced with high-quality components, and the modular design and the use of interchangeable parts ensures that the rifle will not break down.

The AK-74U offers a number of reliability improvements over its predecessors, including the use of a bolt lock and a gas system that allows for a faster cycle rate and a more consistent shot.

The AK-74U also uses an ambidextrous safety/fire selector. The safety, which is operated by the right-hand side of the shooter's hand, is used to engage the bolt carrier group when it is locked back during the firing cycle. The firing selector is used to select either semi-automatic or full-automatic fire.

The AK-74U is also available with a detachable box magazine. The magazine is compatible with 30-round and 45-round clips. The AK-74U can be fired in 5.45x39mm and 7.62x39mm calibres.<|endoftext|>A 26-year-old man has been charged with the murder of his 11-year-old neighbour after a violent melee at a Bradford estate.

Luke Hamilton, of Bultley Close, was arrested on suspicion of murder after a post mortem examination on his relative found cuts and bruises that were consistent with the boy's injuries.

The boy was hit by a bottle and stabbed in the chest and arm on Wednesday night because he had run into a neighbour's garden.

He died in hospital on Thursday.

The boy's mother, who has not been named, said the attack started when she returned home and saw the boy was bleeding.

She said: "He was running out of the house and my son asked him to put his shoes on.

"Luke then smacked the boy across the top of the head. He then told the boy to get in the car and told me to get him the ambulance."

The mother said her son had been hit with a bottle and stabbed in the chest and arm. His injuries were consistent with a bottle being thrown at him.

She said: "He was being hit in the head with a bottle and he had injuries at the bottom of his legs. I think it was a bottle thrown at him.

"I thought he was dead. I had to wait for the ambulance until it got here because my son had been bleeding to death."

The boy's father said he had been watching the argument between his son and Hamilton in his garden on Wednesday night.

He said: "I saw the boy trying to get home and I ran to him. It was just a normal argument between a boy and his father.

"The boy had run down the road to the garden and he had been attacked by Luke and the other man.

"I tried to stop the fight. I went to the police and police got there and took over.

"When they got there they said he was dead."

Detective Constable Andy Croft, of Greater Manchester Police, said: "We have charged a 26-year-old man with murder following a violent incident last night in Bradford.

"The investigation is at an early stage and no further details are available at this stage.

"The boy's family have been informed of the charge."

The nightly news has been flooded with the topic, and the topic is so over-the-top, so over-the-top, so over-the-top, it feels like an epidemic.

From the Daily Mail to CNN, the entire media establishment is on the exact same page: Fake news is our biggest problem. And Donald Trump is to blame.

We do not know for certain that Trump is a fake news maneater. But he has made it clear that he finds the very idea absurd.

So the question is, what is fake news?

I'm not sure I have a great answer. I think the definition of fake news is a matter of opinion and I don't really care.

But my sense is, if you want to fight fake news, you have to fight a different kind of fake news.

This is the kind of fake news that Trump has repeatedly promoted, and it is the kind of fake news that's reached fever pitch on Twitter.

The reason this is so dangerous is that it encourages people to believe anything that fits their narrative. And it makes it easier for them to be duped.

Here's a simple example: When I first started writing about these issues in 2009, I thought most people were willfully ignorant.

But as I read more about the issues, I discovered that most people were not willfully ignorant. They were governed by facts. They were not willfully ignorant, but they were governed by facts.

So what was the difference?

The difference was that most people knew what the facts were.

We are now living in a world where facts are being ignored. And if people can't find them, they are not going to believe them.

This has been going on for years. But it has accelerated massively since Trump's election.

The media seems to be obsessed with this issue. The latest example was the New York Times's story about the "fake news" that people are giving the president.

Here's the thing. They are right.

The Trump administration has been pushing a misleading, and in some cases flat-out false, narrative about the opioid crisis.

The narrative has been so focused on the opioid crisis that it has ignored other issues that are more important to the lives of people who actually live in these areas.

The Times report about the fake news is peppered with this:

But he has also used his Twitter account to promote falsehoods, from the campaign to the presidency and from the Oval Office to the stage.

The New York Times is right. There is a lot of fake news out there.

But it is not the same thing as fake news.

If you are a news organization that wants to know if there is fake news out there, the only way to find out is to investigate.

Everyone else, including people who are trying to make up fake news, is the enemy.

The enemy is a group of people who are not interested in facts, who are not interested in truth, who are not interested in the truth even if they can get it.

If you want to fight fake news, you have to fight this enemy.

You can't fight it by smearing people who share your opinions. You can't fight it by calling them Nazis.

You can't fight it by trying to intimidate people who disagree with you.

You only have a fighting chance if

If you're not a regular reader of my blog, or are new here, please feel free to jump to the bottom of the article to get the basics.

In the previous article, I discussed the basics of the possible options that will be available to me to play the role of the red mage.

This week, I'm going to discuss the pros and cons of them.

Pros & Cons of Fireball & Ice Lance

In my last article, I also discussed that I have a few other options available to me to be red mage, which are Fireball and Ice Lance.

What's the pros and cons of those?

Fireball:

Pros:

It has the highest resource cost (4) in the game, which is certainly an advantage (although not a huge one).

It has a high from cost (7) which makes it a reliable removal spell.

It only costs 2 mana, which I feel is just right for a removal spell.

It is the only spell that can target minions.

It has 2 range (which is good for it's cost)

It has a range of 1, which is also good for it's cost.

It can be used as a 2 damage burn spell.

Ice Lance:

Pros:

It is the cheapest spell in the game.

It has a low cost (4) which is also an advantage.

It has a low from cost (4) which makes it a reliable removal spell.

It only costs 2 mana, which is just right for it's cost.

It allows you to use it as a 2 damage burn spell.

It is the only spell that can target minions.

It has 2 range (which is good for it's cost)

It has a range of 1, which is good for it's cost.

It can be used as a 2 damage burn spell.

Cons:

It has 1 range (which is really bad for it's cost)

It has a range of 1, which means that it can only be used as a 1 damage burn spell.

It cannot remove minions, which is really bad for it's cost.

It can't be used as a burn spell.

It can only be used on an enemy minion.

How to Play a Red Mage

So, how do I play a red mage?

You want to be a low cost (4) mage, and you want to be a control mage.

What this means is that you want to have some cheap removal spells that can destroy minions, and you want to have some cheap spells that can heal your minions.

Having an opponent who is low on health is the easiest way to win, but it's not the only way.

If you played a control mage (which I recommend), you want to keep in mind that players who are low on health will try to use their abilities to kill you, so you want to have a way to get out of it.

This is where Ice Lance comes in. It allows you to remove a minion from the game, and then you can use it as a 2 damage burn spell.

It's also important to note that if you use Ice Lance to destroy a minion, you'll also remove its spell that makes it Immune to Damage.

This is a great way to stop the enemy from killing you.

Ultimately, you want to play a low cost mage, and you want to control the board.

If you can be a control mage, and you can play a low cost mage, you can win almost every game.

It's not only about the cards, it's about the mindset.

You want to be the one controlling the board, and you want to not let your opponent get in the way of it.

Mana boosts are always good for this.

Anytime you're in the middle of a board control struggle, remember to use your mana boosts, and to be aggressive.

When you're playing a control mage, you want to play the game the way that you want to play it, and not let your opponent play the way that they want to play it.

Have fun!

St. Augustine, Florida (CNN) -- The 12-year-old boy who died in the backyard of his Florida home last week had been told to stay inside after a fight with his father, but he sneaked back outside anyway at the last second, according to his father.

The boy had been playing around in the backyard of his home in the town of St. Augustine on July 23 when he was killed by a shotgun blast, police said.

"He shot him in the back," said Lonnie Nix, who witnessed the shooting minutes after his son was hit.

Nix said he and his wife were at home when they heard a gunshot and the sound of a car hitting the porch.

"We were right next door and I saw him die," Nix said.

Nix said he called 911 and ran outside to help. The boy's stepmother, who was also at the home, was also at the scene when the boy was hit, Nix said.

"He had been shot in the back," Nix said.

The boy was rushed to the hospital, where he died.

"It's very sad," Nix said. "I'm just so upset and I just want justice."

The boy's father, who did not want to be identified, said his son was afraid of guns, and his stepmother had tried to get him to comply with the house rules.

"He was obsessed with guns, and he wanted to be a gun owner," the father said. "He was terrified of guns."

The father said his son had been ordered to stay inside after a fight in the backyard of the home, and he had left to get some water to keep him cool. The father said he was disappointed his stepdaughter didn't come home when he came home from work.

"I really want to know why she didn't come back," he said.

The stepmother wasn't home when Nix called police at 9:47 p.m. on July 23.

"She wasn't here ... so we had to call 911 and they arrived a short time later and told me that the boy had been shot," he said. "They told me it was an accident."

Nix said he was told the boy had been found in the yard by a man who was walking by when he saw him running in the yard.

"I told him to call 911 and I got the ambulance right away," Nix said.

The father said he didn't know what could have provoked the incident.

"I hope that whatever happened, it wasn't a crime," he said. "I don't know if he knew his own son was a threat to him at that moment."

Nix said he hopes the boy's death will be a reminder to other parents to call 911 if their children are in danger.

"I hope it will give people the courage to call that dispatcher and not just run away," he said.

He said he is planning to file a lawsuit against the homeowner.<|endoftext|>The government is considering the possibility of closing the door to free movement of people after Brexit, according to a leaked government paper.

The document, entitled "Remain and Leave – the Migrant Impact", was drawn up for the Home Office by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC).

It proposes the government "apply the same rules to the UK as it does to the rest of the EU", and proposes a "period of transitional arrangements" that would allow the UK to "build its own immigration system".

The precise nature of the transitional arrangements is unclear, although the document suggests that the UK's relationship with the EU could be adjusted during the period, effectively leaving the UK without the ability to control immigration from the EU, unless it joined the Euro.

The document describes the transitional arrangements as "a model to be looked at by government in the future".

"The government is considering the potential for a period of transitional arrangements, such as the one that existed in New Zealand in the 1990s," the MAC says.

"We've looked at the model of New Zealand. We've looked at how it works in terms of trade and creating a very open economy. I think we can learn from what they've done."

The EU-UK deal that is required to allow the UK to stay in the single market and customs union, is "not a done deal" according to the MAC, and "may not be possible".

It says: "The government is considering the potential for a period of transitional arrangements, such as the one that existed in New Zealand in the 1990s.

"We've looked at the model of New Zealand. We've looked at how it works in terms of trade and creating a very open economy.

The public has a right to be informed about the company that makes the product they use and the environmental impact of what they use, a federal judge ruled Monday.

The ruling is the latest in a series of rulings that have made it difficult for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to prevent chemical companies from hiding the chemicals they use under the pretense of "trade secrets."

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Eastern District of Texas comes after a lengthy series of appeals by chemical companies. The ruling could set a precedent for other corporate trade secrets and codes of conduct cases.

"If we don't have enough input, this case will be lost," said Susan Herring, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota Department of Environmental Science and Policy. "The public has a right to know what chemicals they are putting into their bodies when they buy a product."

At issue is the chemistry of a class of chemicals called PAHs, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These powerful chemicals are a byproduct of gasoline production and emit carcinogens when they come into contact with air. They have been linked to everything from cancer to asthma.

The EPA has struggled for years to identify and regulate them. In 2008, the agency proposed a list of four chemicals that would be regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Clean Air Act.

The four chemicals were: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. The EPA proposed their names in the letter C, as in "compound, compound named."

The EPA's list was a "proposed list of chemicals to be regulated" under the TSCA and the CAA, said Richard Revesz, an attorney with the law firm Garvey Schubert LLP who successfully defended the EPA's emissions standards from a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council.

The EPA planned to publish the number of chemicals on the list in "pre-publication" form in a newspaper, and call for public comment on the list before publishing it in a journal.

In 2009, the EPA published the list of chemicals in a journal called Science, but only after the chemical industry threatened to sue the agency over the publication. The chemical industry claimed the EPA's announcement was a "trade secret," preventing the EPA from announcing the chemicals' names.

The EPA went ahead and published the list anyway, and in 2010, it published a follow-up report with the same names and the same schedule for public comment.

For five years, the chemical industry and its allies in Congress have sought to block the EPA from publishing the list.

In 2011, the EPA delayed publication of the chemicals on the list until after the 2012 election. The delay was a political move, according to the EPA, since it would have been difficult for the agency to publish the list in time for the 2012 presidential election.

The chemical industry sued the EPA in federal court, arguing the EPA was violating the TSCA and the CAA by publishing the list.

The chemical industry argued that the list should be kept secret because the chemicals in the list are not currently regulated under the CAA or TSCA.

The EPA argued that the chemicals in the list are regulated under the CAA and that the chemicals in the list are not currently regulated under the TSCA. The EPA said that the list would, under the law, be published with the "same prominence as the existing EPA list."

The chemical industry and its allies in Congress argued that the EPA was violating the TSCA and the CAA by publishing the list.

The EPA and the chemical industry reached a settlement in August 2013. The EPA agreed to publish the list, but only after the chemical industry agreed to stop its legal threats against the agency.

Since the settlement, the EPA has published the list under the same schedule as the list it published in 2009.

The EPA has also published the list under the same schedule as the list it published in 2011, but without calling for public comment.

The new version of the list is called the "Expanded Chemical Safety Communication."

The EPA has also published the list under the same schedule as the list it published in 2012, but without calling for public comment.

Now that the EPA is publishing the list under the same schedule as the list it published in 2012, it will be possible to obtain the list online.

The list is available online at http://www.epa.gov/chemicals/chemistry/EPA-Chemical-Safety-Communication-List. The EPA also publishes a PDF version of the list.

Benjamin Mizer, an attorney with the National Resources Defense Council, said the final list is "an improvement" over the 2009 version.

"In my opinion," Mizer said, "this is a good

The Catastrophic Failure of the American Media

In 1958, a group of economists met in London to form a new organization called the International Labour Organization. The purpose of the organization was to bring together all the world's major socialist and communist parties who had agreed to sign an agreement that they would not enter into war. "The League of Nations," the organization's constitution declared, "is an organization for the prevention of war."

The League of Nations was an effort to prevent war, but it failed. The group was never able to agree on a single resolution that would prevent war. Instead, the various parties in the organization rolled over and continued to fight with each other. The League was a failure, but it was not a failure of the concept behind it; rather, it was a failure of the men who led the organization.

While the group in London was unable to prevent war, the American media is in a similar position. Despite the fact that the media has been wholly complicit in the government's war machine, the American media has been unable to prevent the media from becoming a force for wanton destruction. War has been allowed to destroy the lives of millions of people, and the media will not stop.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Islamic State has"taken over" territory in Syria and Iraq and is "being aided" by Turkish intelligence, a leader of the hardline Islamist group said on Tuesday, a day after Ankara shot down a Russian jet on the Syrian border.

Policemen stand near the wreckage of a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 jet after it was shot down by Turkey on the Syrian-Turkish border, near the southeastern town of Akcakale, Hatay province, Turkey, November 24, 2015. REUTERS/Osman Orsal

The comments by Abu al-Khayr al-Masri, a spokesman for the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), were the first publicly reported by the group since the jet was downed on Tuesday.

Two Russian SU-24 planes were shot down by Turkish jets on Tuesday, the first time that has happened since Moscow entered the Syrian war in September, after they violated Turkish airspace for at least 10 minutes.

Turkey said the jets were warned 10 times before they were shot down, and that Russian pilots did not identify themselves.

Syria's government said the planes had been in Syrian airspace for 12 minutes, and that ISIL had used the jet to carry out attacks on Turkmen and other rebels along the border.

The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a group of Syrian pilots had defected to Turkey, and that the two pilots who ejected from the jet were in good health.

A Turkish official said the military had detained two Russian pilots, but gave no details on the reason for their detention.

"We have taken over Iraqi and Syrian territory. The new Islamic State that has taken over, we call them Daesh, is being aided by Turkey. They have weapons, they have ammunition. They are also training our people in planning terror attacks in Turkey," Masri said in a statement.

The Islamist group has lost some of its strongholds in Syria and Iraq to a U.S.-backed coalition of Arab and Kurdish fighters who are trying to oust ISIL from its self-declared caliphate.

Masri also said the group's Syrian branch, previously known as the Nusra Front, was considering an alliance with al Qaeda to fight the Syrian government.

The Nusra Front was designated a terrorist organization in September by the United States and its European allies, and the group has become increasingly isolated from mainstream rebel groups.

The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is one of the most powerful groups among the many rebel factions fighting Assad's government, and has gained ground in recent weeks.

Syria's ambassador to Russia, Riad Haddad, said on Tuesday that Russia would not prevent the Syrian government from "fighting terrorists".

"If they want to fight terrorism and not Syria's army, they should fight terrorists and not the Syrian army," Haddad said.

U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday urged Russia to support a political solution to Syria's civil war, but said there was no military solution to the conflict.

While American officials have said that ISIL is likely losing ground in the battle for Syria, they have also said that it is still an active and dangerous threat to the region.<|endoftext|>By Mose Buchele

The number of people killed by police in 2015 was a record high. Since the start of the year, police have killed at least 317 people, according to an analysis of independent news agencies' numbers by The Guardian. This is above the total number of people killed by weapons and explosives in the U.S. that year, which was 324.

Why does this matter?

In 2015, police killed 587 people, according to the Guardian, a 15 percent increase from the year before. While this is a historically high number, it is a fraction of the number of people killed by U.S. forces in Vietnam.

Police killings are particularly concerning because the public is often unaware of them. While the public knows that police officers use deadly force, it is less aware that police officers kill people.

Elisabeth Rosenthal, director of the Justice Policy Institute, said, "When police kill people, they are immediately scrutinized by the media and the public as though they are threatening the life of the chief of police."

The Guardian's analysis of state-by-state numbers suggest that some states, like Arizona and Louisiana, have more officers killed than the national average. In fact, Louisiana, which has had the highest number of total police killings in the last two years, has one of the poorest records in terms of community relations with the police.

A recent report from the American Civil Liberties Union found that in Louisiana, police were more likely to use chokeholds to subdue people than any other type of force except guns.

According to the ACLU report, "in order to qualify as a 'chokehold,' a police officer must use violence on the suspect's

The home, which was built in 2011, was built in a "red zone" — the areas surrounding some of the world's most dangerous places — and is a haven for wildlife.

The location of the home in the Red Zone of Cairo, Egypt, has been a mystery for more than a decade, but now the home is finally revealed inside the walls, according to an ABC News report.

The home, which was built in 2011, was built in a "red zone" — the areas surrounding some of the world's most dangerous places — and is a haven for wildlife, according to an ABC News report.

"It's like a zoo," one resident told the news outlet. "There are elephants, zebras, giraffes, jaguars, all kinds of animals and birds."

The home, which was built with a "red zone" designation, was located in an area that had been declared a terrorist zone by the Egyptian government for a number of years.

However, the home is now a popular attraction for tourists and residents, according to the ABC News report.

"The house was built by a family of five and has been here for 10 years," said Mohamed Abbas, owner of Mohamed Abdel el-Qattan's home. "They knew it had to be here, and now the house is a museum. There are all kinds of animals, birds and monkeys."

Qattan said the house is a safe haven for wildlife, as he has lived there since 1996.

"We got a lot of visitors from all over the world, and they come here to see the animals," he said. "There is a lot of noise, but it's like a zoo."

AUBURN, Ala. — Auburn's top recruit, wide receiver Calvin Ridley, said Wednesday that he has not made a final decision about which school to attend.

"I have not made a final decision," Ridley said during a media availability. "I'm just going to take my time and see where my mind is at. I just want to know what's best for me and my family."

Ridley, a five-star prospect from Houston, said he is leaning toward the Tigers. He chose Auburn over Florida and Alabama last year.

"I love Auburn," Ridley said. "I love the campus, the program, the coaches, the players. I know everybody is going to be talking about it, but I'm just going to take my time and see what's best for me and my family."

Auburn has not made a final decision on its quarterback or running back.

Ridley said he will take a "little break" as he decides his college destination. But he said he would make his final decision soon.

"I'm going to wait and see what Auburn has to offer me," Ridley said. "I just want to know what's best for me and my family."

Auburn plans to hold its spring game at 9 a.m. Sunday at Jordan-Hare Stadium.

The Tigers, who are coming off a 9-4 season, are expected to open the season against South Carolina on Aug. 31. The Gamecocks, who went 9-4 last year, have won seven of the past nine in the series.

From the moment the Houston Astros signed Mark Appel, the first thing I thought was: "Wow, that's a lot of money."

I want to make it clear that I am not complaining. I don't care about the money. It's a great addition to this team.

The Astros' big signing was for right-hander Chris Devenski, who is a pitcher.

It's not like the Astros have been throwing up dingers for years. They are the only team in baseball without a home run in 2016.

Appel is a great pitcher. He will be a great pitcher. He is the type of pitcher that the Astros should sign more often. This was a great addition to this team.

But I have to wonder about how much money the Astros should spend on Appel.

He is a big-time prospect. He is a potential ace. And while he is only 22 years old, he has had a pretty rough three seasons in the big leagues — a 5.04 ERA in 30 starts, with a 5.28 FIP in 46.2 innings.

The thing is: I think it's a little early to say that Appel is the future ace of this team. But what I do know is that Appel is a big-time pitcher.

It's not like he is a six-foot-seven, 200-pound pitcher. He is a six-foot-one, 200-pound pitcher. That size has been a problem for him in the big-leagues.

Just look at some of the pitches he's thrown this year:

This is a fastball. This is a curveball. This is a slider.

He's thrown this at various points since the beginning of the 2015 season.

The fastball is probably his best pitch. It's got two inches of sinking action and a lot of movement.

The curveball is a good pitch, with a good amount of movement. It's a changeup, but a changeup that you just don't throw in the big leagues.

The slider is a good pitch, with a good amount of movement. It's a changeup, but a changeup that you don't throw in the big leagues.

Appel is a big-time pitcher. He doesn't throw a lot of fastballs. He doesn't throw a lot of curveballs. He doesn't throw a lot of sliders.

But he does throw a ton of fastball-slider combinations.

Those are the pitches that Appel is most comfortable throwing in the big leagues. He works lots of fastballs and curves in his bullpen. He sticks a lot of sliders.

He has been throwing those pitches in the big leagues. The problem is that they're not producing.

He has struggled as a starter. He has struggled as a reliever. He has struggled as a starter in the minors. He's struggled as a reliever in the minors.

Why wasn't he able to stick in the big leagues? Well, he's not a dominant pitch. He's a strikeout pitch.

Appel is a strikeout pitch. And he's not dominant. He needs to work on his command. And his command is a big issue.

He doesn't have a lot of deception. He doesn't have a lot of movement. He doesn't have a lot of deception.

Appel can command his fastball and slider. But he can't command his fastball and curveball.

I know this is almost a cliché, but Appel needs to get his curveball more down. He needs to work on his curveball.

And it's not like Appel is a perfect pitch. It's not like Appel is a perfect guy. He needs to work on his command and his command is a big issue.

Appel is a great pitcher. He's a great pitcher. The Astros should sign him a lot more often.

But I'm kind of surprised that they didn't sign him more often. He's a player who is going to be a big-time player in this league. He's the type of pitcher that the Astros should sign more often.

The head of the University of New Mexico's campus police department has resigned after a woman was arrested after she passed out in his patrol car.

The woman, who had been drinking, was arrested after she was found passed out in the back seat of the patrol car after the police department stopped her for a broken tail light.

The university president, Ray Anderson, said in a news release that the officer had "failed to meet the high standards" of the department, which he said was "a reflection of the university's desire to maintain a safe community."

The university is not investigating the incident, which happened on Sept. 17.

The university has hired a consultant to review campus police, and Anderson said the university would ask the consultant to report back by the end of the month.

Anderson said he had been a police officer for 20 years and saw the job as an honorable one.

"When I began, I thought it was a noble job, and I think it still is," Anderson said.

The officer who resigned, Scott Winnebent, had been with the police department for less than a year.

The university has hired an advisory firm to review the department, and Anderson said he hoped to have a new chief in place by the fall.

The university has also hired a consultant to review the department.

Anderson said he was disappointed in how the incident unfolded.

"I'm devastated by what happened," he said. "I hope the officer is fully accepted by the community and the people of New Mexico."<|endoftext|>The Trump administration is vowing to "rebuild the American military" — and that's good news for the military budget and the defense contractors who are already raking in the dough.

President Trump signed an executive order last week that will open the door to a major buildup of the military, with the administration touting the order as a sign that the U.S. is "back to work."

"President Trump is rebuilding our military," Defense Secretary James Mattis said in a statement. "This order provides the resources we need to rebuild the military the way it was in the 1980s. We will rebuild our military so it can meet current and future threats and opportunities, and we will make America more prosperous and secure."

Presumably, Trump's plan includes new money for the military. But the overwhelming majority of the money will go to defense contractors, who would see massive increases in federal contracts.

For instance, Lockheed Martin will receive $19.4 billion in additional contracts over the next five years, and Northrop Grumman stands to take home $18.2 billion in new contracts for bomber aircraft.

It's not just the defense contractors who stand to benefit from Trump's military-building spree. Drug companies like Pfizer, Merck, Eli Lilly, and Johnson & Johnson have also reportedly been awarded billions of dollars in new contracts.

It's already been a bonanza for defense contractors.

In 2016, U.S. defense contractors spent $342 billion on arms and military-related products, up 34 percent from $260 billion in 2013, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Defense contractors have also been raking in the dough. Lockheed Martin, for example, made $7.6 billion in profits last year, up from $6.6 billion the year before.

While the military-industrial complex has been a powerful force in U.S. politics for decades, the bulk of its funding came from taxes and fees paid by the American people.

This was especially true during the Reagan administration, when the defense budget grew by more than 50 percent under then-President Ronald Reagan.

That's why, in 1986, Congress passed the Defense Production Act, which imposed a three-pronged tax on U.S. defense contractors.

One portion of the tax was a tax on the profits that military contractors made from weapons and military-related equipment. Another tax was a tax on the employment of military and civilian employees on their weapons and equipment. The third part of the tax was a tax on the costs that the government incurs for developing and purchasing the weapons and equipment.

This is what Trump is trying to do now, by imposing a one-time tax on the $1.3 trillion in profits that defense contractors have amassed over the past decade.

In order to implement this tax, Trump will need to somehow get Congress to repeal a law that allows defense contractors to pay taxes on their overseas profits.

So far, no Republicans have agreed to repeal the law. But that's likely to change in the next two years, when GOP leaders look to have a much easier time passing tax reform.

The political pressure to repeal the Defense Production Act is likely to be intense.

"I don't think there's any doubt that repealing the production tax credit is a key priority of the Trump administration," said Eric Toder,

The Daily Mail is advertising for a new "independent media consultant" to help "bring the truth to the British people's attention."

The ad is for a "multi-award winning" analyst to "provide expert analysis of the media landscape, including the impact of online content, social media and online advertising."

The description of The Daily Mail's role says that the company's role is "to help the Conservative party and Government achieve its objectives through the delivery of effective, accurate and fair journalism."

The ad is for a two-year contract.

It is unclear if the Daily Mail paid for the ad, but it is likely to have been paid for by The Daily Mail Group, which owns the Daily Mail and The Sun.

The Daily Mail is a member of the Alliance for Audited Media, a coalition of scores of British, German, Italian and other media organizations that has been trying to get the UK government to audit the advertising of the country's newspapers.

A coalition of news organizations has been pushing for the UK government to audit the advertising of the UK's newspapers https://t.co/iYwO7bQwGM — Julie Hyland (@juliehyland) October 7, 2017


Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre has been a strong supporter of the UK government's plan to audit the advertising of the UK's newspapers, both during the unsuccessful 2015 campaign for a media reform bill and during the 2017 general election campaign. Dacre has written many defenses of the idea that the UK government should audit the advertising of the UK's newspapers.

A spokesman for The Daily Mail said the campaign for an audit had "nothing to do with the Daily Mail."

"This was a piece of work that was commissioned by another media outlet and we feel that this constitutes a breach of our editorial independence and self-regulation," the spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.

The Daily Mail is owned by News UK, the parent company of The Sun.

News UK, which also owns the Daily Telegraph, The Times, and the Sunday Times, is a member of the Alliance for Audited Media, and the press association has written to the UK government asking for a review of its media self-regulation regime.

By S.E. Smith

The historic, well-documented history of anti-father rulings is shocking, to say the least.

In addition to the many previous examples of anti-father rulings that we have documented previously, the following are the most recent newsworthy rulings:


1. Pennsylvania v. Dreeben (2006)


In 2006, a Pennsylvania mother abandoned her three sons at a Catholic-run shelter on the advice of her lawyer. The mother was accused of child abandonment, and the judge fined her $200 and ordered her to undergo parenting classes. With the father's consent, the State of Pennsylvania granted custody to the mother. The mother's attorney, however, had a different opinion. He told the court that the father was only obligated to pay child support until the children turned 18—a point that the father strongly disputed in court.

The father's attorney argued that the mother was "not a good fit" for her children, that she was "not a good mother," and that she had created a "toxic environment" in the shelter. The judge disagreed. He ordered the father to pay child support and ordered the mother to attend parenting classes.

2. Illinois v. Smith (2005)


Another Illinois mother abandoned her four children. The State's Attorney claimed that the mother was not a good parent because she had "failed to meet the minimum standard for parental responsibility and thereby caused [the children] to be placed in the state's care." The mother was ordered to attend

A constituent who made a complaint about a local councillor's appearance called a police station begging for help because he was being harassed online.

Michael Kane, 35, phoned the police after he was subjected to a vicious trolling campaign which began when he told a constituent that he was wearing a "very nice suit".

The man who he spoke to at the police station was far less complimentary about his appearance, telling him that he was "just a poor bum".

After the inappropriate comments were posted online Mr Kane reported the matter to police and the matter is now being investigated.

Mr Kane said: "I think it's a disgrace that someone could be so cruel about someone's appearance in such a way. I just couldn't believe that someone could be so vicious about it.

"I phoned the police station to make a complaint. They told me it was a matter for the police but I felt so much better after talking to them.

"I just thought it was terrible that someone in my position would have to be subjected to this kind of treatment.

"I'm still trying to process everything – it's still very upsetting to think that someone could be so cruel about someone's appearance."

Mr Kane, who lives in the north of Wales, added: "I'm actually quite embarrassed about it. I'm a bit of a sportsman and I'm a very fit person.

"But it gives me a bit of a hard time when people are cruel about my appearance. I'm a bit of an exhibitionist.

"I've been on TV shows and in magazines and I get a lot of attention for it.

"I'm a bit of a loner and I've never been in a relationship. I'm not the kind of person that has long-term relationships. I think I'm just a poor bum."

The online comments were posted on a Facebook post by Michael Kane, a Labour councillor for Newport, which included a photo of him with his three children.

The post was shared online by a local resident, who added: "Is there anything to worry about? You look a bit like a man who's just worked on a factory floor. I think you have a bit of a smile on your face."

A friend of the councillor said: "He's pretty annoyed. I think it's a disgrace that someone could be so cruel about someone's appearance in such a way."

A Conservative councillor for the same area did not want to comment on the matter.

A police spokeswoman said: "We can confirm that an incident of this nature has taken place. The matter remains under investigation and enquiries are ongoing. We take all reports of hate crime extremely seriously and are working with the local authority to identify the individual(s) involved".<|endoftext|>Whether you're in the market for a new mattress, or want to upgrade your current one, a good mattress is an investment that will likely pay off in the long run.

This issue is about so much more than whether contraception should be covered under insurance, and there's plenty of room on the spectrum for different perspectives, even on the issue of whether that coverage should be available to everyone.

However, the much more important question to ask is whether the religious right has, in fact, become so stridently opposed to contraception that it's actually pushed the religious right off the religious right's supposed positions on other topics.

A little over a year ago, on ABC's "This Week," a big religious right splinter group called the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) was honoring the late Jerry Falwell Jr., who was a champion for religious freedom. Overall, the ADF was pretty cheerful about its association with Falwell, but their ADF-sponsored event was marred by a controversial moment.

On the ADF-sponsored "Freedom Summit" in Washington D.C. on June 20, 2015, the religious right group Voices for Christian Schools was thrilled to be honored by ADF, a group which has been at the center of a battle over whether private schools should be required to include contraception in their health plans.

ADF was also thrilled to have other religious right groups, including the American Family

Are you a new parent wondering how to best approach a baby's first bath? The bath is a crucial part of the baby's first days of life, and it should be handled with care.

What to Expect

Depending on your baby's age, the first bath may last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.

If your baby is in the first month of life, the bath should be done at night.

If your baby is between 6 and 12 months old, the bath should be done at 4 a.m.

If your baby is 12 months old or older, the bath should be done as soon as he wakes up so that he's ready to get out of bed.

Dressing Your Baby

After your baby has been bathed, it's time to dress him.

If you're bathing your baby in a sink or bathtub, wait for him to settle down and then put him on your lap. If you're bathing him in a tub, put him on your shoulders, behind your neck. Avoid pressure on your baby's legs.

Sit your baby on your lap and hold him gently.

Gently massage your baby's scalp with your fingers and gently rub his back.

Take your baby's feet and hold them in your lap.

Put your baby in his diaper and help him get into it.

Carefully place your baby on the bath mat.

Wrap your baby in a corner of the bath mat until he is fully dressed.

What to Do While Your Baby Dies

If your baby is experiencing anything that might be considered a medical emergency, call 911.<|endoftext|>As a very young woman, I was always a bit of a tomboy. My friends and I would play dress-up in the school yard, and my mom would get in on the action. But I would also wear jeans and a t-shirt underneath my school uniform. I wasn't allowed to have my hair done until I was around 11, so I would just wear a ponytail and a long-sleeve shirt.

When I was older, I spent a lot of time fantasizing about boys. I would pull on my dad's jeans and motorcycle jacket and pretend I was riding around on a motorcycle with a hottie like myself. I would imagine what it would be like to be a man and act like a man. I would imagine what it would be like to be in a man's body and act like a man. I wanted to be a man, and I wanted to be a man in the way I wanted to be.

But I wasn't exactly sure what that meant.

I don't think I ever really thought about what it meant to be a man. For most of my life, I felt like I was just a woman trapped in a man's body. My body felt like a woman's body, and I would just wear jeans and a t-shirt underneath my school uniform. But I didn't know if I was a woman trapped in a man's body or a man trapped in a woman's body.

I started to learn more about sex when I was in college. I went to a sex-positive college where we talked about it a lot — and about sex in general. It was a huge part of my life. I started looking at porn and went off to college knowing that my body was female and my sexual identity was female, so that was really exciting. I actually felt like I could be a sex-positive feminist.

But I didn't feel that way, and I didn't feel like I was a feminist. I was just an ignorant young girl who liked to watch porn and have sex.

I didn't feel like I was a feminist. But I wasn't exactly sure what that meant.

Despite feeling like I was a feminist, I wasn't exactly sure what it meant to be a feminist. I had read about feminism for my college classes, but I had never really gotten to understand it. I didn't know what the word meant, because I didn't know what it meant.

But I was living in New York City when I had my first encounter with a transgender person. When I first met Rachel, I was struck by how trans* she looked. I had never really considered her trans* in my mind until that moment. I was completely struck by how she looked in a way I had never considered before. It was as if she was made up of different parts of my body, and she was a complete individual.

It was when I first met Rachel that I learned what it meant to be a trans* person. I learned about hormones, surgeries, and coming out. I learned about surgeries, hormones, and coming out. I learned about different definitions of gender.

I learned about different definitions of gender.

I learned about what it meant to be a trans* person.

Richards, who was the No. 1 pick in the 2013 NBA draft, was suspended for the first six games of the season for a failed drug test.

Richards, who signed with the Magic on Jan. 10, was suspended on July 27 after failing a drug test at the NBA combine. According to a statement given by the Magic on July 28, "Richards tested positive for a prohibited substance in his system… He has been suspended for the first six games of the season and is ineligible to play in any games for the Magic."

Richards was tested in Chicago on July 27.

The Magic selected Richards with the No. 1 pick in the 2013 NBA draft. On Jan. 10, he was acquired from the Cleveland Cavaliers in a trade that sent Andrew Bynum to the Cavaliers and Andrew Nicholson to Orlando, along with the No. 16 pick in the draft.

The Magic are 4-8 this season, and they're counting on Richards to help them become more competitive in the Eastern Conference. Orlando is tied for the second-worst record in the Eastern Conference — five games back of the Washington Wizards.

Richards is expected to serve his suspension during the Magic's three-game road trip to the East Coast from Tuesday through Sunday.

Richards' suspension will keep him out of Orlando's first three games.<|endoftext|>The Pirate Bay is shipping some new software to users, which is the biggest change in the site's 3-year history.

And as we have seen, the problem with this is that it is easy to overlook the poor analysis of how much a player's defensive contributions mean for their team. I have argued that the difference between which teams were better and worse defensively last year was not really the difference in the quality of their defensive contributions, but rather, it was the difference in their respective teams' defensive contributions. For teams like the Raptors, the Raptors' team defense was fairly similar to the Bucks' team defense, because the Raptors had a league-average defensive rating while the Bucks' team defense was slightly below average. This means that the difference between the Raptors' team defense and the Bucks' team defense really was just the difference in their defensive contributions.

The Celtics were clearly worse than the Bucks. But they were right up there with the Raptors. The difference between the Celtics' team defense and the Raptors' team defense was the difference in the Bucks' team defense. The difference between the Celtics' team defense and the Bucks' team defense was due to the Bucks being much worse defensively than the Celtics.

So, what about the Raptors?

The Raptors were no better defensively than Milwaukee. They were not worse defensively than Boston. They were noticeably worse defensively than the Kings. They were worse defensively than the Pelicans. They were worse defensively than the Timberwolves. They were worse defensively than the Wolves. They were worse defensively than the Bucks.

The Raptors' defensive contributions were down in all categories except the best one: 10th best in defensive rating. So why were they so bad defensively?

Well, it's complicated. I believe that the key is that Toronto's defensive contributions were dominated by their defense in the final quarter. After that, the Raptors' defensive contributions were not very good at all. They were just average.

That's a little odd, because the Raptors played in the second half of the season. They got better, but their defensive contributions weren't that great.

Does the difference in the Raptors' offense and defense indicate that the Raptors were better defensively than the Bucks? Not really. The difference in Bucks' offense and defense is due to their defense. The difference in Raptors' offense and defense is due to their offense.

In conclusion, I believe that the difference in Toronto's offense and defense is due to where they played. If we look at the top 10 teams in offensive and defensive rating, the Raptors are right up there, but they are not there in the top 10.

The bottom 10 teams in offensive and defensive rating are where the Raptors should be. The Raptors, even when they were really bad defensively, were still better than most of the bottom 10.<|endoftext|>The new model is the same as the one that was released in June, which had a single-channel design (pitch control, volume control), a USB port, and three-band EQ.

O'Malley's campaign is under fire for a campaign ad that implies that the nation's largest police union is somehow responsible for violent crime.

The ad, which first aired in San Francisco this week, shows a man dressed in black with a scarf covering his face sitting in a police car.

"I'm not afraid of the police," the man says, then explains to the camera that he was attacked by officers and his insurance company has dropped his coverage.

The ad then shows a photo of a man in a suit and a tie, whose face is covered by a hoodie and sunglasses.

"He's a cop, I'm not," the man says, adding that his insurance company refused to pay his medical bills.

The narrator says, "There's no question that the hardworking men and women of the San Francisco Police Department are doing their jobs. … But in the last several years, these hardworking men and women have been targeted by the very people asking them to protect them. The San Francisco Police Officers Association is the most powerful police union in California."

But the San Francisco Police Officers Association, a union of more than 200 members, says the ad is misleading.

"At no time have the officers spoken or considered themselves to be under attack by law enforcement," said Lt. John Sawyer in a statement. "The officers of the SFPD are proud of their work in San Francisco."

The union says the man in the video is not an SFPD officer and that the man who was featured in the ad is not a member of the SFPD.

The video was shot in August 2013. The ad was first aired in the San Francisco neighborhood of the same name in November.

The two-minute video has been viewed more than 3,000 times since it first aired.

O'Malley's campaign was quick to respond to the ad.

"Just as the Governor recognizes the link between crime and income inequality, he also thinks that the income inequality that exists in this country is a direct result of the income inequality that exists in this country," said spokesman Brian Coy. "Gov. O'Malley understands that the issues of racial and economic justice are directly related and that both of these issues are connected to the un-bridled militarization of local police forces that has plagued this country for decades."

O'Malley has been under pressure from activists and politicians in recent weeks after the release of a string of police-involved shootings of unarmed black men.

The officer who shot and killed Freddie Gray in Baltimore was found not guilty of murder in his death in April. In Ferguson, Mo., a white police officer fatally shot a black teenager, Michael Brown, after a brief struggle.

In San Francisco, O'Malley has been under fire for a series of statements that have drawn criticism for their potential to incite racial tensions.

Last month, O'Malley defended the city's plan to police the city's homeless, which critics have said disproportionately affects people of color.

"This is a problem that is multi-factorial," O'Malley said. "It's not just the issues of the homeless; it's the issues of poverty, like lack of affordable housing, not having enough food, lack of healthcare, and a lack of good schools."

O'Malley, who is black, has said he was "deeply troubled" by Gray's death and that his family is "in mourning."

The Associated Press contributed to this report.<|endoftext|>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced a bill that would allow companies to keep their genomes from being used for marketing purposes, even if the data is sold to outside parties.

Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and 46 other Democrats submitted a bill to Congress on Tuesday that would require companies that offer, sell or otherwise use genetic data to provide an opportunity for patients to request their data be kept private.

Lieu said biotechnology companies sell genetic data and medical records to pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies and others without patients being notified.

"This legislation would force the companies to tell you, the patient, whether or not they're selling your genome to another company," Lieu said on a press call.

The bill has been referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

In addition to Lieu and the Democrats' bill, the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California also submitted its own legislation late last year that would require companies to notify patients before they release genetic data to third parties.

The ACLU's legislation is part of a broader push to ensure that consumers have a way to control their own personal data and ensure that their genetic information is protected.

"We have to change the paradigm that the genetic information is so untouchable and so valuable that we can't use it for marketing or for any other reason, but the notion that it's so valuable that we can't share it with others, I think is a little biased

The camera was intended to be used in a variety of ways, including both simple and complex aerial photography, as well as remote monitoring. The project started off as an attempt to keep costs down, but after months of work, I was able to make the camera more affordable to a much wider audience.

The camera is designed to be simple enough that a user can pick it up and start using it immediately. It operates on a single AA battery (for in-flight operation), and the power consumption of the camera is nearly negligible, around 0.2 mW. The camera can be easily removed from the base and cleaned. The camera is designed to be very small and could easily fit on a keychain, and I've even added an optional US$25 charger that attaches to the camera base.

The camera does not have a built-in GPS receiver, but it's designed to use any inexpensive GPS receiver that is available on the market.

The camera is powered by an On/Off switch on the camera and a single AA battery. The camera has an LED on the base that indicates the battery level.

The camera is designed to be used with a variety of wireless gps receivers. The most popular gps receivers are the Turnigy G2R, Turnigy G3 and Turnigy G3S.

The camera works by scanning for a GPS signal from a gps receiver and then sending the GPS coordinates to the gps receiver. The gps receiver receives the coordinates and sends them to the frame rate-limited, open source gpsd kernel.

The camera is based on the free and open-source gpsd-kernel, which is available on Github. There are various problems with the gpsd-kernel that needed to be addressed in order to make the project more accessible to a wider audience.

The main problems with gpsd-kernel that were addressed are:

Bandwidth: Having a gpsd kernel that is limited to a 5GHz band causes it to be unusable for most mobile devices. It also causes problems for the gpsd-kernel when connecting to a hardware GPS receiver that is not on the same band.

Low-power consumption: gpsd-kernel is designed to run on a single battery, but in order to use it in a wide variety of ways, it needs to run in the background on the battery's power.

Open source: gpsd-kernel is developed and maintained by several volunteers. It is available under a free and open-source license.

Camera: Before I started working on the project, I had considered a simple, cheap, open source, handheld camera. However, as I began to work on the project, I realized that the camera would need to be much more sophisticated than that. The camera has to be both simple and inexpensive, so that a user can pick it up and start using it immediately. A simple, cheap, open source camera would have some major problems, including an extremely poor resolution, low frame rate, and poor quality image. The camera also needs to be strong enough that it can withstand heavy use, including a strong wind.

In the end, I chose to use the gpsd-kernel, which has a good set of features and is relatively simple to implement. The gpsd-kernel can send and receive GPS coordinates, and uses UDP to communicate with the gpsd kernel.

The gpsd-kernel is built on top of the free and open-source gpsd-kernel, which is available on Github. There are various problems with the gpsd-kernel that needed to be addressed in order to make the project more accessible to a wider audience.

The gpsd-kernel has a few problems, most notably that it does not have any support for the RTL-SDR, and it does not support RTTY. The gpsd-kernel currently supports the following RTL-SDR modes

"You have to be careful with this stuff," he said. "If you do, you're going to get into trouble."

A few months later, Mr. Trump's aides began to fill the deputy director's office with former campaign advisers.

"I wasn't happy, and I didn't want to be around," Mr. Rogers said. But he left, and Mr. Trump was appointed national security adviser, and he filled other posts with former campaign aides. Mr. Rogers remained on the job.

Mr. Rogers said his superiors were "unhappy about the fact that I was leaving." They "wanted to keep me, but they wanted me to do this or that."

The first Trump campaign adviser who sought a security clearance was Carter Page, who had been advising the Trump campaign on energy and international trade, and who was a frequent guest on Mr. Trump's favorite radio show, "The Howard Stern Show."

Mr. Page was trying to develop a project in Kazakhstan, which he believed would be a new source of energy. His business partner was a Russian aluminum magnate, Oleg Deripaska, who had been accused by Western governments of being a front for the Kremlin.

The two men were traveling in the early months of the campaign, and Mr. Page was taking notes. "I was having a really good time in the campaign," Mr. Page said in an interview last week. "I had a lot of fun. I was enjoying it."

But Mr. Page's work in Kazakhstan was coming under scrutiny from American intelligence officials, who suspected that Mr. Deripaska, his business partner, was involved in corruption and was funneling money from the United States to the Russian government.

Mr. Page said he did not know about the suspicions against his business partner.

"I never met with Oleg Deripaska," Mr. Page said. He said he had nothing to do with the aluminum business. "I'm not an aluminum magnate," he said. "I don't know what he does."

Mr. Page said he had never heard of the "Bolton dossier" until the Times asked him about it.

"The dossier was certainly circulated all over Washington," Mr. Page said. "I was not aware of any of it at the time."

Mr. Page said he was "unaware" that he had been named as a former Soviet spy. "I have no idea whether I was, were or am a spy," he said.

In March, Mr. Page was interviewed at the FBI's offices in New York by the F.B.I.'s counterintelligence agents. The agents said they needed to know more about a meeting that Mr. Page had with a Russian diplomat, Sergey Kislyak, during the summer of 2016.

Mr. Page said he had not met the diplomat, whom he did not identify, and dismissed his presence at the Trump campaign event in July as a casual encounter.

"I'm not really sure what the big deal is," Mr. Page said in an interview.

The F.B.I. agents asked him about his interactions with the Russian diplomat at the Republican National Convention and at a speech he made at a Moscow university.

Mr. Page said he did not remember discussing the Trump campaign with Mr. Kislyak and had not spoken with him since the convention.

"I think they were trying to get more information about Russia's election plans, and I gave them what I thought was a fairly detailed answer," he said.

Still, the F.B.I. agents were interested. After his interview, Mr. Page said, he was asked to fill out a questionnaire that would include his interactions with the Russian diplomat and the Trump campaign. He agreed to do so, he said, because he was told that the information would be kept confidential.

"My understanding is that this information was not to be shared with the Trump campaign and that if I did I would be violating federal law," Mr. Page said.

The F.B.I. did not respond to requests for comment.

On April 11, 2016, the day of the Democratic National Convention, Mr. Page flew to Moscow from New York. He had been invited to speak at an academic conference sponsored by the Moscow-based New Economic School, a private network of research universities that has been accused by American intelligence officials of having ties to the Russian government.

Sporting Kansas City's fall from grace has been a long time coming. Like most other MLS clubs, the Claret-and-Cobalt went through a rough patch at the beginning of the 2015 season.

The team's defense was porous, its attacking attack was inefficient and its two-goal lead over the Vancouver Whitecaps dwindled to one goal in the second half of the season.

Sporting Kansas City's fallen from grace has been a long time coming. Like most other MLS clubs, the Claret-and-Cobalt went through a rough patch at the beginning of the 2015 season.

The team's defense was porous, its attacking attack was inefficient and its two-goal lead over the Vancouver Whitecaps dwindled to one goal in the second half of the season.

The final straw was Sporting Kansas City's loss to the Houston Dynamo on Oct. 20. A 1-0 loss at BBVA Compass Stadium, where the team had been unbeaten since early March, was the final straw for the club as it fell out of the top three in the Western Conference standings.

Sporting Kansas City's fall from grace has been a long time coming. Like most other MLS clubs, the Claret-and-Cobalt went through a rough patch at the beginning of the 2015 season.

The team's defense was porous, its attacking attack was inefficient and its two-goal lead over the Vancouver Whitecaps dwindled to one goal in the second half of the season.

The last game of the season — a 2-1 loss to the LA Galaxy on Oct. 27 — was a microcosm of the season as a whole. A dominant performance by the Galaxy in the first half gave way to a sloppy, error-riddled performance with a number of defensive lapses in the second half.

"What we have to be better at is getting it right in the final third of the field," said Sporting Kansas City head coach Peter Vermes after the loss to LA. "We have to improve in that area of the field. It's a large improvement in the final third."

The club's current struggles in central defense are a direct result of the team's inability to defend set pieces.

Sporting Kansas City allowed 16 goals from set pieces in 2015, which was the second-most in MLS. The club's previous high for set piece goals allowed in a season was 13 allowed in 2013.

The problem for Sporting Kansas City is that it is one of the most complete teams in the league with its defense. The club has a few weak links on the back line, but there is a great deal more quality than the technical prowess of its defenders.

"The pieces we have don't match what we have on our team," Vermes said. "I think that's what we're trying to get better at."

The club's problems from set pieces are a direct result of the team's inability to defend set pieces.

The club has a few weak links on the back line, but there is a great deal more quality than the technical prowess of its defenders.

The club was the most improved team in MLS at generating set pieces in 2015. The biggest reason for that improvement was the addition of Graham Zusi. Since the club acquired the veteran midfielder, the club has tied for second in the league in set piece goals allowed in 2015 with eight.

Zusi's ability to generate set pieces has been one of the keys to Sporting Kansas City's success.

The team has a lot of depth on the back line, but it would be wise not to rely on the club's back line to generate set pieces.

The club's current struggles from set pieces are a direct result of the team's inability to defend set pieces.

The club's current woes aren't going to go away anytime soon, and it is no secret that the club is looking to beef up its defense in the offseason.

The club has some key players who have shown they are capable of covering for each other, but the team lacks an elite defender to help cover for the shortcomings of the team's back line.

Sporting Kansas City has one of the most talented, technically-gifted and versatile defenders in the league in Matt Besler. However, Besler has also shown that he has some weaknesses.

Besler has the talent to be an elite player in the league. In 2014, the Sporting KC defender led the league in minutes per game with 1,475. His work rate and work rate of 90.7 percent were the best of any defender in MLS in 2014.

The only problem is that Besler has shown that he struggles at times defending set pieces.

During the last two games of the regular season, Besler was guilty of allowing the ball to end up at his feet too often.

But there are some who are more than willing to pay that price.

Ages ago, this area of western-central Alberta began to boom with the mining and oil and gas industries, but the boom is over.

The number of workers in the region has begun to dwindle while the number of employers has increased, leaving those who do exist in a tough economic situation.

Many employers are asking their employees to work in hotels or service businesses and say it's the way they can prevent labour shortages.

CBC's Margaret Evans-Brown spoke with two companies in the area that are offering seven-day work weeks.

'You can't live on seven days'

On the other side of town, Cindy Juric was laying steel in a warehouse on a recent Saturday.

"It's a lot of work, you can't live on seven days," she says during an interview at the facility.

The 44-year-old Juric has worked for more than a decade. She's working for Kessel Steel in Fort McMurray, the only company in the area that still relies on full-time employees.

"We have a lot of people that are still working, but we're down to about two-thirds of our workforce," says Juric. "Just not enough people. It's a very difficult time."

Kessel Steel has been looking to hire full-time employees for the past year. The company has a waiting list of more than 50 people, and they're keeping their doors open to anyone who wants to work.

'It's sad, but it's reality'

Kessel Steel may be the only company in the area that still relies on full-time employees. The company is seeking full-time employees for the long term. (CBC)

Juric says as far as she's concerned, the extra money she makes is just time off and a better work life balance.

"It's very difficult for the local economy, so that's why we have to be open to the possibility of having some people work," she says.

"I don't know that we're going to be able to keep everyone."

It's a far cry from the boom years.

The former mill town of Fort McMurray has become a major tourist destination and has seen a surge in oil production, but many of the jobs have shifted to other parts of the province.

That's also one of the reasons Juric says the promise of a seven-day work week isn't necessarily appealing.

"It's sad, but it's reality," she says. "There's not enough people here to support the people that would like to work."

The company is offering a full-time job, but it's called a part-time position.

Juric says if the company's future is dependent on part-time employees, it's not a good situation.

'We're dying out'

Priscilla Hinton is one of the few remaining employees in Fort McMurray. She's the president of the Fort McMurray Workers' Association. The workers union has been trying to negotiate a shorter work week, but so far have been unsuccessful.

"We're dying out," she says. "We're trying to use our economic advantage. We're going to have to work harder and harder and harder."

She says the local economy is struggling to keep up with the huge population growth and the increase in oil and gas jobs.

"Right now, we're basically in a recession," she says. "We're the only thing that's keeping it going."

"If this wasn't for the oil and gas industry, we wouldn't be here."

Hinton says the union is hoping a seven-day work week will be introduced into the province's labour code.

It's a move that has been suggested in some other parts of the world, but it still needs to be worked out in the province.<|endoftext|>I've been a fan of the original "Guardians of the Galaxy" for quite some time now, and "Guardians of the Galaxy" Vol. 2 is by far my favorite film in the franchise. The music is amazing, the story is awesome, the action is great, and the story is so nicely paced and triggered my imagination in all the right ways. Vol. 2 also introduces the character of Star Lord (Chris Pratt), a character that is great, and in my limited experience with Pratt, he's been great. That being said, I don't think I'd want to see him in the same movie as Adam Warlock (Michael Rooker), who is basically perfect in every way.

As much as I enjoy the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, I do have a few minor gripes. The biggest one is the lack of sound effects. The music is great, and the

As a team of journalists, we have been on the ground in Gaza for over a year now and have been able to witness the daily and ongoing human tragedy of Gaza's population.

Since the start of the hostilities in July this year, over 2,100 Palestinians have been killed and over 11,000 injured, and over 80% of those killed have been civilians.

The inhumanity of the bombings of Gaza City, the latest on Wednesday, has caused widespread public outrage and deep concern among both Israelis and Palestinians.

We have seen the images of dead and injured children and other civilians, whose deaths are not the first or last to be caused by this indiscriminate Israeli assault.

We have also seen the images of the destruction caused by the Israeli military, which includes the destruction of homes, hospitals, schools, water pipes and electricity plants.

In the midst of this devastation, we have also witnessed the efforts of the international community, and humanitarian agencies, to provide aid and help to the people of Gaza.

On Thursday, 22 July, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Robert Piper, visited Gaza to assess the situation.

After his visit and after discussions with Palestinian officials and community leaders, Piper made the following statement: "I have visited Gaza several times over the last six months. The situation in Gaza is indeed heartbreaking. I hope that the international community will continue to work with the Palestinian authorities to facilitate and facilitate humanitarian aid to the civilian population in Gaza. The international community must continue to support the Palestinian people and to uphold its commitment to the principles of humanitarian law. The Palestinian people are suffering and need the support of the international community. I hope the international community will continue to show solidarity with the Palestinian people and will stand with them in their fight against the illegal Israeli blockade of Gaza."

On Monday, 22 July, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution in the Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review (UPR) on the situation in Gaza, which condemned the Israeli military actions and called on the parties to respect the human rights of civilians and civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of all civilians.

The text of the UN resolution was passed by consensus, with seven countries voting in favour, as well as several countries abstaining.

We have also seen the efforts of the UN and other international organisations to provide humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has provided food and other essential items for over two million Gazans.

UNRWA has also provided education and healthcare to over 190,000 Gazans. In December 2014, UNRWA established a $500,000 fund to support the work of the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) to provide emergency assistance to the people of Gaza.

On 21 July, UNRWA launched a new, dedicated website to provide information on education in the Gaza Strip and to update the public on the needs of UNRWA's staff.

In March this year, the UN Security Council passed a resolution by consensus to support the Palestinian people in their struggle against the Israeli blockade of Gaza. The resolution demanded that the Israeli authorities: fulfil their obligations under international humanitarian law; allow the entry of humanitarian assistance into Gaza; and allow the effective use of the ceasefire, and ensure the safety and security of all civilians.

On 22 July, the UN Security Council adopted, by consensus, Resolution 1, which called on the Israeli authorities to allow the entry of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and to ensure the safety and security of all civilians.

The resolution was adopted in a vote of 15 in favour, 7 against, and 9 abstentions.

The Security Council had been expected to adopt a similar resolution in April, but the resolution was postponed to 22 July.

The Security Council will meet again on 26 July to consider the resolution, and on 29 July, the Council will meet again to adopt a final resolution on the situation in Gaza.

This resolution, the result of intense negotiations between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, is a clear message to Israel that it has to stop the attacks on Gaza and to stop its blockade of Gaza. The resolution is also an important step towards the resumption of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

The fact that the Israeli government has not yet accepted the Palestinian position on the blockade and the security concerns raised by the UN is no excuse for the Israeli government to continue with its attacks on Gaza.

In addition to condemning the Israeli attacks, the text of the UN resolution calls on the international community to "monitor the implementation of measures taken by the parties to end the hostilities immediately and to facilitate the free flow of essential assistance to the civilian population affected by the hostilities".

It also calls on the parties to "take all necessary measures to protect civilians from the effects of hostilities, and to respect the inviolability of civilian property, including through the provision of humanitarian

France has confirmed it fired a missile from a warship towards Syria, in a response to a suspected chemical attack.

The missile was launched from the French warship, the Charles de Gaulle, after it detected what it said was a Syrian missile launch.

A French official said the missile had flown a "safe distance" before hitting its target in Syria.

The attack, which was the first time France had used military force in Syria, was condemned in the UK and in Russia.

The Syrian foreign ministry said the French missile had hit an air base in the province of Homs, and the French defence ministry later confirmed the missile had been launched from the Charles de Gaulle.

French President Francois Hollande said earlier he would ask parliament to authorise military action against Syria, saying the country had crossed "a red line".

The president said the aim was to "stop the movement of arms and ammunition to the extremists and terrorists in Syria" and to "prevent massacres".

Analysis: John Sudworth, BBC defence correspondent

The French action against Syria is a direct response to a suspected chemical weapon attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people on 4 April.

It is a clear signal that the US may now do what France did a year ago - launch military strikes against the Assad regime, which it has now confirmed was responsible for the attack.

After a year of conflict in Syria, the US and France are not alone in their determination to strike.

We've just gotten some new information on what we can expect from Microsoft's next-gen console, codenamed Project Scorpio.

The system is expected to be out in the first half of 2018 and will come with 4K resolution (2,560 x 1,440) and more powerful graphics.

The document comes from Digital Foundry, whose source then goes on to reveal some interesting details about the system's specs. For starters, the Xbox One S (which is currently on sale) will be replaced by the Scorpio system, which won't get a price cut, but will get a more powerful CPU and a beefier GPU.

According to the information, the Scorpio will sport eight CPU cores, 16 GPU cores, and a 4K resolution, with higher frame rates when it comes to VR. Along with the aforementioned specs, the system will support HDR 10 and though it isn't clear whether it will support 4K resolution, it will be more than capable of showing off the benefits of the technology.

Now, we don't quite believe that the Scorpio is a PlayStation 4. On the one hand, the Scorpio is coming from a console that is powered by a custom AMD chip, which works with the console's APU (Asynchronous Processor Unit) to process and display graphics. On the other hand, the Xbox One S is powered by an Intel processor (the A10-7800K) which supports a dual-channel DDR4 memory interface with a maximum of 8GB of RAM.

That said, if the Scorpio does come with a similar spec as the Xbox One S, it could be a very good system for gamers, especially if it also comes with some sort of VR support.

For those who are interested in the system, the next-gen console will be available for $399, though there will be a $100 premium for a 1TB console, but we're not sure if that's all that significant.

Election results showed Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party had won 63 of the 120 seats in parliament, pushing it to a comfortable majority in the Knesset, or parliament. He will be sworn in Tuesday.

"The people of Israel have chosen a new government that will change the status quo," Netanyahu said in a triumphal victory speech. "The choice they made is one of hope, of peace, and it is one that I have decided to commit myself to."

He thanked the millions of Israelis who voted, saying they "have shown that they choose peace and security, and I will work to develop these values in the state of Israel."

With the Yesh Atid party and a handful of other parties all claiming to have won seats, Abbas' Fatah movement was poised to claim a major victory, and Palestinians also said they would be voting in one of the most important elections in the history of the young nation.

The results were considered in doubt were it not for a surprise agreement between Hamas and Gaza's rulers to agree to a ceasefire, which came into effect shortly before polls closed Sunday. Hamas hailed the agreement as a victory for the people of Gaza and for the Palestinian cause.

The agreement, brokered by Egypt, called for a 72-hour ceasefire from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Monday. The Israelis were hoping to use the ceasefire to hit Hamas military targets, as well as the smuggling tunnels that have proliferated in recent months between Gaza and Israel.

The Israeli military said that at least 30 rockets fired at Israel from Gaza were intercepted by its Iron Dome defense system, as well as a rocket fired from Gaza at a kibbutz in Israel. Two rockets were intercepted over the country, and there were no casualties.

Palestinian negotiators said the Gaza ceasefire would last eight hours, with both sides to have access to the other side's territory. The sides have yet to sign the agreement, but Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal said his group had "absolutely no problem" with the deal.

It was the first time Israel and Hamas had agreed to a truce in the conflict since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.

Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal said his group had "absolutely no problem" with the ceasefire.

Palestinian factions have until Tuesday to decide whether to honor the truce.

Hamas had said it would abide by the agreement and vote.

Living and working in a city, as I do, often is like coming home for a week-long holiday. I always hope that the city will remain as vibrant and interesting as it was during the week I was away. But that's often not the case.

"You can't always stay on the same level of activity," said an acquaintance who lives in a city. He spoke on the condition that I not use his name.

"Some of the best things in a city are its people, but some of the worst things in a city are its people. So you know what I'm talking about," he said.

A couple of years ago when I was working in a city, the conversation always turned to the idea of what's happening with the city the next day. If the city is busy, then the next day it will be still busy. If the city is quiet, then the next day it will be quiet.

Might I suggest a more positive way to think about the city? What's happening in the city today? What's happening to you, and what's happening to the people around you? A city, it turns out, is an ecosystem: a complex web of people, activities, and ideas.

This is why cities are so powerful. They are not just places, as we were taught. They are a number of things at once. It's a way of thinking about cities that has been gaining favor in recent years.

In his book, The Geography of Cities, the economist Samuel Bowles discusses the idea that cities are as much "ecosystems as they are places." This is the idea that cities are made up of people interacting with their environment. This is what Bowles means by "ecosystems."

Bowles points out that ecosystems do not just exist within the confines of a place; they exist across a broad range of scales, from the species and genus level to the species level and even across species and genera.

Bowles also argues that ecosystems serve as memory sites for a species, allowing them to remember their geographic location and changing environments.

The same idea can be applied to cities. Municipalities are made up of people interacting with each other, and there are a number of things that happen within them. A city is made up of people living in it, and there are plenty of things that happen within a city that are not limited to how it is structured.

So, what will happen to the city when you leave? What will happen when you move out? Will you be able to keep up with everything going on? Will it be a new experience?

Well, I'll give a couple of suggestions to help you out.

First, remember the city you're leaving. In the first week of your absence from the city, it may feel like the city is changing. You may find yourself awestruck by the towering skyscrapers that line the streets. You may find yourself wondering if you've left the city.

Second, keep up with what's happening. If you're not keeping up, you do not belong. It's time to start.

Third, keep your eyes open. Look out for people you might have missed. Go to social events, concerts, and other events in the city you're leaving. Look for people in their favorite activities.

Fourth, extend a hand when they want to talk. They may have never met you before, but the city is their home. It's where they raise their kids, where they live, where they go to school, where they go to work, where they raise their pets.

Fifth, try to be positive. The city is full of surprises, and it's full of people who are doing things that are new or seem wonderful. If you make the effort to find out more, you may discover that the people you thought you knew are not the people you thought you knew.

Finally, remember the city you're coming back to. Although it may seem like a new city, the city you're returning to has the same things that make it great. It's a place where you can find a job and a home, where you can go to school and learn, where the kids have a place to play, where you can find a community to help you get through your transition.

You may not like everything about the city you're returning to, but it's a place that will always be with you, and its best days are yet to come.

You use your phone to call an Uber home and the car comes; you sit in the back seat and the order is made. Your Uber ride is over and you're back home.

This is the future of Uber's controversial ride-hailing service, and it's coming soon to a city near you.

A new partnership between the ride-hailing company and Microsoft is bringing the ride-hailing service to the Xbox One. The service, called UberX, will be available in the United States starting July 5, according to the Seattle Times.

Uber has been testing the Xbox One's Kinect camera for several months now, and it's bringing the feature to the ride-hailing service as part of a wider push to make its service available on as many platforms as possible.

The company does most of its business on mobile devices, and it's eager to bring its service to as many platforms as possible. The Xbox One is expected to be a significant growth driver for Uber's business, as many people upgrade to new and cheaper phones every year.

Uber has been a part of Microsoft's mobile efforts for years, and it's signed up more than 100,000 developers to build apps for the platform. The company is also working on integrating Cortana voice commands, which can be used to book rides and request the company's Uber cars.

The Xbox One partnership is just the latest in a series of deals involving Microsoft's mobile efforts. The company is also working on a number of other services, including a Windows 10 mobile operating system, and it's developing several new apps for Windows 10.

Both Uber and Microsoft are playing a role in rolling out the new ride-hailing service, but they're not the only ones. The company is also partnering with Leap Transit, a Seattle-based company that operates a fleet of electric shuttles.

This is not the first time Microsoft has worked with Uber — the company teamed up with Uber to get the service to the Xbox One.

The Xbox One and the Xbox 360 have been gaining ground in recent years, and the company is making big bets on the future of gaming. With Microsoft's new Xbox One console and a new Microsoft HoloLens augmented reality headset, the company is taking on Apple and Google in the gaming industry.<|endoftext|>Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF

It's a common technique seen in many games, but it has a slight problem. If you have multiple characters that create clones of themselves, you end up with a lot of clones.

In this video (see the above video for the full GIF), Kieren Stoneman uses a technique called "mutation multipliers" to give his clones a drastically increased defense. It's pretty much the opposite of what you'd expect, but there is a reason why this is a very common technique.

This technique was first discovered by a guy named Scott Mester, and I personally first saw it in a game called Infestation: Survivor Stories.

That game used a technique called "mutation multipliers" to give its characters increased defense. It's a common technique seen in many games, but it has a slight problem. If you have multiple characters that create clones of themselves, you end up with a lot of clones.

In this GIF, you can see how the clones of the protagonist transform into a whole mess of dicks.

Mutation multipliers is a technique that allows you to give clones of a character a much much higher defense. It's a very quick and effective way to avoid having a lot of clones, but it does have one problem:

If you have multiple characters that create clones of themselves, you end up with a lot of clones.

Here's an example of how I would use this technique.

Here's a video that shows how it works:

Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF

In this video, we have two clones of myself (the red circles). They each have a 100 defense, and we don't want them to be doubled.

I have a clone of myself (the green circles) that has a defense of 100. I also have a clone of myself (the blue circles) that has a defense of 110.

Now, we want to increase the defense of the clones of myself so that they are all 120. The technique I'm using is mutation multipliers.

The technique was discovered by Scott Mester, and it's very easy to use. In the video, he uses it to double the defense of his clones.

The results are rather incredible:

See how the clones have doubled their defense? It's pretty amazing.

This technique is also used in one of the most popular games in the world, Overwatch.

I had a lot of fun working on this post, and really enjoyed the process of putting it together. It was very, very fun to see the eyes light up when I brought up my favorite topic, fan theories. I've got plenty of my own theories, but I thought it would be interesting to see what others thought.

This post is not sponsored, and all opinions are my own.

What is a fan theory?

Fan theories are beliefs and ideas that are put forth as a possible explanation for something that has not been proven anywhere. Theories are usually based on what we know about the universe, or what we think is true. They are usually very specific, and limited in scope.

Examples of fan theories include:

The Loch Ness Monster is real.

The Easter Bunny is real.

The real moon landing actually happened.

The government is hiding something.

The aliens are invading earth.

The President is a robot.

The time machine is real.

The government is hiding something.

Santa is real.

The Toy Story movies are really just a metaphor for a revolution.

One of the main reasons that fan theories are so popular is because it gives a sense of 'belief' in the material we are given. There is a sense of excitement in the idea that something we love and believe in might not be true. It's like being in a tightly controlled laboratory, and you finally get to test out your theories.

Of course, as with any theory, there are many things that can be wrong with a fan theory, and it's easy to make a huge mistake.

However, fan theories are usually pretty accurate with regard to the material that is given, so I thought it might be fun to discuss a few of the more popular ones, as well as some of my own theories.

What are some of the most popular fan theories?

There are a number of theories that have been around for a while. Some of them are old, like the Loch Ness Monster, and some of them are even older than that. So what are some of the most popular ones? Let's take a look.

The Theory That Aliens Are Coming To Earth

This is a popular theory, and it has been around a long time. Many people believe that aliens are coming to earth, and that they were here all along. The first place many people think of when discussing this theory is the 'Seen it on YouTube' videos.

Theories of this type are pretty popular, and they are often very specific. One of the most common theories is that aliens are trying to invade earth. They don't necessarily want to mess with us, but they do want to get our technology, and possibly crash land on our planet. The worst thing that can happen to us would be if they just drop on our planet, and kill us all.

Theories of this type include:

The aliens are trying to invade earth.

The aliens are trying to invade earth, but they aren't successful.

The aliens are planning to invade earth, but find that it is a lot harder than they thought.

The aliens are trying to invade earth, but they are too successful.

The aliens are trying to invade earth, but they are defeated.

The aliens are trying to invade earth, but they are defeated, and the aliens are taken back to their home planet.

The first time I watched this film, I was a kid. I was only about 8 or 9 years old, and I really was too young to understand the historical significance of the film. I still remember it vividly, but I don't think I really understood what it was really about at the time. This past weekend, I watched the film again, and it didn't take me very long to recognize that this film is incredibly important, and one of the most important films of all time.

Now, I don't know what my opinion is on this film, so perhaps I should start by saying that I don't know much about it. I have heard the director's name referred to as "the great Stanley Kubrick" many times, and I know that he has received some sort of Academy Award nomination in some capacity for this film. But I am not that far into the film, and I don't know much about the context that it was shot in, or the context that Kubrick was in, or the context that he worked in.

In fact, I have never even seen the film. I know it is a Kubrick film, but I don't know much about it. I know that it is filmed in black and white, and that it is shot in London, and that it was shot in England. I know that they were filmed in many locations, but this is the first time that I have seen the film.

I also know that it is a one-take, one-shot film, and that there are many effects in the film that are not in the final cut of the film. I know that the film is a very long film, and that the film begins with this amazing tracking shot of two people walking in opposite directions. I know that the film is famous for ending with a mother and son standing next to a lake. I know that the film is famous for beginning with a shot of a man's face being cut off, and for ending with a shot of a man's face being cut off. I know that the film is famous for the scene where the man who is shot in the head is being carried out to his death, and for the scene where the man who is killed by the man who is shot in the head is being carried out to his death. I know that the film is famous for the scene where a man is shot in the head in a stairwell, and for the scene where the person who is shot in the head is walking up and down the stairs, and for the scene where the man is shot in the head is walking up and down the stairs. I know that the film is famous for the scene where the man who is shot in the head is being carried away, and for the scene where the man who is shot in the head is being carried away, and for the scene where a man is shot in the head is being carried away, and for the scene where a man is shot in the head is being carried away.

The United States has shouldered a great deal of the burden of maintaining the international order that enabled the postwar world to emerge from the ashes of the Second World War. The BRICS nations have the potential to repair and repair that order, but only if they learn to live within their own political and social systems. If they do not, they will not be able to afford the kind of international security, economic growth and development, and peace that were so important to the United States.

This isn't an opinion, but just an observation.

The United States and the rest of the West owe a great deal to the legacy of the Second World War, and therefore the United States is uniquely positioned to help them overcome the challenges they face in the twenty-first century. The United States is the only country that has national security concerns that extend beyond its immediate neighborhood. This is a substantial advantage for the United States and can be used to leverage its natural economic, political, and military advantages.

The United States has a unique opportunity. Its economy, its military strength, and its global influence are more than adequate to achieve its national security goals. It has an advantage in that it has not suffered from the recurring waves of instability and chaos that have plagued the region for years. It has many advantages in that it has a healthy and stable political system, a relatively healthy and stable economy, and a healthy and stable alliance system. It also has many advantages in that it can leverage its economic, political, and military advantages to help the BRICS nations develop their own political and economic systems.

The question is, how do we use this advantage to get the BRICS nations out of their current rut?

The answer is to leverage the presence of the United States to help them develop an international system that is based on the rule of law, economic growth, and civic engagement. This system should be based on the rule of law because it is an essential component of civil society and the rule of law is not based on coercion. It is based on the right to privacy, the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, the right to assembly, the right to travel, the right to free decision-making, and so on.

The BRICS nations should be encouraged to pursue their own national interests and the interests of their citizens. They should be encouraged to create their own institutions that are responsive to their own needs and their own political and economic systems. But they should also be encouraged to cooperate with the United States in safeguarding the rule of law, building economic growth, building a stronger and more democratic political system, and promoting civic engagement.

The United States and the BRICS nations can leverage their collective power to make peaceful and sustainable changes in the international system and to help the BRICS nations develop a unique and beneficial international order.

The United States has the opportunity to do this, and it will only be given to them because of their unique historical position.<|endoftext|>The National Rifle Association has once again been unabashed in its support of gun rights and its opposition to restrictions on the right to bear arms. But as the organization releases a new video, urging voters to support a constitutional amendment that would allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons in public, one group is making sure the NRA doesn't get away with misleading the public.

"The NRA released a video today that is misleading and blatantly false," said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, in a statement to The Huffington Post. "It has nothing to do with the Second Amendment, and everything to do with their reluctance to accept that common-sense gun laws are a reality, and that we must work together to make them a reality."

In its new ad, titled "Stop the Gun Grab," the NRA makes several claims. The first says that "80 percent of Americans say they want more guns in their homes." That's not true. According to a Gallup poll from last year, the majority of respondents (53 percent) said they didn't want more guns in their homes, while just 30 percent said they wanted more guns.

Nonetheless, the NRA is not backing down from its claim, and has promoted it in two online billboards.

The second claim in the video is that "everytown for gun safety says you shouldn't need a permit to carry a concealed weapon." The video doesn't tell the truth about that claim. In fact, the "everytown" name refers to the gun control group that does not oppose the NRA's position on guns.

The problem with the NRA's claim is that it's based on the "everytown" group's March 2012 report on concealed-carry permits. The NRA and all its media outlets picked up the report's claim that "over 90 percent of states" still require applicants to get a permit, and the NRA's video, which is made up of quotes from "everytown" and NRA staff, repeats that bogus claim.

A woman who was shot dead by police in San Francisco's Bayview district was not armed, according to a police spokesperson.

The shooting occurred at 9:33 p.m. Sunday, when officers were called to the area of Embarcadero Street and Whipple Street after responding to a report of a woman with a gun.

The unnamed woman died at the scene.

The police spokesperson told NBC Bay Area that the police officer who shot the woman "was not aware she was armed."

The woman, who was in her mid-20s, had a valid California concealed weapons permit, according to police.

The woman had a history of mental illness, was "unstable" and had been "involved in a domestic violence incident," according to police.

Her partner was not injured.

Rituals of Ingenuity is a quest in Skyrim. It is the first of the three new quests added with the Hearthfire add-on.

Quick Walkthrough [ edit ]

Talk to Eola and find out what you need to do. Head to the Temple of Kynareth in Riften to begin the ritual.

Detailed Walkthrough [ edit ]

Finding the Ritual [ edit ]

The Ritual is located in the ancient temple of Kynareth on Riften. To begin the ritual, you must speak with Eola, who is standing outside the temple. She will explain that you must find a gem, a staff, and a ring from inside the temple. If you do not have any of these items, you can purchase them from her for 1,000 gold each.

The Gem [ edit ]

Eola will point you to a side room in the temple where you can find the Gem. The Gem can be found on the altar on the northern wall of the room. She will point you towards the gem, and will then ask you to use the magic of the temple to find it.

Once the Gem is located, Eola will ask you to use the Gem to open an ancient pillar. Asking the priestess to use a staff will give you the Staff of Kynareth. If you ask to use a ring, the priestess will point you to the Ancient Gem.

She will then show you the Ritual's start, and will make the following comments:

"To begin the ritual, you must first find the staff, ring, and gem."

"Once you have found the staff, ring, and gem, you must activate it by placing it on the Ancient Pillar."

"Once you activate the Ancient Pillar, the ritual will begin."

"You can watch the ritual as it unfolds, or attempt to stop it from happening."

"If you can see the ritual, you can interrupt it."

"You can turn the ritual off at any time."

"You can restore the temple to its former glory by defeating the priestess."

"Once you've defeated the priestess, you can proceed to the next step."

After the Ritual [ edit ]

Once you've completed the ritual, you will be transported to the realm of the gods. If you are a worshipper of the gods, you will be rewarded with the power of the sun. If you are not a worshipper of the gods, you will be rewarded with the power of the moon.

(CNN) President Donald Trump has reportedly requested that former FBI Director James Comey testify publicly in front of Congress regarding his conversations with the President.

CNN reported that Trump has asked Comey to come before the congressional intelligence committees to testify publicly about his conversations with the President.

"I hope you can let this go," Trump told Comey, according to a report by The New York Times.

Comey told Trump in an Oval Office meeting in February that he was not under investigation for possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 election.

The White House has declined to comment on the report.

"We must face up to the fact that there are problems and that there are these difficult moments, but that we must face up to them," Hollande told a news conference.

"We must face up to the fact that there are problems and that there are these difficult moments, but that we must face up to them" French President François Hollande

"We must continue to work together. It has been a long and difficult period, but we must learn from each other, we must develop this country."

Hollande's remarks came a day after French authorities revealed that two of the terrorists responsible for the Paris attacks had been planning their attacks in France for several months.

The two brothers, Cherif and Said Kouachi, and one woman, Hayat Boumeddiene, were believed to have been planning the attacks for months, according to a French government source.

Hollande said the attacks were "a tragedy for our country, a tragedy for our people, and a tragedy for all of humanity."

"We must continue to work together. It has been a long and difficult period, but we must learn from each other, we must develop this country." French President François Hollande

"There's no doubt that the atrocities committed in Paris are an attack on us all. The terrorists wanted to strike at our societies, at our way of life and at our values," he said.

"They wanted to strike at our societies, at our way of life and at our values" French President François Hollande

Hollande also said the attacks were "a real shock to our society."

"There was no warning, no preparation, no plan. We have to learn from this, we have to avoid it happening again," he said.

The French president also called on Muslims to show "solidarity" with the victims of the attacks.

"I hope that Muslims around the world, including in France, will show solidarity and show the willingness to protect the freedoms that belong to us all, including to freedom of religion," Hollande said.

"We have to work together. It has been a long and difficult period, but we must learn from each other, we must develop this country." French President François Hollande

The attackers were said to have been planning to attack a string of targets in France, including the Notre Dame Cathedral, a Paris financial district, and the Louvre Museum.

Another attack was also thwarted. A third terrorist was killed by police on Sunday.

Hollande said the Kouachi brothers were not linked to the radical Islamic group ISIS.

"They had nothing to do with the Islamic State. They never took part in any military operations," he said.

The French president also praised the work of the French security forces for their "solidarity and solidarity" in the aftermath of the attacks.<|endoftext|>We've seen the first live-action trailer for the upcoming film 'Wonder Woman,' and it looks pretty damn awesome.

Wonder Woman was first introduced in the pages of the comic book 'Wonder Woman' by writer William Moulton Marston and artist Steve Ditko in 1941. The character was created by Marston and Ditko to be a female counterpart to the male superhero Captain America.

Wonder Woman has been one of the most popular characters in the DC Extended Universe, and we're liking the upcoming film a lot. A word of warning, however: The first trailer for the film doesn't do the character justice.

WARNING: The first trailer for 'Wonder Woman' is currently unavailable on YouTube.

The trailer is a little too long, so we recommend just watching it in the first 30 seconds. Basically, the trailer is a beautiful, powerful visual representation of Wonder Woman's badassery.

Greens Senator Larissa Waters has called on the Government to immediately join a United Nations International Criminal Court investigation into crimes against humanity committed in Myanmar, Myanmar's political system and the Rohingya Muslim minority in western Myanmar.

Speaking on the ABC's 7.30 program on Tuesday, Senator Waters said the UN court's investigation was both urgent and justified.

"There are a number of crimes that have been committed in the country, and the UN has been asked to do an investigation on that," she said.

"It's a matter of urgency."

Senator Waters is the co-chair of the Senate's Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Committee.

She said there was "no question" Australia had a role in the investigation.

"We can and we should be part of this," she said.

Here are the issues Senator Waters raised about the 1.3 million Rohingya people who live in Myanmar.

Beck's last words were "I'm going to jail" when she was attacked by Kevin Lannane, who has been charged with second-degree murder.

Lannane was a driver for UberX in Denver in June 2015.

He picked up Beck and an unidentified passenger for an Uber ride to the bar, but the passenger had to go to the bathroom. Beck decided to stay behind to wait for the passenger, and was attacked while she was waiting.

Lannane's account of what happened went like this: Beck got into the passenger seat, and the passenger began kissing her. But Lannane got out of the car and started to kiss her again. Beck pushed him away, and he grabbed her.

"I looked over and I saw him grab a small kitchen knife and just start stabbing me," Beck said. "Then he stabbed me. I think he tried to kill me."

Lannane then drove off, leaving Beck bleeding on the ground.

Cops were able to track him down through the GPS system in his car.

He told officers he did not intend to harm Beck, but was trying to protect himself.

Lannane was found guilty of second-degree murder.

"I was surprised," Beck's father, Jeff Beck, told ABC News. "I never saw it coming."

Uber did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.<|endoftext|>Radiohead's Colin Greenwood discusses the iconic "Creep" track.

Following on from the brilliant "Creep" video, Radiohead have released a new version of the infamous "Creep" track.

Taking a cue from the video, the new version features the band's long time guitarist Colin Greenwood.

In an interview with BBC Radio One, Greenwood explained how the track first came into being: "The first time I heard it was in the old Radiohead sessions at Apple Corps. It was a bit of a joke, really. The Jonny Greenwood version was actually the first version I'd heard.

"I suppose that's what I think it's about. It's about paranoia. It's about relationships, and how you adapt to things. It's about being curious and sometimes not knowing what you're looking for or what's going to happen."

While it's a welcome return to the band's former signature style, the new version is unfortunately not as catchy as the original.

Earlier this year, Radiohead previewed their next album, which is expected to be announced later this year. The group is also currently on tour in support of The King of Limbs. You can watch the band's recent tour dates below:

Saiki Kadashima has been making music for over 30 years. She's been a part of some of Japan's most famous bands like Seiko, AKB48, and Omoi. She's been in a lot of large venues, including the Budokan and the Tokyo Dome, and she's performed with some of the biggest names in the music industry.

So, of course she's excited to announce her new album, "The Reasons," which is out on June 24 via Island Records. Here's what she had to say about it when we sat down to chat with her:

I'm excited to be releasing my first new album in over a decade, but the reason I'm so excited is that I feel like we've been working on it for a very long time. In fact, I started writing it when I was in high school. I was writing songs that were about my experience in high school, but I didn't know how to put them together. So I just tried to keep writing songs that were about high school. But as I was writing, I was thinking, "Why can't I make a record that's about my life today?" And that's what I'm doing.

I think the main reason I'm excited to be putting out my new record is that I'm excited to finally be able to make a record that's not just about that one time I was in Tokyo and did really well. That's why I'm excited to release "The Reasons," because I think that's the first time I've been able to make a record that's not just about one moment. I'm not just writing about the most important thing in my life, but the most important thing in my life is everything else, too.

We're probably going to hear the album in a few months, but I'm really excited to finally get it out there. I think it's going to be a really great record, and I hope you guys are as excited as I am.

Saiki Kadashima's "The Reasons" is out June 24. Pre-order it now on iTunes.

The U.S. has offered to sell Russia a barrel of its light sweet crude oil instead of natural gas. President Barack Obama has said that natural gas is the better fuel for powering a growing American economy.

"We have offered to sell them a barrel of U.S. light sweet crude oil instead of natural gas," the senior official said.

While the U.S. does not have any natural gas reserves of its own, it has been shipping natural gas to countries like Ukraine to save them from their dependence on Russian gas.

The U.S. also has offered to send Ukrainian troops to guard the flow of Russian gas through Ukraine.

But the offer did not appear to have gone over well with Russia, which said it was not interested in any swap.

"Based on our assessment, we have no interest in starting such talks," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in Tokyo.

The two countries have been locked in a dispute over gas supplies to Ukraine since early November.

Obama administration officials have said the U.S. has been dragging its feet in responding to Russian moves to seize Ukraine's Crimea from Ukraine.

The U.S. has offered only limited military assistance to the Ukrainian government, while Russia has provided military equipment and trained Ukrainian troops.

The White House has pushed for a diplomatic solution to the dispute, but its focus has been on economic sanctions. The administration has warned that any Russian economic or financial retaliation would be "catastrophic."

The U.S. also is considering a series of steps to increase the pressure on Russia, including a new round of economic sanctions, but has not made a decision.

The U.S. has also enlisted other countries to prevent large-scale Russian gas shipments to Ukraine.

The Russian gas company Gazprom has said it is willing to provide Ukraine with Russian gas, but only in exchange for an equal amount of Ukrainian goods.

Russia has said it will not pay for gas if it is delivered to Ukraine.

R. Kelly's daughter, Gianna, appeared on the cover of a new issue of Italian GQ (via Vulture). Gianna, who is 28, has long been a Kelly obsession. She even has a tattoo of her father's face on her leg.

Gianna admits that she's still "a little scared" of her dad after all these years. "When I first started, I just wanted to learn how to dance," she said. "His songs are so amazing that I'm still learning so much. His voice is the best. It's also these super-intelligent girls, who are like my little sisters."

Gianna, who has a T-shirt with Kelly's face on it, even appeared in Kelly's music video for his hit "Ignition (Remix)." The video featured her dad and "The Beautiful People" singing along to the lyrics of the song.

In 2012, there were 17,102 ER visits involving non-life-threatening injuries, compared to 12,958 in 2011.

"I think it's a reflection of the economic downturn in the province," said Dr. Dan McTeague, head of the BC Emergency Health Services (BC EHS) division.

"People are at home more often, are spending less time at work, and it's that combination of factors that we're seeing."

The numbers are based on the province's Health Insurance Act.

McTeague said the figures were a surprise because the province had been seeing a decline in ER visits.

"There was a lot of confidence that the economy would improve," he said.

"It was a shock to see the numbers go up."

The province's economy contracted by 1.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2012 and the economy began to recover in July.

Doctors, nurses, paramedics, and others in the health care system had a busy summer during the annual general meeting of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC earlier this month.

Dr. J.A.R. Gurney, BC EHS chief executive officer, said staff are busy responding to patients from a number of different sources.

"We're seeing a lot of people who are affected by job loss and who have lost their benefits," he said.

Health Minister Terry Lake said the province is doing everything it can to help people through the downturn.

"We've seen a significant reduction in the number of people coming to the ER, as well as the number of people who are seeking medical attention in other places," he said.

"That's part of the reason why the ER is under pressure, but we're doing what we can to make sure that we're providing the best possible care to our people."

Lake said while the province is still in the process of assessing the number of people who've sought care outside the ER, he believes a number will be released soon.

The province has been working with the BC Association of Health Plans to develop a number of recommendations to help improve the system.

Those recommendations include improving the billing process for patients and doctors, creating a single, electronic medical record for everyone, and giving health care providers access to additional resources to help them respond to emergencies.

The BC EHS division is currently reviewing the recommendations.<|endoftext|>This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

The Canadian Press


TORONTO - Ontario's Liberal government has begin its search for a new auditor general, a move that will likely trigger a constitutional fight with the province's opposition parties.

The government fired the auditor general of Ontario last year, saying he was unqualified for the job and had been a partisan in his past work.

The opposition parties are now asking the Supreme Court to block that decision.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has only appointed one outside auditor general in its history, and they have yet to appoint a replacement.

The Liberal government says it will now appoint an "independent" auditor general to replace Frank Gunn, who was appointed in 2014 to a five-year term and had been due to retire in April 2018.

The government will not say who that person will be, pending a decision on who the new auditor general will be.

But the opposition is not happy about the move.

"The Liberals have only been in power for a year, and this is a new approach by the government," said New Democrat MPP Gilles Bisson.

"The government has decided to go through the courts to try and avoid making a decision that is completely within their authority. The government made a pretty good decision in firing the auditor general, and they should stick to that decision."

The NDP, Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner and Liberal MPP Rachael Harder say they are concerned about any move by the government to appoint a partisan as the new auditor general.

"We will be watching carefully as to whether or not this government is going to appoint someone that they know is going to be a partisan," said Harder.

The Liberals have said they will only appoint someone they believe is qualified, and that it is up to the courts to decide who the new auditor general will be.

The opposition parties argue that's not enough.

"It appears the government is trying to seek out a partisan person to try and win this court case, and that is not how we want to do business," said Bisson.

The government has said it will continue to pay the salaries of the auditor general and the deputy auditor general until Gunn's replacement, and that's what it will continue to do.

Gunn, the former Progressive Conservative minister in charge of the Office of the Auditor General, was appointed to the position in 2014.<|endoftext|>Chinese President Xi Jinping | Alex Wong/Getty Images China seizes foreign assets amid U.S. trade dispute China on Tuesday suspended U.S. citizenship for people with dual citizenship in retaliation for U.S. sanctions targeting Beijing's financial system and other measures.

China on Tuesday imposed a sweeping new set of sanctions on U.S. citizens and companies, an escalation of a trade dispute that has escalated sharply during President Donald Trump's first 10 months in office.

The measures, which include an asset freeze and travel ban, are the most significant retaliation China has taken to date in response to the U.S. sanctions that have reportedly caused the biggest declines in the value of China's stock market in seven years.

The U.S. Treasury Department, which is carrying out the sanctions, said the measures were meant to "send a strong message to the Chinese government that the United States is committed to enforcing the laws of the United States."

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the measures were "a response to the U.S. administration's refusal to adhere to international law and take concrete actions for the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula."

A Pentagon spokesman said the U.S. military would continue to operate out of South Korea, and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said U.S. citizens in China would have access to consular services through their embassy.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the action is "a necessary and appropriate response to China's continued efforts to restrict commercial and financial activity of U.S. persons."

The announcement came shortly after Trump demanded in a tweet that China "Cancel all projects done in China in violation of the bilateral investment treaty."

The president, who has frequently criticized China as a currency manipulator on the campaign trail, has not publicly described the reasons for the new measures. But in a meeting with business leaders in New York on Monday, he singled out China as a key player in the growing trade dispute, according to a person familiar with the meeting.

Trump also told the business leaders he would impose stiff tariffs on imports from China, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

Chinese officials said the geopolitical stakes are high for the world's two largest economies, which have been trading increasingly competitively against one another for years.

The U.S. Commerce Department said the measures were an attempt to "put China back on a path of economic development that is fair, open, and reciprocal."

A bill that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Maine passed the Senate on Tuesday and now has to survive the House and be signed into law by Gov. Paul LePage.

The vote, which occurred late Tuesday night, was 20-10, with Sen. Garrett Mason, R-Lisbon Falls, the chief sponsor of the bill.

The bill, Senate Bill 594, would allow adults 21 and older to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana, grow up to six marijuana plants and give up to an ounce of marijuana to someone else. Those who over age 21 would still be subject to a federal law that prohibits the possession of marijuana, which remains illegal at the federal level.

The bill would also allow the use of marijuana in public places, including bars, restaurants, casinos, schools, movie theaters, stadiums, churches and other places that are open to the public, and would allow for the cultivation of up to six marijuana plants in private residences.

The bill is sponsored by Mason, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, who has said he'll try to put the measure through the Senate as he does with most of the bills he's sponsored.

Mason said his bill is aimed at dealing with the state's budget crisis, which has placed a $2.6 million hole in the state's general fund budget.

"We need to deal with the fact that we are going to have a budget shortfall of more than $1 billion, and we are going to have to find a way to deal with it," he said during the debate.

Mason said the bill is needed to help the state fund its methadone program, which has fallen short of the number of patients it needs to keep up with demand.

The state Department of Health and Human Services has said Maine should have a full-time methadone program funded through the General Fund, and the program is due to expire on June 30.

The bill's other sponsor, Sen. Eric Brakey, R-Auburn, defended the bill, saying that Maine is at a "serious crossroads" and needs to address the state's drug problem.

"The fact that we are in a crisis situation and we have to deal with it before it spirals out of control, that's what this bill is about," Brakey said.

However, Brakey said he didn't agree with the idea that the bill is primarily aimed at dealing with Maine's drug problem and that part of the bill is just about treating people with drug abuse problems.

"I don't think you're going to find a single person in this chamber who would vote for this bill just because it's for drug abuse treatment," Brakey said.

Mason said the Department of Health and Human Services has said it hopes Maine will have a full-time methadone program by fiscal year 2019.

"This is a crisis and we need to get this right," Mason said. "Marijuana is an alternative to opiates and it does not have the dangers associated with opiates."

Sen. Sue Leffingwell, D-South Portland, said she voted against the bill because she didn't feel the Legislature was giving Maine enough time to study the issue.

"I haven't seen a study that says this is going to be a popular thing," Leffingwell said. "We have a mentality that we're going to go ahead and legalize it now. If the Legislature is not going to do it now, then what is the point of having a bill that we can go back and amend?"

Maine's delegate to Washington, Rep. Mark Dion, D-Portland, voted against the bill along with the other Democrats. Dion said he didn't have a problem with legalizing marijuana but he did have a problem with how the bill was written.

"This is a very problematic bill," Dion said. "It's not about marijuana, it's about the way it's been written. It's of the opinion that this bill is not a sound bill."

The Senate is expected to vote on the bill on Friday, and the House is expected to take it up on Tuesday.

The lawsuit, filed in a Sacramento court, charges CalPERS with fraud, asking for a permanent injunction prohibiting the fund from withholding pension payments and returning the funds to the employees.

Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the lawsuit is the latest action in the ongoing investigation into the fund's alleged practices.

"When pension funds are allowed to break the law and defraud their own workers, the public is harmed," Becerra said in a statement.

I was surprised to see that The Atlantic had an article on this issue, and I thought it would be good to address the question that was raised in the article. I do not know what the authors of the article intend to do with the conclusions they are drawing, but I am afraid that what they argue seems to constitute a kind of "skepticism" of the whole idea of "unitary moral progress" as a program, as a way of thinking about morality, in relation to which many of the most important historical developments in the history of ethics have been made.

So let me begin with a brief history of this question. The question of "unitary moral progress" was raised by John Stuart Mill and Walter Lippmann in the early part of the 20th century and was made the subject of a major debate between Mill and Lippmann, set off in the early 1930s by Lippmann's attempt to establish the validity of Mill's argument (which he called the "Eisenstein thesis") and which was first discussed in detail by M.E. Schlegel in his essay "The Problems of Unitary Morality" in his collection of essays on "Theory and Practice of Ethics" in the 1930s. The debate between Mill and Schlegel, and between Lippmann and his former student, the Austrian philosopher Hans Kelsen, has never been settled, and there have been many different versions of it. But there is a general consensus with respect to the general thrust of Schlegel's theory.

Schlegel's basic idea is that in order to understand the ways in which moral progress is taking place, we must understand the concept of "moral progress." His basic idea is that in order to understand the ways in which moral progress is taking place, we must understand the concept of "moral progress." But the concept of "moral progress," as currently understood, is problematic. It is not a concept that is widely understood in any kind of unified way. So if we want to examine the question of moral progress in an objective, systematic way, we need to make some kind of reference to something that is generally understood.

The problem is that the term "moral progress" is not well defined, and is best understood as meaning either "the degree to which the standard of right and wrong has become more and more a matter of settled opinion" (to use the phrase of Mill and Lippmann) or "the degree to which the moral sense has become more and more a part of the common sense." Both of these meanings of the term are problematic.

Both of these meanings of the term are problematic. Furthermore, it is hard to see how we can make any progress in the area of moral philosophy if we are not able to have a sense of the "common sense" of moral principles.

Both of these meanings of the term are problematic. Furthermore, it is hard to see how we can make any progress in the area of moral philosophy if we are not able to have a sense of the "common sense" of moral principles.

In order to avoid confusion, I want to call attention to the distinction between "the common sense" and the "common sense sense of moral principles." It is essential to understand what I mean by "the common sense of moral principles" in order to understand the point I am making in this article. This is not at all to deny that there are, in fact, some moral truths that are not widely accepted. But it is to deny that the common sense of moral principles can be used as a reliable guide to right and wrong.

As far as I can see, the problem with the concept of "moral progress" is not the concept of moral progress itself (which is obvious), but rather the way in which it is used. It is widely understood that there are moral truths that are not widely accepted. If we want to avoid confusion, therefore, it is important to understand what I mean by "the common sense of moral principles" in order to understand the point I am making in this article.

Let us consider the following questions. What, if anything, is the standard of right and wrong? What is the standard of good? Which standard is more important? What is the source

From the moment that I started working for the College, I've been a part of the culture. I'm from a small town in the Midwest, I've always loved games, and I've never had an issue with learning a new language or culture. I've always been interested in the hardware, the software, and the people. I was the only African-American in a group of 22 people from all over the world, and I didn't think it was going to be hard to adjust to the school and the culture.

The first week I was there, I had to go to the Office of Diversity, Diversity, Diversity. I was sent to the Office of Diversity because I had a photo of my family in my hall picture. It was taken when I was in high school, and I thought it was funny so I posted it. It was basically just me and my family in the picture, but because of the color of my skin, I was labeled as a 'racist' and I had to remove the picture.

My first day in the Office of Diversity was the first day I was in the building. I had a lot of questions about the culture and how with me being the only African-American in my group of 22 people, I had to go to the Office of Diversity for help. I had all of the white kids and the white staff, and I didn't know what to do. I had a lot of questions about what was going on. There was never a lack of diversity there. I was the only African-American in the group. I had to go to the Office of Diversity to find out who was going to help me.

The first day I was there, I went to the Office of Diversity and I asked for help with my first class. I had to go to the Office of Diversity to help me with my first class because of the color of my skin and the fact that I was the only African-American in my group. I was the only one. The Office of Diversity was just another group of people just trying to help me. They were just trying to help me. I got in trouble for posting a picture of my family. I was just trying to help the students who were helping me.

We were in the same class for the first three weeks. I had a lot of trouble with the curriculum. I went home and I was crying about it. My mom said, "Are you crying because you're in the African-American History class?" I said, "Yeah," and she said, "I wish you were white because you would have been in a different class." My first week in the class, I was so confused and I didn't know what was going on. I knew a lot of the people there, but I didn't realize what was going on. I was so confused and I didn't know what was going on.

When I got to my last semester, I had to go to the Office of Diversity and tell them that I had to move to a different class because I had to go to the Office of Diversity to help me with my first class. But it was about my first class. They were making it very clear to me that I had to move to a different class. I was like, "What do you mean I have to move to a different class? I'm in the same class?" They were like, "Correct. You are in the same class." I'm like, "Why?" They said, "Because you are the only African-American in the class."

They told me that they were sending me to another class, but I was like, "No. No way. I have to go to the Office of Diversity to help me with my first class." They're like, "We understand. We understand. We understand." So I went to the Office of Diversity and I said, "Okay, I have to go to the Office of Diversity to help me with my first class. Where do I go?" They told me, "Well, I don't know. We'll figure it out."

The first semester, I had to go to the Office of Diversity to help me with my first class. I was there for three weeks. I had a lot of problems with the curriculum.

The House of Representatives began a week of recess with a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.

The House bill, H.R. 1, was introduced by Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) on Tuesday.

The House bill, called the American Health Care Act, would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

"This bill is a top priority for the Trump Administration and I am grateful the Senate will now take up its work to repeal and replace Obamacare," MacArthur said in a statement.

"I look forward to working with the Senate and the Trump Administration to deliver relief to the American people."

The bill would roll back several key parts of Obamacare, including its Medicaid expansion, its insurance subsidies and its taxes.

It would fully fund the Children's Health Insurance Program, which funds health coverage for 9 million children, and allow states to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's mandates on certain health insurance plans.

The House bill, which is similar to a Senate version, would be subject to a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.

The Senate passed a previous version of the bill in late May, but the chamber is currently in recess until June.<|endoftext|>The Chinese Government has been testing the use of genetically modified mosquitoes to fight malaria, in a move that could also help fight the spread of Aids.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences reported in its journal, PNAS, that a genetically modified mosquito was released in a laboratory in Jiangsu, in western China, on 1 October.

The mosquito was a male that had been genetically modified to produce an enzyme that killed the malaria parasite. It was sprayed with tropical forest oil and necessary nutrients near its home in the wild.

The researchers found that the modified mosquitoes had a "strongly diminished ability to transmit [malaria]".

They also found that the modified mosquitoes were able to "recover" the chemicals they had been sprayed with, and that they were able to breed with the wild males.

The experiment was carried out with the National Centre for Biological Control in Jiangsu.

"This is the first time we have developed a mosquito that is able to keep its genetically engineered ability to transmit [malaria] for long periods of time," said Professor Wu Xinren, a leading malaria researcher at the National Center for Biological Control.

Dr Andrew Lee at the University of California, Davis, said the results were "encouraging" but warned that the research needed to be replicated in other places.

"The paper is a very nice example of how to do research in China," he said. "The paper says they have managed to produce a genetically modified mosquito that can reproduce and lay eggs, which is a key step forward in the fight against malaria.

"It is an important step but the paper doesn't say whether these mosquitoes are actually going to be used to control malaria or not. That is the next step and I would be very wary of reading too much into this study yet."

Dr Lee said there was a danger that the research could be exploited by Chinese authorities to create a genetically modified sex-ratio of mosquitoes in order to control malaria.

"For China, this is a good thing," he said. "It is providing a tool that could be used for traditional control of malaria."

However, he said that the genetically modified mosquitoes were not likely to be used to control malaria in the future.

"The discovery of this new mosquito could be used to make mosquitoes that are resistant to the parasite, but that would be a big breakthrough for malaria but it is also going to be very expensive," he said.

"There is a huge cost involved in producing this and if you are going to conduct these kinds of research, you need to get it done in a controlled way. There are a lot of technical challenges and it would be unwise to conduct this kind of research in a way that would not be approved by the government."

Dr Lee said the research was also unlikely to prevent the spread of Aids in China.

"The Chinese government is very concerned about the spread of Aids," he said. "They know that the Aids epidemic is a new disease and they are very interested in combating it.

"In the long run, it is quite likely that the introduction of genetically modified mosquitoes will lead to the development of resistance to the Aids virus and the spread of the virus will be more difficult."

The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of genetically modified organisms to control infectious diseases, but Dr Lee said that the results of the Jiangsu experiment could help inform its views on the matter.

"The WHO has been giving some advice [regarding genetic modification] in the past," he said. "They have been saying that we don't recommend it because there are concerns about the spread of resistant viruses and pathogens and we don't know whether the introduction of

The City of Joliet is releasing a new program to help residents with high-risk, chronically homeless people. The program is called "Joliet's Safe Place," and it's the first of its kind in the country.

The program can be accessed through the city's mobile app.

Officials say the goal of the program is to provide short-term housing in a safe and supportive environment. The program is intended to allow people to maintain their dignity while they transition from homelessness to housing.

The program is designed to offer a safe place to stay that provides basic services to help people maintain their health, housing and personal safety.

Officials say the program is based on the notion of housing first, health second. People to be housed are first screened to determine their medical needs. They then receive health care while they are in the shelter.

Once housed, they will receive a medical assessment and follow-up care. They will also be provided with referrals to other agencies that provide needs-based services, including mental health and substance abuse.

THURSDAY: The Mets and Gonzalez are closing in on a deal, reports Jon Heyman of CBS Sports (on Twitter). The sides are expected to finalize an agreement soon.

MONDAY: The Mets and Hector Beltran are close to a new deal, according to Jon Heyman of CBS Sports (on Twitter). Heyman cites a source to confirm that the sides are in the final stages of closing a deal.

Beltran, 36, is coming off a season in which he batted .288/.326/.543 with 21 homers and 31 doubles for the Royals. Overall, he recorded a total of 741 plate appearances, including 348 starts. Beltran also set career highs in on-base percentage (.381) and slugging percentage (.578).

Should the deal come together, Beltran will be returning to New York for the first time since his 2008 trade to the Mets. He batted .286/.339/.503 with nine homers and 23 doubles for the Mets in 2009.

The Mets were looking to move Beltran prior to the February deadline, but his contract was not up for renewal. In fact, the two sides didn't even discuss a potential trade until last week, when the Royals asked for a three-year, $36MM deal.

As it stands, the Mets will have to eat a portion of Beltran's $13MM salary in 2013 and $14MM in 2014. While Beltran played some left field in 2013 (.258/.353/.389), he batted right field in 69.1% of his starts. Given the lack of an obvious platoon partner at that position, Beltran's bat likely played a role in the Mets' thinking when they decided to move him.

Beltran, a two-time All-Star, is still owed $18.5MM in the last three years of his contract, according to MLBTR's Free Agent Tracker, and it is unclear how the Mets would handle the remaining $21.5MM. The Mets could exercise a $4MM club option for 2014 or wait until 2015 to exercise the $4MM buyout.<|endoftext|>WASHINGTON — More than a month after a federal judge blocked President Trump's executive order on immigration, the White House announced on Friday that he would be "revised" and delayed.

The White House's statement, which did not specify what the president meant, came a day after a federal appeals court refused to reinstate the part of the immigration order that had been suspended.

The White House said that Mr. Trump had directed his new homeland security secretary, John F. Kelly, to "amend or rescind" the executive order. The announcement was made by Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, on Friday evening. At the news briefing on Friday, Mr. Spicer said it was "a matter of time" before the order was reinstated, and noted that Mr. Trump's advisers had been working on the issue for about a week.

"The president has been very clear with the DHS secretary that he's going to keep that department strong and well-funded and he's going to get the secretary to implement that order in a way that makes sense for the American people," Mr. Spicer said.<|endoftext|>A woman wearing a hijab leaves her home in New York last week.

The White House issued a statement on Thursday evening condemning the deadly terrorist attack at a mosque in Quebec City as an act of terrorism.

"The president said the following following," the statement reads:

"The United States condemns the terror attack in Quebec City. The people of Quebec City have demonstrated once again their commitment to religious freedom, and to tolerance, diversity and respect. The people of Quebec City will not be defined by this attack, and will continue to celebrate Canada's diversity, which is a source of strength and pride for all Canadians.

"We are closely following the situation in Quebec and stand in solidarity and partnership with the people of Canada. We continue to condemn all acts of terror – of whatever cause – that target civilians, whether they be acts of domestic terrorism or acts of international terrorism. And we will continue to honor our commitment to fight terrorism worldwide and to work with all partners to confront the true threat of terrorist groups like ISIL."

The president's statement on Monday was immediately criticized for not calling the attack an act of terrorism, which was the standard wording he had used previously.

Apart from the criticism of his use of the word "terrorism," Trump's statement also did not fully address the issue of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the United States.

"I'm very proud of the fact that we are the first state in the country to pass a law that allows parents to opt their kids out of vaccinations," said Gov. Jerry Brown.

Parents can opt their children out of vaccinations, but it's a tough choice for many.

"People don't realize that if you don't have a kid, you can't opt out, and so that's why when you're talking about the full range of vaccinations, not just the flu shot, but the measles, the mumps, the rubella, which have all been linked to autism and serious problems," said KGO-TV's Steve Burton.

Following a state law enacted in 2014, parents who refuse to vaccinate their children will no longer be deemed responsible for the consequences of not vaccinating their children.

"I think it's an important step in the right direction to make sure that people are protected and that their children are protected and that we do everything we can to protect them," said Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins.

Supporters of the measure are thrilled by the legislation.

"It's very important that we don't have anything that causes people to be fearful," said Councilman Ed Chau.

But for some families, there are other concerns about the measure, as well.

"I have a question, and I hope you can answer this," said a mother who asked to go by her first name, Yvette.

"I've heard that it's for religious reasons, and I have a view of how that works, but I know that I've heard that it's also for philosophical reasons," Yvette said.

Still, supporters of the law say it's an important step in protecting public safety.

"We should not be fearful of that. We should be fearful of people who actually want to harm us and our kids, and that's the people that want to do harm, and that's what this bill is for," said Assemblyman Jeff Gorell.

The bill has passed the state Assembly and is expected to be signed by the governor.<|endoftext|>The current political ad industry has created a new marketing paradigm for political campaigns, which is how best to sell the indefensible.

"It's not a coincidence that the first ads for Republicans started being shot in May," said Joe Trippi, a Democrat who managed George W. Bush's 1992 presidential campaign. "They're going to be the ones running these ads."

This year's Republicans are confounding expectations, tripping over themselves to reach more voters in places that previously would not have heard of them.

Republicans have been trying to build a coalition of voters who are not yet registered to vote. The party's leadership hopes to capture young people, the lower-income voters, and ethnic minorities by reaching out to them in diverse places where they don't normally interact.

The campaign has made a few moves that suggest it is paying attention to its challenges. The Republican National Committee is building out campaign operations in 24 states with a focus on minority communities, which could help attract votes in places like North Carolina, Michigan, Georgia, and Texas.

The RNC has also been investing in the digital side of its operation. It is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to buy Web ads that target likely voters and try to persuade them to back the GOP nominee.

WWE Smackdown from last night.

Last night's Smackdown was a solid show. It was a continuation of what people saw last week and on the previous show on Monday Night Raw. It had the same matches that people saw on Raw, but it was also kind of a meta show. I was kind of hoping for some more wrestling in the show, and Smackdown delivered on that. They got the matches that they wanted to get, they played a good game with the backstage segments and they did a good job of filling up the evening. It was a solid show.


If you want to watch the show, check it out on the WWE Network. It was a good show.


PWInsider.com has the full episode of Smackdown from last night.


I don't really know what to make of this. It's obviously a WWE show, and it's a pretty good one. But it is also obvious that WWE has been planning this one for a while.


The new WWE Smackdown has a lot of fun, but it wasn't really a show that I was all that excited to watch. I'm not sure I see the reason for it. It's not like WWE is trying to reinvent themselves or anything. They are still as successful as ever, and they are still bringing in good numbers. They are still putting on good shows, and I guess I'm fine with that. I'm just kind of wondering why they didn't do anything to change the direction of the show.


I guess the problem is that it was a lot of the same stuff that we've seen for the last couple of years. I don't know that I would consider this a bad thing. That's not the point, though. I mean, it's still a WWE show. It's just that it wasn't really a show that I wanted to watch.


The last few months have been a crazy roller coaster ride. I've been pretty sure that WWE would have to do something about the direction of the show. I'm not sure they have, though. The new Smackdown is still pretty much the same show. I think that the show is still exciting on its own merits, but it could be a lot more interesting if WWE would just do something to change the direction of the show.


I guess that we'll have to wait and see what the future holds for WWE. It's a good show, but it's not really that special, and I think that's something that I'm not a big fan of. I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but I think that this show needs some sort of shake-up.


In the meantime, I am going to enjoy this show. I'm not going to go out of my way to watch it every week. But it's kind of a cool show.<|endoftext|>WWE.com

John Cena will return to the ring at WrestleMania 31.

"It's a very special night for me. WrestleMania is one of the biggest nights on the calendar of my life. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Cena told WWE.com. "And it's a very special night for my family who's watching from home. For the fans who go to the show, it's a very special day, too. It's like a Super Bowl, except with a lot less football. It's a celebration of everything I've worked for my whole life, and it's a very special day for everyone here."

Cena was the main event at WrestleMania 31 in 2007, and since his return to the ring, he has delivered major moments, including a perfect 10-0 streak against The Undertaker, the first-ever Triple Threat Match, and his one-on-one match against The Rock at WrestleMania 27. His return to the ring will come on WWE's biggest night of the year, and he knows that WWE fans are eagerly anticipating his return.

On the one hand, you have the Liberal Party of Canada, which has been in power in Ottawa for almost a decade.

On the other hand, you have the New Democratic Party (NDP), which has been in power in Ottawa for only a single year.

The Liberals claim to represent the interests of Canadian business, the NDP the interests of Canadian workers. The NDP claims to represent the interests of Canadian students, the Liberals the interests of Canadian business.

The latter claim is problematic. Businesses are no longer the driving force of the Canadian economy.

The current Liberal government has presided over the worst economic performance of any post-World War II government. The previous NDP government was worse.

The current Liberal government's economic record is no better.

The NDP has been the beneficiary of a relatively cheap Canadian dollar, which has made Canadian exports more competitive.

However, it is no coincidence that the NDP has enjoyed a relatively weak economy since the Liberals took power.

In the last five years, the NDP has enjoyed record government spending. That spending has not succeeded in balancing the books.

Since the Liberals took power, governments have been spending more than $1 billion a month.

In the last five years, the government has spent more than $2 billion a month.

The Liberal government has increased corporate taxes and introduced a host of new taxes on small businesses — taxes that the NDP has opposed.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to a new documentary that's opening in Toronto, the first in a series based on the book, The System Was Dead. The film, called El Salvador: A Hidden History, follows the journey of a film crew investigating the government's role in the mass murder of thousands, and the role the United States played in supporting the Salvadoran military during the 1980s. The two Americans who make the documentary are filmmaker Brian Urquhart, who is a former U.S. military intelligence officer who helped track down and kill El Salvador's most notorious terrorist, Manuel Noriega, and investigative journalist Amy Goodman. The film is screening tonight at the Don Mills Cinema in Toronto, the first screening in Canada of the film.

Today we bring you an excerpt from the film that focuses on the role of the United States in the deadly wars in El Salvador and Guatemala. In El Salvador, the primary targets were the left-wing guerrilla groups, the FMLN, or the FML. The U.S. government provided military support to the Salvadoran military, funding the military's counterinsurgency program and training its elite forces. In addition, U.S. officers served as advisers to the Salvadoran military.

After the military government was overthrown by the FMLN in 1980, the U.S. government maintained a presence in El Salvador until 1992, when the FMLN won an election that brought a new president, Porfirio Díaz, to power. As of today, the U.S. has a military base on the island of Vieques in El Salvador, where U.S. Marines are stationed, training Salvadoran forces in counterinsurgency. Over the course of the film, we'll hear from Brian Urquhart, documentary filmmaker and human rights activist, as well as Amy Goodman, investigative journalist and host of Democracy Now!

Brian Urquhart has been a human rights activist for over 30 years, and he's been investigating the U.S. role in Latin America since the early 1980s. He's written many books about U.S. policy in Latin America. In addition, he has produced documentary films about U.S. military involvement in Central America. He recently made a film about the U.S. role in suppressing the Shining Path guerrillas in Guatemala, and he's currently preparing a film about the U.S. role in Latin America.

Welcome to Democracy Now!, Brian Urquhart.

BRIAN URQUHART: Thank you.

AMY GOODMAN: You've been investigating U.S. military involvement in Latin America for years. Could you tell us about your research, your research for this documentary?

BRIAN URQUHART: Sure. Well, the military-intelligence relationship was very, very clear during the Reagan years. It was kind of like the Cold War. And it's been a very strong relationship, since the '80s, which I think is very important to understand. And it really, in some ways, underlines the role of the United States in Latin America, that there are certain areas in which the United States tries to control the political process, but it also also has a very strong relationship with the military, particularly in El Salvador and Guatemala. And the military is very, very, very integral to U.S. foreign policy.

AMY GOODMAN: So tell us about those areas that you have uncovered in El Salvador, Brian.

BRIAN URQUHART: Well, for example, in El Salvador, the U.S. military was very heavily involved in training the Salvadoran army. And at the time, the U.S. military was very much involved in training at least, in the late '80s and early '90s, the Salvadoran army. And one of the things that I tried to do in the film, was to show the different types of training, from both the U.S. and the Salvadoran army. And one of the things that I found especially interesting is that, if you look at the training that there was to the Salvadoran army in the '80s, the training was very, very hard-core. I mean, it was very, very hard-core, with a lot of military combat training and sniper training, and it was very, very difficult. And if you look at the training that the U.S. military did in El Salvador, it was much softer, much more about negotiation and de-escalation and counterinsurgency. And, you know, in many ways, the training that the U.S. military did in El Salvador, was very similar to the training that the U.S. military does in Central America.

AMY GOODMAN: So, in El Salvador, the military was essentially training the military. That's what you're telling us about.

According to the latest data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, there were 1,808,744 crimes in the United States in 2015. Of those crimes, 160,779 were violent crimes and 88,269 were property crimes.

The FBI's crime statistics do not include the number of "justifiable" homicides, which includes police-related homicides, as well as the number of crimes for which the victim lives in a different state, or is under 18 years of age, or is a victim of a sexual offense. The FBI only counts murders and nonlethal crimes like aggravated assault, robbery, and larceny.

On Tuesday, fans will be able to vote for their favorite candidate.

But the decision is far more complicated than picking between three people.

My initial thought was that the shortlist of three candidates was the most straightforward and straightforward way to get a decision. But that was before I started digging.

The following is a list of factors that could play a role in who wins the job. I won't get into them all here, but I can explain why some candidates are more desirable than others.

Personality

The most important and the most widely discussed factor in the search is personality.

Some candidates have more experience on the job than others, and the best candidates will be able to communicate at a high level with the fans.

The best candidates will be able to communicate at a high level with the fans. The best candidates will be able to communicate at a high level with the fans. The best candidates will be able to communicate at a high level with the fans. The best candidates will be able to communicate at a high level with the fans.

So if personality is the most important factor in the search, who does the UNC football program need?

I'd say two people.

I'd say two people.

Because of their personalities and the way they interact with fans (or the media), I think Todd Graham is the best fit for the job.

Todd Graham's personality is the reason why he won the job at NC State. He was a big personality and an engaging personality.

Early in his tenure, he was very outspoken. He was not afraid to tell the media what he thought. He'd say, "NC State is a great place to be a student-athlete. Coach (Bobby) Cremins is a fantastic coach. I don't care who you support. You want to be a part of it."

He's not afraid to speak his mind.

It's why he gets credit for creating a winning culture, which is why we should hire him.

I also have a lot of respect for Larry Fedora, who was the head coach at NC State from 2005-09. He's a great coach and a very important part of the NC State football tradition.

But Fedora, like Graham, is also an engaging personality. He's not afraid to speak his mind, and he's very passionate about his job.

But Fedora is a much different person than Graham.

Graham is a master of the "he said/she said" story. He's not afraid to be honest.

He's not afraid to speak his mind.

He's not afraid to speak his mind.

And he's not afraid to be honest with the media.

He's not afraid to be honest with the media.

He's not afraid to be honest with the media.

Bobby Petrino is another great example. He's a big personality and a good communicator.

He loves his job and he loves his fans. He's a great communicator.

He was the head coach at Louisville from 1996-2003. He was the head coach at Louisville from 1996-2003.

Bobby Petrino is not afraid to talk to the media.

He's not afraid to talk to the media.

He's not afraid to talk to the media.

He's not afraid to talk to the media.

He's not afraid to talk to the media.

He's not afraid to talk to the media.

He's not afraid to talk to the media.

He's not afraid to talk to the media.

But his personality is not the reason why he won the job at Louisville.

He was the head coach at a great program, which he says he didn't want to be at. But he had to be the head coach at a great program. And he did it.

So when you're looking at personality, I think Graham is the best fit for the job. But Fedora is also a

His name is Jim. He's been an avid gamer for a long time, but it's only recently that he's started to take his love of the game to the next level.

"I was always a great gamer, but I never had the motivation," Jim said. "Now that I'm starting to get into video games and start getting better, I'm like, 'Oh, I can do this!'"

Jim is a self-proclaimed "gamer' who's obsessed with video games since he was little. He's a huge fan of games like Call of Duty, Halo and Dragon Age, but he's also a longtime fan of Nintendo games like Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, Super Mario Galaxy 2 and New Super Mario Bros U.

He's going to school to study gaming, but he doesn't plan on going to college just for gaming. He said he wants to be a real-life video game developer, like a game designer, and he has his eyes set on becoming a game designer.

"I'd like to work on games that people would actually want to play," Jim said. "I think it would be really cool to be a part of creating a game that people would actually want to play and be a part of making it happen."

His plan is to get his game design degree, which he's been working towards since he was in middle school. He started working on his game design plan last year, and he's already started paying off the bills.

He's currently working on a prototype for a new game, and it's all given him the motivation to continue to work towards a degree. He's also hoping to get his game design degree through the International Game Developers Association, which is a non-profit organization that helps people earn degrees in game design.

Jim says he's been playing games for most of his life. He started playing games when he was around two years old, and he's been playing games ever since.

"I think I was about 11 or 12 when I started playing games and really got into them," Jim said. "I started to play games like Super Mario Bros. and Zelda when I was three or four, and I played them all the time and I still did."

"I was always a great gamer, but I never had the motivation." - Jim

With his parents' help, Jim started to get into games. Jim says he's been playing games for as long as he can remember, and he's always had plenty of energy because of the games he loves to play.

"I've always been very energetic, and when I'm playing games, I'm very kind of happy," Jim said. "I like to always have a good time, and I like to feel like I'm having fun. I like to feel good."

Jim said his parents have been encouraging him to play more and more games, and he's been playing video games since he was a kid.

"I think they're very supportive of me," Jim said. "I think they love playing games, but I think they love playing games with me as well. I think they're very supportive of me and I think they're very supportive of me and my hobbies, and I think they like that because I think they appreciate it too."

Jim hopes to eventually work with his dad on his game design degree, and he's already been working on his plan to get his game design degree.

"My dad would be very supportive of my decision," Jim said. "He's always been very supportive of me as well."

Jim said he wants to be a game designer, and he's already started working on his game design plan. With a year left to get his game design degree through the International Game Developers Association, he already has the plans to get his degree through that organization.

The study looked at the relationship between a history of long-term smoking and the development of lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, laryngeal cancer, oral cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The researchers controlled for age, sex, education, body mass index, centre, and country. They found that smoking for more than 20 years increased the risk of lung cancer by 50 per cent.

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the Canadian population and is also a major cause of mortality, with 21,000 new cases diagnosed in 2010.

The study also found that smoking was associated with a 65 per cent increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer, as well as a 50 per cent increased risk of developing laryngeal cancer.

The US is poised to end the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade deal that has been negotiated by President Barack Obama for the past six years. The deal will be the largest trade deal the US has ever negotiated.

The announcement was made by US Trade Representative Michael Froman. He said the US would adopt a "much more robust stance" on the TPP, and was now making the decision to withdraw from the agreement.

"The decision to move forward on TPP was a difficult one for us to make," Froman said at a joint press conference with his Japanese counterpart, Vice Prime Minister and Economy Minister Shinzo Abe. "But in the end, it is in the best interests of the US economy, our workers, and our businesses."

The TPP was negotiated by the US and 11 other nations in the Pacific Rim. It was meant to boost trade and investment between the countries by lowering trade barriers and reducing import tariffs. As with all trade deals, the deal was not without its critics and critics have had a hard time convincing the US public and lawmakers to support the deal.

A new Japanese fashion company is creating some quirky clothing.

The clothing is all about the "kawaii" (cute) aesthetic, which means it's designed to be cute but also wearable. Most of the clothing is colorful and doodly, with a few designs, like this T-shirt, that are a little more interesting.

This T-shirt is available for ¥1,500 (US$15), and it's available in men's and women's sizes.

The clothing is made by the company "Kawaii Design," which started in 2011. The company sells apparel that can be worn by kids. The clothes are also made for adults, but they are cute, so they are sold only in the teenagers' section.

So if it's not practical, why does Elon Musk want to build it? He wants to sell it because he believes in the Model S—he's betting that it's the future of mainstream cars.

Musk's bet is that the Model S is the car that will finally make it possible to build a supercar that's affordable, practical, and sustainable. That's Musk's dream, and why he's so excited about the Model S.

But there's a problem: the Model S is not actually practical.

The Model S is a pure electric car. It's not much different from an Audi A4 diesel—except that it has superior

Call it the "Stingray effect."

For the past eight years, the United States has been at war with al-Qaeda and its allies in the Greater Middle East. But for nearly a decade, the U.S. has been able to track the group's hijackers through the vast network of embassies and consulates that dot the globe, enabling officials to determine the identities of the 19 men responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks.

But the U.S. government stopped monitoring the hijackers after they departed the country.

Now, with the release of secret documents by a group of activist journalists, the agency is expected to confirm the existence of the program. The documents provide a rare glimpse into the government's ability to track terrorists through the diplomatic network, a program that has been kept secret from Congress and the American public.

The documents, obtained by The Intercept through the Freedom of Information Act, show that the U.S. was able to identify and track the hijackers through the U.S. Consulate in Dubai, which was the hijackers' first stop in the region. The consulate has since been closed.

The documents also reveal that the hijackers were tracked by the CIA's "Global Entry" program, which allows diplomats and their families to travel directly to the U.S. without a visa.

In addition to tracking the hijackers, the documents show that the U.S. was also able to determine the identities and travel plans of the 19 men who were being held in U.S. custody in Afghanistan.

The revelation that the U.S. was able to track the hijackers in the region comes as the Obama administration is under fire for its broad surveillance of Americans and its failure to address widespread concerns about its use of the program.

"The government has long known that the U.S. government has diplomatic and intelligence relationships with many of the countries in the Middle East," said Congressman John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. "The truth is that the United States is losing our ability to provide intelligence that could have prevented the attacks."

The Intercept, a website run by First Look Media, a media organization based in Washington, D.C., published the documents on Friday. The documents are part of an ongoing collaboration between the site, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a group that advocates for press freedom.

The Intercept published the documents as part of its "first installment" of a project that is being called "The Drone Papers." The project is seeking to spotlight the secrecy surrounding the use of drones, which was first revealed by The New York Times in February.

The Intercept's first installment, titled "Drones Most Wanted," is a collection of stories about the use of drones by the U.S. government. The stories show the controversial aspects of the program, such as the use of drones to target American citizens without due process.

In addition to reporting on the use of drones, the project will provide background on the 9/11 Commission Report.

The first installment of the project is entitled, "Drones Most Wanted: The Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States."

The following are excerpts from the first installment of the project:

The information in this installment was obtained from the so-called "9/11 Commission Report" by the National Archives and Records Administration, a federal agency that is responsible for archiving government records. It was also obtained by The Intercept through the Freedom of Information Act.

The 9/11 Commission Report, released in 2004, was produced by the independent commission appointed by President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It was the only official government document available to the public for years after the attacks.

Much of the report has been classified. It was given to the public in 2004, but President Barack Obama deleted sections of the report that influenced the White House's counterterrorism policies.

Because the report was classified, the 9/11 Commission Report could not shed light on how the U.S. government developed its counterterrorism policies in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.

The document release is expected to provide new insights into the government's use of drones in the U.S. over the past decade. Documents from the 9/11 Commission Report showed that the U.S. had been extensively using remotely piloted aircraft in the war against al-Qaeda.

Nicknames: Unknown

Location: America

Date: November 8, 1990


Case Edit

Details: In 1990, a young woman named Julie Paul was found dead in a wooded area near her home in the town of West Haven, Connecticut. Her family had reported her missing in the hours before, but her parents thought she was still at school. The next day, her mother discovered that Julie had been missing for three days, and was found dead the next morning. Julie had been beaten to death, and her body was badly beaten. Police initially thought that Julie had been sexually assaulted, but it was later revealed that she had been killed by a blow to the head with a baseball bat, and that a large piece of her skull had been removed.

Suspects: Julie's family had reasons to be suspicious of their daughter's boyfriend, Kevin Saucier. It was Saucier's job to sell the stolen stolen cars to be sold on the black market and then to rob them. He had an extensive criminal record and had previously served time in prison for manslaughter, burglary, and robbery. He had also been convicted of having sex with the victim during the time she was missing. The murder was thought to have been committed by Saucier, although he had not been charged with the crime.

Extra Notes: This case first aired on the February 19, 1991 episode.

Results: Unresolved. Saucier was charged with Julie's murder in March 1991, but in September 1990, Saucier's brother, Mark Saucier, was charged with her kidnapping and rape.

The Supreme Court on Monday handed down a historic ruling that has huge implications for modern-day surveillance, allowing police to turn on and off the electronic devices of suspects in criminal investigations without first obtaining a warrant.

The ruling, which follows a pair of high-profile cases in the last year, makes it clear that the Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans from illegal searches and seizures, does not apply to electronic devices such as cellphones and other portable computing devices.

The ruling was unanimous: Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented.

The decision represents a significant change in how law enforcement conducts investigations, and has provoked a fierce debate, as well as questions about what it means for individual privacy and the right to privacy.

The court's decision is a huge victory for the National Security Agency and other spy agencies, which had argued that they are entitled to engage in "electronic surveillance" of people around the world based on secret court orders.

But it also opens the door to surveillance of Americans' private communications and information stored in the cloud, and to the possibility that criminal suspects, innocent bystanders and even foreign leaders will be subject to such surveillance in the future.

Despite the court's ruling, the government's powers to spy on electronic devices remain largely intact. In the most telling part of the ruling, in the context of the search of a suspect's phone, the court said that "the absence of any condition on the admission of evidence does not imply its inadmissibility."

"The police may use oral or written evidence obtained from a 'third party' (i.e., from an electronic device) to search a suspect's phone, without first obtaining a warrant to do so," Kennedy wrote. "The Third Amendment does not require the police to obtain a warrant before searching a suspect's phone."

Kennedy's opinion is a significant departure from the Fourth Amendment's requirement that search warrants be based on probable cause and that evidence obtained in the search must be suppressed if it is not relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.

The case is United States v. Warshak. (The Washington Post)

The ruling in the Warshak case centered around a 2012 arrest for drug trafficking in Baltimore.

Although police were called to the scene, and seized the phone in question, investigators later determined that the phone had been used by the defendant, Yassin Aref, to make calls to his family, friends and associates.

An independent witness was able to place Aref at the scene when the phone was seized, according to the court decision.

The court concluded that the phone was an "electronic device" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and that the police could use it without a warrant to search for evidence relevant to the investigation.

The ruling was also a victory for

Greece's governor has warned that, as a result of a $307m (£206m) bailout by international creditors, "Greece has developed a kind of double identity – on the one hand it is a sovereign state with a state tax system, and on the other hand it is a peripheral country that has been subjected to a fiscal narrative that it can't possibly fulfill".

The comments by Yiannis Stournaras, a former minister for finance, are a stark reminder of the huge challenges facing Greece as it tries to overcome the crisis that has engulfed the country.

The country is currently grappling with a €240bn (£177bn) bailout from international creditors, in return for a €130bn (£99bn) bailout from the European Union.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Stournaras warned that Greece was "not a country that can meet the national income targets that it has set for itself".

The country is also facing a €1.5bn (£1bn) cut in its planned pensions payment this year, which could further strain its finances.

However, while the country is struggling with the effects of the austerity measures that have been imposed on it, it has also benefited from a €27bn (£22bn) bailout from the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund.

Despite the heavy burden of debt that Greece has been forced to bear, Mr Stournaras admitted that "it's not a problem that can be solved with a magic wand".

He added: "What we need is to meet the debt targets we have set, which are in the order of €110bn. We have to do that without any interest in terms of debt servicing.

"What we are now seeing in western Europe is a new kind of debt crisis. It's not only Italy and Spain, but also France and the UK. It's not a problem that can be solved with a magic wand.

"We have to accept the fact that Greece is a peripheral country and has a deficit that's significantly higher than its GDP. We have to accept that Greece will not be able to pay back what it owes."

Mr Stournaras also pointed to the "very high fiscal crimes" that were committed by the Greek government.

"If we look at the Greek deficit, it's really not that great. In 2012 alone, the Greek government was obliged to repay €30bn, and this is before we take into account that it was the ECB that made the loans to the Greek government.

"That is very excessive and it's not sustainable. We had a government that made a lot of mistakes, but it wasn't the government's fault. When we look at the Greek government, we can see that it was a government that was focused on austerity.

"The Greek government was quite openly behind the debt management programme and the austerity programme, but it was the Greek people who were the ones who were meant to pay for the mistakes.

"It's a very tragic situation, because Greece has a double identity – on the one hand it is a sovereign state with a state tax system, and on the other hand it is a peripheral country that has been subjected to a fiscal narrative that it can't possibly fulfill."

Mr Stournaras, who is also a professor of economics at the University of Athens, also claimed that Greece had become a "pit of despair" as a result of its international bailout.

"We are seeing in Greece a kind of double identity – on the one hand it is a sovereign state with a state tax system, and on the other hand it is a peripheral country that has been subjected to a fiscal narrative that it can't possibly fulfill," he said.

"We are seeing a country where the political elite are governed by the rule of the silent majority, and where the people are obliged to carry the burden of austerity and debt repayment."

Mr Stournaras's comments come after the European Central Bank opened the door to further monetary easing, in response to the ongoing crisis.

The ECB announced on Thursday that it will now "look for ways to expand the monetary policy" of the eurozone, in a bid to support the eurozone's economy.

The ECB stressed that it was important to "reduce the risk of deflation in the euro area" – a key concern for Greece, whose economy is already contracting.

Meanwhile, Greece's new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, faced a backlash from opposition lawmakers after he said that the country does not need further financial assistance.

"We have a programme and we will stick to it. We will not seek to increase the debt, but rather reduce it," he told reporters at a news conference.

Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is expected to be formally appointed as the country's next finance minister by the end of the week.

The Greek government is facing a number

The map above shows the following estimates of the uncertainty around the RCP8.5 scenario:


The red lines show the range of simulated results from the CMIP5 ensemble members.


The ensemble members are made up of about 6,000 simulations of the same future conditions for the period 2035 to 2070. The grey bands are the uncertainty range.


The ensemble member with the smallest uncertainty is the member that was chosen to represent a warming of about 3.1 degrees Celsius. The member with the largest uncertainty is the member that was chosen to represent a warming of about 6.8 degrees Celsius.

The member with the largest uncertainty is the member that was chosen to represent a warming of about 6.8 degrees Celsius.

The CMIP5 ensemble members are also known as "climate projections" and are made up of about 2,000 simulations of the same future conditions for the period 2035 to 2070. The grey bands are the uncertainty range.


The ensemble member with the smallest uncertainty is the member that was chosen to represent a warming of about 3.1 degrees Celsius. The member with the largest uncertainty is the member that was chosen to represent a warming of about 6.8 degrees Celsius.

This uncertainty range is used for comparing different CMIP5 projections. The CMIP5 model projections are, in order of increasing uncertainty, the "high" and "medium" sensitivity scenarios, the "intermediate" and "low" (or "low") potential values scenarios and the "high" and "medium" equilibrium climate sensitivity scenarios.

The CMIP5 equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), which is the temperature increase that could be expected to result from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ).

The CMIP5 medium and high sensitivity scenarios represent scenarios that could be considered to be more likely than the "low" CMIP5 equilibrium climate sensitivity scenario. The "high" sensitivity scenario assumes a much faster warming than the "low" scenario. This means that the high sensitivity scenario results in a much larger temperature increase than the low sensitivity scenario.


The CMIP5 low and medium sensitivity scenarios represent scenarios that could be considered to be more likely than the "low" scenario. The "low" sensitivity scenario assumes a much slower warming than the "high" scenario. This means that the high sensitivity scenario results in a much smaller temperature increase than the low sensitivity scenario.

What is the difference between CMIP5 climate sensitivity estimates?

The CMIP5 medium and high sensitivity scenarios are more likely than the "low" CMIP5 equilibrium climate sensitivity scenario.


The CMIP5 low and medium sensitivity scenarios represent scenarios that could be considered to be more likely than the "low" CMIP5 equilibrium climate sensitivity scenario. The "low" sensitivity scenario assumes a much slower warming than the "high" scenario. This means that the low sensitivity scenario results in a much smaller temperature increase than the high sensitivity scenario.

How can the CMIP5 climate sensitivity values be compared?

The CMIP5 model predictions are, in order of increasing uncertainty, the "high" and "medium" sensitivity scenarios, the "intermediate" and "low" potential values scenarios and the "high" and "medium" equilibrium climate sensitivity scenarios.

So, I've spent the last week weeding out the dead wood in my home and office. I've changed my wardrobe. I've cleaned my closets and furniture and tools. I've gotten rid of some of my clutter.

Now, though, I'm staring down at my desk. I look around and notice that I have a lot of books, which I love. I also have a lot of papers, which I love to read. But, I've also got a lot of stuff in my bookcase.

I'm not sure what to do with it all. I'm not sure if I'm going to put it in a bag or a box. I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it or even throw it away.

So, what should I do?

To answer these questions, I thought we would start with a little history lesson.

For the next nine months, I will be collecting items that represent the diversity of my life. I'm not going to be picking out the books that I love so much and toss them out of the window. I'm not going to be picking out the papers that I read so much and throw them out of the window. I'm going to be collecting the things that I do that I love.

I'm going to be collecting a little bit of everything. But, I'm going to be doing it in a way that illustrates how, on a more personal level, I can collect these things.

So, now that we've established my collection, let's go back to the beginning.

How I Collected Things

Back in the day, I would collect things by just making piles on the floor, or by digging through the couch cushions, or by picking up small objects. I would take a drop of enthusiasm, or a few adrenaline shots, and I'd run around the house collecting stuff.

And, then I'd come home and look at what I had collected.

My mom gave me a book in a box when I was a kid. It was a little book of random drawings. I remember, as a child, I would look at it and be like, "Oh my god, that's awesome!"

I then got another book of random drawings in a box. I remember, as a child, I would look at that book and be like, "Oh my god, that's awesome!"

"The best thing that can happen to a man is to be loved by his own mother"

Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness the greatest action scene in history. And it is all because of a woman.

The scene — one of the most iconic was in the 1995 film "The Matrix" — occurs at the end of the film, when Neo stands up to Morpheus, the leader of The Resistance, and asks him to give up his soul.

Morpheus, a human-like leader of The Resistance, tells Neo that he is the embodiment of everything that is good in the world. This gift comes at a price, however: He must never reveal his true self to anyone.

Neo, who is Neo in disguise, asks him to give up his soul because he can't be the person he wants to be. Morpheus says that he can be that person.

But, in the end, Neo isn't willing to give up his soul so easily.

I've been thinking about this scene since I first saw it — and I'm not sure I like it. On one hand, it is awesome. On the other hand, the scene is a bit too much like the love triangle in "The Matrix."

Look, I understand that movies, when they are well-made, can do things that no other medium can do. And, yes, the love triangle in "The Matrix" is a fantastic scene.

But if you watch it back to back with "The Matrix," "The Bourne Identity," "The Dark Knight" and "The Matrix Reloaded," it's obvious that the two scenes are completely different.

Here's why.

"The Matrix"

"The Matrix" is a movie about a man and a woman who, in the near future, are forced to meet each other in a virtual reality world. They must choose to fight or run. They are forced to fight because they are the enemy.

Two people have died in a shooting that happened in the parking lot of a Spokane Valley mall Friday afternoon, police say.

The victims died around 5 p.m. at Providence Regional Medical Center, according to a news release.

The shooting happened in the parking lot of the Sears store, located near the mall's entrance.

A Spokane Valley police spokesman says the victims were two people who were shot in the parking lot. They were not immediately identified.

Police have not released any details about the suspected shooter or the suspect vehicle.

The mall said it had been informed of the shooting, and that it would be closed Friday.

"We are working with our security company to ensure that they remain on site and that they are on top of the situation," the mall said in a statement.<|endoftext|>PURPOSE:

The aim of this study was to compare the short-term effects of tianeptine, a unique N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, with placebo on the cognitive functions of healthy subjects.

METHODS:

Twenty-two volunteers were randomly assigned to receive tianeptine (50 mg) or placebo for 2 weeks. Cognitive tasks were performed at baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment.

RESULTS:

Tianeptine significantly improved the performance of attention (p = 0.01), working memory (p = 0.01), and executive functions (p = 0.01). Tianeptine improved the performance of attention and executive functions, but not working memory, in comparison with placebo. Tianeptine may have a beneficial effect on cognitive functions in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Tianeptine was associated with a significant decrease in heart rate at the end of the trial.

CONCLUSION:

Tianeptine may be a safe and effective drug for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.<|endoftext|>The US Senate on Monday overwhelmingly approved a sweeping new climate change bill that would divest from fossil fuels and place an economic value on the benefits of renewable energy.

The bipartisan bill, which passed the Senate with a vote of 75-20, would require federal agencies to adopt new rules to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 30% from 2005 levels by the end of this decade.

The bill also mandates that states increase their renewable energy investment rates to 20% by 2020 and 50% by 2025.

The Senate vote came a day after the House of Representatives passed the bill by a nearly two-to-one margin.

"This bill is a recognition of reality. The world is changing," said Senator Barbara Boxer, who co-sponsored the bill with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse.

"We can no longer wait and hope that President Obama's Clean Power Plan will save us from the worst impacts of climate change, and this bill is the first step to ensure that we do something about it," Boxer added.

The Senate bill hands over the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions to the states. Republican-led states have opposed the EPA's recent proposal to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants.

"While the Republican leadership has once again squandered years of hard work to build support for a clean energy future, this bill marks a significant milestone in that fight," said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club.

The bill defines a "greenhouse gas" as any substance that traps heat and can be regulated by the EPA.

"This bill is not just about climate change. It is about the economy," said Senator Tom Udall, a New Mexico Democrat and lead sponsor of the bill.

The Democratic-led Senate is expected to approve the bill as soon as Tuesday. It is expected to easily pass in the Republican-dominated House, where a similar bill already has bipartisan support.

The Senate bill is modeled on legislation introduced in 2010 by Boxer and Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat. The two co-sponsored the bill with 10 other Democrats.

The legislation passed the Senate in December with the support of all 33 Democrats and three Republicans.

The bill now moves to the House.

Praise be to Allaah.

The first thing that a Muslim should do is to pray and make du'aa' for the Muslims who are in a state of Ihram. This is an obligation that Allaah has placed on the believers, because of the special status that the Muslims hold over them.

With regard to their special status, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "Whoever visits me in my state of Ihram, visits me in my state of special status, and whoever is in a state of Ihram visits me in my state of special status." (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6365; Muslim, 656)

This indicates that the Muslims are under the protection of Allaah, and this is what is meant by special status.

The second thing that a Muslim should do is to follow the prayers and du'aa's that he was taught and is taught in his religion. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "The one who prays and makes du'aa' for me is like a person who has a disease in his body, and when the time comes for him to be freed, he is granted his freedom. So if he makes du'aa' for me, his du'aa' is accepted, and if he doesn't make du'aa' for me, his du'aa' is refused." (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6365; Muslim, 656).

It was said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): "What do you think about that man who prays and makes du'aa' for you?" He said: "I think that he is a kaafir (disbeliever) and I don't think that he will be granted his freedom." (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6320; Muslim, 656)

Rex Tillerson, the chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), is a former Republican senator from Texas and a close ally of Trump, who defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8.

Tillerson, 50, has more than 40 years of experience at Exxon Mobil, having served as chief executive of the company from 2006 to 2015, when he became chairman and chief operating officer.

Trump has said he would move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a declaration that would be seen by the Palestinians as U.S. recognition of their capital.

On Wednesday, Trump said he would seek to move America's embassy to Jerusalem, a decision that would upend decades of U.S. policy and upset

The size of the U.S. economy has improved over time, but we are not there yet, a new report from the Federal Reserve says.

The nation's gross domestic product is expected to grow 3.9% this year, up from the average of 2.1% seen over the last five years, the central bank said in its quarterly report on Tuesday.

That's a bounce-back from the U.S. economy's slow recovery from the Great Recession in 2009. Growth has averaged only 1.5% since 2009, and has been falling since the end of 2014.

The Fed's forecast, however, is still behind where it was in the middle of 2015, when it expected growth to turn around and average 3.7% over the next five years.

"Economic growth is expected to pick up in 2017 and 2018, with growth of 3.9% projected in 2018, up from the 3.5% projected in the October 2016 FOMC statement," the report said.

But the Fed warned that "economic growth is unlikely to be as robust as in the recent past."

The economy is expected to grow at a 2.1% annual rate in 2018, up from the 2.0% pace seen at the beginning of the year. That's still below the 3% growth the Fed had projected before the election, but it's close enough to the 2.8% pace it had projected in its most recent projections at the end of 2016.

The Fed also projected economic growth of 2.7% in 2019, up from a 2.3% pace seen at the end of last year. That's still below the 3.3% pace it had forecast in its most recent projections, but it's close enough to the 2.8% pace it had projected in its most recent projections at the end of 2016.

The Fed's economic projections have been volatile since the election. In November, the central bank predicted that growth would rise from an annual rate of 2.1% in 2016 to 3.0% by 2019.

But in December, the Fed cut its growth forecast to 2.6% in 2017 and 2.5% in 2018.

Related: Trump wants to slash corporate taxes and eliminate regulations

For President Donald Trump, who has promised to slash corporate taxes and lower regulations, boosting growth is important.

"Looking ahead, we expect the economy to expand 2.3% in 2017, 2.2% in 2018, and 2.0% in 2019," the Fed said.

The Fed also projected that the unemployment rate would rise to 4.4% next year. It had predicted unemployment to rise to 4.5% in 2016, and then to 4.6% by 2019.<|endoftext|>A new poll suggests that Canadians are not expecting the same level of federal spending as the Conservatives promised under the 2015 election campaign.

The poll conducted by the Angus Reid Institute suggests Canadians are looking for a new level of federal spending, but not as much as the Liberal campaign promised in their 2015 election platform.

The poll found that 42 per cent of Canadians say they would like to see a mix of federal spending and a higher level of taxes, while only 19 per cent say they support the current level of federal spending.

This shows that Canadians want to see a mix of spending and taxes, and that the Conservatives' promises of much deeper spending cuts under the 2015 budget were not met with all of the support that they expected, said Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute.

"The Conservatives were looking for a lot more spending cuts, and they said they would be able to make them. But the reality of the situation is, as we've seen, they're not that far away from being able to make those cuts," said Kurl.

Conservatives expected support for spending cuts

Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau campaigned with a pledge to balance the budget in four years.

Trudeau said the Liberals would balance the budget by 2016-2017, meaning federal revenues would have to equal the federal spending.

Trudeau promised to run three straight deficits of more than $10 billion per year to get the country back to balance.

But the federal government projects that it will have a $3.9 billion surplus in 2016-2017, and a $3.5 billion surplus in 2017-2018.

The following chart shows the federal government's projected deficits and surpluses as part of its fiscal projections.

The Crystal Ball: 2.5 weeks ago

Hillary Clinton, who had been thought to have a slight advantage in the race for the Democratic nomination, had a major blowup with Bernie Sanders over the weekend, and her campaign is hitting back hard, claiming that Sanders is the one out of touch with the American people.

Clinton has said that she is the only candidate who can beat Donald Trump, and she has cited her record of success, but Sanders has been saying that he can beat Trump, and in a recent interview, he said that he didn't think Clinton would win the election.

Sanders was asked about the polls that showed him beating Trump in a head-to-head matchup, and he said that he did not think that Sanders could beat Trump, although he was not sure he could win the general election against Trump.

"I don't think I can. I don't know that I can," he said. "But I'm going to do all that I can to try to see that we do win."

Of course, Sanders, like Clinton, has been saying that he is the only candidate who can beat Trump for months, but recent polls have shown Trump beating Clinton in a head-to-head matchup.

The Clinton campaign is going after Sanders, pointing to his "extreme positions" on gun control and campaign finance reform, along with comments he made in which he called black people "super predators."

Clinton's campaign has been going after Sanders on a variety of issues, and they hope that Sanders will continue to attack Clinton in the upcoming primaries in California, New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Dakota.

After all, Clinton has said that Sanders is the "only candidate who can beat Trump."

Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com<|endoftext|>Over a year ago, we started a year-long series called "10 Things I Hate About You."

The goal was to get together 10 things that you hate about your partner, so you could get to know them better and get to know your differences. We had an overwhelming response, with people taking the 10 Things survey countless times and posting them on the Internet. We were surprised at the generosity and honesty of the responses.

We also learned that no matter how good of a person someone is, there are still things they do that annoy you.

Finally, through the process of getting to know our partners, we realized that there are probably 10 things we hate about ourselves. So we're starting a new series called "10 Things I Hate About You."

This time, we're going to focus on things that are personal to us, and things that we don't expect our partner to dislike.

Sometimes people say to me, "I don't care what you do in bed, as long as you're not making me feel uncomfortable."

It's a fair question. But most people don't want to hear, "I don't care about your sex life." So instead of focusing on how you have sex, we're going to focus on how you make us feel.

We're going to focus on things that hurt, and things that make us uncomfortable.

So join me as we take a look at 10 things that make us uncomfortable.

1. You're not the biggest fan of nudity.

We love being nude. We love putting on our clothes, and we love being naked.

We've all been naked at some point, but many people have spent their entire lives not being naked. Some of those people are our partners.

One of the biggest moments we've had was when Matt told us he had to go to the bathroom.

"OK, but I'm going to be naked first," I told him.

"OK, keep your pants on," he responded simply.

It was one of the most intimate moments we've had. We've been together for a long time. We've both been naked a lot. We're both used to being naked in public.

And yet, we had to go to the bathroom together.

Sure, it was embarrassing. But it was also a huge step for us. We've been with him for a while. We've been naked in public together. We don't want to start wearing clothes only for their own sake.

We don't expect you to be a fan of nudity.

2. You don't make us laugh.

I'm not saying you don't make us laugh. You sure do. I find it hard to believe that anyone who says they don't like me and my sense of humor doesn't like my sense of humor.

But you don't.

The government has recently unveiled a new cybercrime strategy to fight it, which says that India is at a "critical stage" of cyber security and is facing "a new wave of cyber threats".

The government has recently unveiled a new cybercrime strategy to fight it, which says that India is at a "critical stage" of cyber security and is facing "a new wave of cyber threats".

In a statement on Thursday, the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) said that the government has taken steps to enhance data sharing with companies and domestic law enforcement agencies for cyber security.

"The government is committed to fighting cybercrime at the national level and is working to strengthen the National Cyber Coordination Centre. This initiative aims to build a strong and resilient cyber security network in place to ensure a strong and safe cyber environment for all Indians," MeitY said in the statement.

Earlier this month, the government had announced a policy, which proposes to introduce a framework for the protection of personal data from cyber-attacks.

The ministry has also directed the National Information Technology Development Agency to work towards reducing the vulnerability of the computer networks of government and private organizations to cyber intrusion and cyber-attacks.

The initiative will focus on strengthening the capabilities of IT infrastructure and IT organisations to prevent cyber-attacks by the country's most vulnerable sectors like the financial sector. The government also intends to work towards the plan to reduce the vulnerability of computer networks to cyber-attacks by encouraging the private sector to share information about cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities.

The cyber security strategy also suggests that the IT industry should be encouraged to enhance its awareness and develop procedures to prevent cyber-attacks.

It also suggests that the government should encourage the private sector to adopt best practices in computer security to prevent cyber-attacks.

The government has also decided to transfer the responsibility of ensuring the security of information technology systems, including the National Broadband Network, to the state governments.<|endoftext|>By: Alex

A/N: This is my first Harry Potter fanfiction. I have read the books and watched the movies so I have a basic idea of what to write about. I will try to be as spoiler free as possible but I'm not going to be subtle. Nothing will be totally out of order, so definitely check back to see what I've written.

For the first chapter, I will be using two different spellings of the term "Harry Potter" so be prepared for that. If you don't like the new spelling, then you can use the other one. I will be using the correct spellings for each chapter and will be using the correct spellings for the names of spells.

Chapter 1: Not a Fluffy Changeling

"Professor Slughorn?"

"Yes, Harry?"

"I'm looking for a book about how to do the Ancient Runes, in the library, but I can't remember where it is."

Slughorn looked at him for a moment. "Dumbledore told me, when you first met him, that you were hoping to learn how to do the Ancient Runes in order to become a new teacher at Hogwarts. So I took you to see him, so you could complete your training, to make sure you didn't screw up your studies again."

Harry nodded. "Okay."

"Now, look." Slughorn held out his hand. "I believe you just asked for a book about Ancient Runes."

Harry looked at him and then took Slughorn's hand, shaking it. "Yeah, that's right."

Slughorn smiled. "Good, now let's get you started on your journey. Get your robes on and come with me."

Harry followed, feeling a little nervous. He could only imagine the reaction Dumbledore would give him if he asked for a book on the Ancient Runes and then broke into the library.

Dumbledore was a very old man, and didn't like to be interrupted. He was very protective of the library and would do anything to keep it safe. The only time he'd let someone in without a Sen Patronus was if they had a good reason.

"All right Harry, I'll show you to your room." Dumbledore said, taking Harry's arm and leading him into the Great Hall.

"The Room of Requirement, right?" Harry asked.

Dumbledore nodded, led him to the door to the Room, and then closed the door behind him.

"You could have just asked to come in the hall, Harry." Dumbledore said.

"I was thinking about it." Harry said. "I don't think I could handle the reaction Dumbledore might have given me, even if he wasn't going to react that way

But one question that's really on everyone's mind: Is the game still worth it? The Xbox One version of Titanfall is a completely different beast than the Xbox 360 and PC versions, after all.

Gears of War 4 isn't a PC game, but, for those who don't play on the PC, it's also not the same game. The Xbox One version of Gears of War 4 has the same resolution, settings, and feel as the PC version. The PC version is also a different beast.

We've already discussed the similarities and differences between the Xbox One and PC versions of Gears of War 4. Let's dig in a little deeper and see what this means for PC gamers.

Is Gears of War 4 on the PC worth it?

Yes and no. Yes, Gears of War 4 is a totally different beast on PC. No, Gears of War 4 is still not worth it if you're a PC gamer.

Gears of War 4 is a PC game

Gears of War 4 is a PC game because it runs on the Unreal Engine 4, which is a custom game engine that's built for PC games. It's the same engine that Unreal Tournament is built on, and it's the same engine that the PC version of Gears of War 3 runs on.

Is this a good thing?

No.

The Unreal Engine 4 is a custom game engine, and it's built for PC games. For anyone who has played a Gears of War game, or a Call of Duty game, this should be a familiar feeling.

It's frustrating to see that the engine that's built for PC games is not used for PC games. If the PC games that Gears of War 4 runs on were developed on PC, it would still be a PC game.

It's totally different

Gears of War 4 is not a PC game in the same way that Gears of War 3 was a PC game. Gears of War 3 made a lot of use of the slower, more detailed Unreal Engine 3, but that's not the case with Gears of War 4.

The Unreal Engine 4 has been tweaked and reworked for Gears of War 4. Some of these changes are subtle, and some people will notice immediately, but the end results are very different.

The PC version of Gears of War 4 features reduced draw distance, and a slimmer field of view. There are also new lighting effects to observe, and the background is much darker. The PC version of Gears of War 4 is also much more colorful than the Xbox One version, with more saturated colors.

It's also set in a different time period, with different environments and art style. The Xbox One version of Gears of War 4 is set in the future, and features the same futuristic setting as Gears of War 3.

The Xbox One version of Gears of War 4 is set in the future, and features the same futuristic setting as Gears of War 3.

There are also some other differences that can't be seen while playing the same game on both platforms. For example, the Xbox One version of Gears of War 4 is exclusive to the Xbox One console, while the PC version is available on all platforms.

It's also a lot less graphically intensive. The PC version of Gears of War 4 is a lot faster than the Xbox One version, and runs at 60fps. The Xbox One version of Gears of War 4 also supports up to 4 players, while the PC version supports up to 8 players.

It's better for co-op

The Xbox One version of Gears of War 4 is set up for co-op, and that's a good thing. The PC version of Gears of War 4 doesn't offer co-op. You're not playing as a character that's controlled by another player, but your character is controlled by the game.

It's not a huge difference, but it's worth noting. The PC version of Gears of War 4 will not let you play with a friend who's playing on the Xbox One.

It's a lot more expensive

The Xbox One version of Gears of War 4 costs $60, while the PC version of Gears of War 4 costs $80. The difference is that the PC version of Gears of War 4 costs more money. The Xbox One version will ship with a free copy of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, which includes all of the DLC content for the Xbox One version of Gears of War 4.

The PC version of Gears of War 4 will only come with the base game. Additionally, the Xbox One version of Gears of War 4 will only ship with the Ultimate Edition.

It's also not a lot of fun

The Xbox One version of Gears of War 4 features a lot of more intense gameplay. The Xbox One version features the same game modes, but the Xbox One version also has a lot more content.

For those of you who have been reading my blog for a while, or have a family member or loved one who has been diagnosed with depression, I would like to ask you to consider the following: How many of us have been in that situation?

How many of us have thought "I wish I had the courage to tell them" or "I wish they would know how much I was hurting before I got to the hospital"?

How many of us have been in the hospital, in the psych ward, because we thought that we were "crazy" or "bad"?

It's the subject of countless memes, a meme that's been making the rounds since the end of the first presidential debate.

But now, President Barack Obama's recent remarks on the 2008 financial crisis have some believing that he could be on to something.

"I think there are some consequences to what happened that are difficult to untangle," Obama said during the debate. "And I think the economy has to get back on track."

Obama wasn't the only one to make the comment. Republican candidate Mitt Romney, who's been criticized for his record on economic issues, also said: "The president took a hit for it, but I think that the overall economy is doing reasonably well."

However, many economists say that the economy is in "recovery" mode, with slow growth and low unemployment, and that the "gains" from the recession are starting to ebb away.

Not everyone agrees with this assessment.

"There is no recovery," said Robert Reich, a former secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton. "The economy is in a recession. The only thing that is growing is the federal debt."

Reich was an economic adviser to Obama's presidential campaign.

Reich has been skeptical of the Obama administration's ability to turn around the economy.

"It's going to take a lot more than a speech. It's going to take a lot more than the "you didn't build that" speech," Reich said in an interview with CNNMoney.

The Obama campaign did not respond to a request for comment.<|endoftext|>Imagine that you're a child. You're drawn to a cute little creature with wicked red eyes and a singed, mohawk. You want more than anything to be just like him.

You pick him up and stare at him, mesmerized. All you want to do is run and climb trees, play ninja and eat candy. You want to be just like him, to be evil, to be sad, to be angry, to be good.

But he's not your enemy. He won't harm you, probably — he's just a toy. He's not evil. He's a toy, some random little creature you picked up that doesn't say anything.

But he's not your enemy. He won't harm you, probably — he's just a toy. He's not evil. He's a toy, some random little creature you picked up that doesn't say anything.

What kind of a person would you become if you are given a toy of your very own?

There is no real answer to that question, but we can make one up: You'd be a nice person. You'd be kind. You'd be open-minded and curious. You'd be forgiving. You'd be patient. You'd be kind. You'd be patient. You'd be forgiving.

You'd be kind.

A few months ago, I wrote an article on why kindness is so important to Australia. The idea came from a conversation I had with my girlfriend, a lovely woman named Elizabeth, who made the comment that kindness is so important to her because it makes you more open-minded. Elizabeth was right. I've had the experience of living in a world that's very closed-minded, to the point where I questioned whether or not I existed, only to be taken in by people who were as self-absorbed and insular as I am. I realized that there is no such thing as a species that truly lives in the open-minded, open-hearted state. We all have a tendency to be closed-minded or closed-hearted.

I also realized that kindness is not just something you can teach as a lesson in the classroom. You can learn kindness by watching the people around you. You can learn kindness by observing people you don't know, and by contemplating the world around you. You can learn kindness by seeing the world in a new way, through a different lens. You can learn kindness by engaging in conversations with people you don't know, and by observing people you don't know, and by contemplating the world around you.

But the point of this article isn't to teach you how to be a nice person. You already know how to be a nice person. You already know how to be kind.

The point of this article is to show you how to experience kindness.

It's not hard to teach kindness. It's not hard to observe kindness. It's not hard to become kinder. It's difficult to learn kindness.

But it's easy to be kind.

Kindness is easy.

Kindness is easy.

The mother of a teacher killed by a student at a school in the US state of California has been found not guilty of manslaughter.

The verdict was read after a four-day trial in the US state of San Diego.

A jury had found 21-year-old Tamara Dominguez not guilty of the murder of 17-year-old Jaylen Fryberg, also a teacher at Palomar High School.

Dominguez had been accused of shooting Fryberg in the head after the two argued over a pair of headphones.

Dominguez and Fryberg were teaching a maths exam at the school on 3 June 2015.

Both had been sitting in a nearby classroom when they heard the first gun shot.

Dominguez told police she had confronted Fryberg after she found the headphones in his bag.

The two argued about them, and then the teacher shot Fryberg, who was lying near a set of lockers.

He died in hospital a few days later.

Dominguez told police she had been scared, but "didn't mean to kill him", according to the Los Angeles Times.

The school district has since moved to ban the sale of headphones to students, but the ban was not immediately enforced.

The trial had centred on whether Dominguez had a reasonable fear of Fryberg's life when she opened fire.

The pair had argued over a pair of headphones after the latter had found them in Fryberg's backpack.

Prosecutors argued that Dominguez was in a stressful situation at the time of the shooting and had no choice but to shoot Fryberg.<|endoftext|>The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is a non-profit membership organization for the development of open source software, including but not limited to the Linux operating system.

The Collider's world premiere of the first season of the Netflix series Sense8 is coming up on the weekend, and the show's cast and crew are giving fans a sneak peek at the show's new characters.

Netflix announced the show's new members at its San Diego Comic-Con panel, including Danny Pudi, Jodie Foster, Tuppence Middleton, Naveen Andrews, Miguel Ángel Silvestre, Andy Samberg, Doona Bae, Andy Schur, Doona Bae, Freema Agyeman, Jamie Clayton, Max Riemelt, Tuppence Middleton, and Aml Ameen.

"You know, this is the first thing I've ever done that's been written by an African-American woman," Pudi said. "I can't tell you how great it is."

Pudi also talked about the show's themes of race and gender in the arts. "The show is about people who have experiences that are not so different from their neighbors," he said. "And yet we're not allowed to talk about it, and we're not allowed to be who we are. Sexism and racism and homophobia and transphobia. We don't have a voice—that's the thing I'm trying to bring out and say."

Meanwhile, the cast also revealed that the show's alternate universe setting is inspired by the work of Marc Okrand, who was a black American writer who was also a mentor to Shirley Jackson. The network also revealed that it's working with the author on a book of short stories that will be a companion piece to the show.

The cast also talked about the show's sensibility and themes. "It's about the importance of connection, and maybe the importance of your body and your spirit," Foster said. "How do you try to live in a world that's not as connected as you would like to be, [and] how do you go about making that happen? In a very, very literal way."

At one point, Foster confessed that she was "crying" during a scene with Jodie Foster. "I cried during the scene, because it's about these people, and it's about a woman and a man who are so connected, so soulful, and so in tune with each other, and yet it's also about their passion and their connection and the connection that they have with each other," she said.

Foster also said the show took some inspiration from her own life. "I think it's really important to get behind the camera and be the storyteller," she said. "To be the person who says the things that we want to say, and to be the person who gets it across. And that's what's interesting to me."

As for the first season, Pudi said, "I think it's going to be a different kind of experience that people will have, and it's going to be a different kind of storytelling."<|endoftext|>Troy Mullins, a former senior official in President Barack Obama's administration, is set to be the next U.S. ambassador to Ireland. Mullins will serve as the U.S. ambassador to Ireland until the Senate confirms President Donald Trump's nominee for the position, former Rep. Tom Price.

Mullins, who served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, will be the first former Obama administration official to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Ireland. He has served in the private sector for most of his career, including at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. Mullins has also worked for the U.S. Agency for International Development, the State Department, and the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Mullins has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration. He has criticized the administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, and he worked to undermine the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.

Mullins, who is also a member of the Catholic Church, has been a vocal supporter of the Democratic Party, and he has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration.

"In the first week of his administration, President Trump has initiated a series of executive orders that have undermined the foundation of our national security, the very foundation of our country, and the very foundation of the United States," Mullins said during an interview with the Irish National Broadcasting Corporation last week.

"I'm very concerned about what the Trump administration is doing, and I want to make sure that our foreign policy reflects the best of American values."

Mullins' appointment came after Ireland's foreign minister, Charlie Flanagan, met with Trump officials in Washington, D.C. on Monday, Feb. 20. Flanagan has been a vocal critic of the president's policy toward Ireland and has criticized the terms of the U.S.-Ireland trade

The U.S. military's most powerful and defensive fighter jet, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, is a grave threat to the United States' national security, according to a newly declassified report.

The report by the Defense Science Board, an independent, nonpartisan arm of the Pentagon, warns that the F-35 could be "inherently dangerous to the national security of the United States."

The report, released Tuesday, calls the F-35 a "burden on the U.S. economy" and says the Pentagon should abandon plans to buy as many as 2,443 of the planes over the next 15 years.

The report says that the Pentagon should instead invest in more stealthy fighter aircraft, such as the F-22 Raptor.

"The F-35 is inherently dangerous to the national security of the United States, and should be cancelled," the report said. "The F-35 is an incomplete aircraft, severely lacking in many key areas, and is so expensive that it is the most expensive weapons system in history."

The report, written by a panel of 13 retired military officers, comes as the Pentagon tries to take a step back from an expensive and costly weapons program that has generated huge controversy and criticism over its cost and capabilities.

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program, and the last of the nation's three major fighter jet programs. It's also the most complex, and at $379.5 billion, it is the most costly weapons program in history.

The Pentagon is struggling to come up with a plan to replace the aging F-16 and the aging F-15 fighters that fly with the Air Force. The F-35 is meant to do the job of both planes — a fleet of up to 2,443 fighters would cost about $1 trillion over the next 15 years. The F-35 program has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and a U.S. Air Force test pilot was killed in January by a faulty F-35.

The jet was designed with a "stealth" capability that makes it hard to see, but also makes it easy for enemy pilots to shoot down. The F-35 is designed to be able to penetrate enemy air defenses, even cruise missiles and enemy aircraft.

The report said the F-35's stealth capability is being undermined by a lack of skilled pilots and maintenance workers.

The report said the F-35 was too complicated and difficult to maintain.

"The F-35's development has been plagued by serious design flaws, and the production and sustainment program has been plagued by cost overruns and technical problems," the report said.

The report said the F-35's radar and electronic warfare upgrades have not been tested properly, and the jet's computer systems and avionics have been slow to adapt to new software.

"The F-35's complex, high-tech system of sensors and computers that drive its combat system is not mature and cannot be relied on," the report said.

The report said the Air Force was only just beginning to develop and test its own aircraft to replace the F-16 and the F-15.

"The F-35 program has been plagued by problems that have escalated over time, and the program is not currently on a path to replace the F-16 and F-15," the report said.

"The F-35's stealth capabilities have not been tested properly, and it has been demonstrated that the jet will be detectable by enemy radar if it is flying at low altitudes, or on cloudy days," the report said. "The F-35 has not been tested to the extent necessary to guarantee its ability to detect and defeat enemy air defenses."

The F-35 is flown by pilots who are considered too young and inexperienced to fly the Navy's F/A-18 Super Hornet.

The report said the F-35 is too expensive and too complex to be fielded on a timely basis.

"The F-35's development has been plagued by serious design flaws, and the program is not currently on a path to replace the F-16 and F-15," the report said. "The F-35's complex, high-tech system of sensors and computers that drive its combat system is not mature and cannot be relied on."

Even if you're a mobile 3D printer user, there are times when you'll need to print something large or small.

Enter the Stereo Sculpting Machine, an open source project created by a team of engineers at the University of Michigan, which creates 3D models out of sound waves.

The Stereo Sculpting Machine uses an acoustic resonator to create 3D models out of sound waves. The Stereo Sculpting Machine uses an acoustic resonator to create 3D models out of sound waves.

According to the project's website, it works by creating a series of resonating diaphragms, or shells, and then placing the side of the "shell" against a sound source (in this case, an acoustic resonator). The Sound Source (a speaker) is placed on the other side of the resonator, and sound waves from the speaker travel through the shell and hit the Sound Source, which causes the sound waves inside the shell to vibrate, creating a 3D model.

The Sound Source (a speaker) is placed on the other side of the resonator, and sound waves from the speaker travel through the shell and hit the Sound Source, which causes the sound waves inside the shell to vibrate, creating a 3D model.

The results are impressive -- sounds like a helicopter, a cell phone, and a guitar can be seen from any direction. The site also notes that the Stereo Sculpting Machine can be used to create stunningly realistic models of all sorts of objects.

This isn't the first project to use 3D printing in this way. Last year, an artist in Italy created a 3D-printed version of the Dali Lama, which is currently on display at the Museo del Prado in Madrid.

"I'm glad to be back," said Gasol, who played 13 minutes, scoring four points, at Charlotte. "I'm excited to be back on the court."

But the Lakers' coach was not looking forward to the extended absence for the forward who had been playing a key role in the team's championship run last season.

"I'm not a guy who wants to be a spectator," Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni said. "I want to be involved in the game. I don't like to be a spectator. But we're not going to be able to play the games. You have to respect that."

Gasol will undergo surgery on Monday in Philadelphia and could be sidelined for up to six months.

He will be the latest in a long line of injured Lakers players who have missed a significant amount of time.

The Lakers will play their first nine games without Gasol, who has had back surgery in the past. He had 11 points, seven rebounds and four assists in 20 minutes against the Hornets.

This is the game that started it all. In Zombicide, players take it in turns to generate a zombie horde from a specific location. The game's rules are designed mainly for a single player, but the zombie horde generation rules are easily modified to fit up to four players. The rules are simple, but they provide just enough complexity to keep things interesting.

The game is fairly easy to learn, but it's a little more complicated to play. The rules are clearly laid out but the game can get confusing if you're not careful.

The game's theme is based on the Zombocalypse movie franchise, which features a zombie apocalypse. The Zombocalypse movies take the basic concept of the original Zombicide game and adapt it for a more modern setting.

Zombicide was originally published in 2000 by John Wick Presents, and later re-released in 2004.

I liked the plan for creating the zombie horde, but I failed in my attempt to make it use as much of my available resources as possible.

I have a simple question, how many times have you been on a plane and left your iPhone in the overhead bin? I have had it for a few years now and I always find myself doing it, however it's now been a few months since I took it out of the bin.

The campaign was announced by the Church's press service on Tuesday, claiming that it would make the church's "image more attractive" to young people.

"The Church wants to encourage young people to find God," the statement said, adding that it planned to run the campaign "in a very public way," namely "in all the regions of Russia."

The Church's press service described the campaign as a "long-term project" that would make "the church's image more attractive" to young people by "celebrating family values."

"Young people are not just interested in the Church's religious teachings, but also in the fact that families are a concrete example of the Christian values, and a family without children is a family without faith," the church said.

The Church's campaign follows a recent spate of anti-LGBT legislation in Russia, which has seen a series of rulings by the country's highest court, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, banning the distribution of materials that promote homosexuality and "gay propaganda."

The Russian Orthodox Church has also come under serious criticism for its refusal to accept LGBT people into its ranks, with some members reportedly staging gay pride parades in protest.

The Church has also been criticized for its portrayal of the LGBT community in its media, with advertisements for "gay relief" that have been branded as "homophobic" and "hate-filled."

The Russian Orthodox Church has previously announced its plans to open a new youth center focused on "curing homosexuality" in the northern city of Sochi.<|endoftext|>A new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows Michigan has the highest rate of diabetes in the country, making it one of the top 10 states with the highest rate of adult-onset diabetes.

According to the CDC, the state's adult-onset diabetes rate is 1.9 percent, higher than all but four other states. It's also more than four times the national average of 0.5 percent.

Overall, the CDC found that over a third of adults in the U.S. have diabetes, with an estimated 39.4 million people with the disease.

Related: 10 States with the Highest Obesity Rates

"The number of Americans with diabetes is expected to nearly double by 2030," CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a statement. "This increase will require greater commitment from health care providers, as well as increased community and family education to prevent and treat diabetes."

Like many other states, Michigan has an elevated rate of obesity, with one in four adults in the state classified as obese. There's also a disproportionate number of adults with diabetes, with nearly one in five adults with diabetes.

Other states with high rates of adult-onset diabetes include Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas.

Related: 10 States with the Highest Childhood Obesity Rates

The cost of treating diabetes is a major factor in the high rates of diabetes, the CDC said.

"Diabetes is a leading cause of disability in the United States, with nearly $147 billion spent on treatment each year," Frieden said. "This cost burden is especially high in rural areas and among racial and ethnic minorities."

The CDC said that the cost of treating diabetes is $1.8 billion in 2010, and that the costs could increase to $2.2 billion by 2025.

"The high cost of diabetes is a key reason why many people with diabetes go without needed treatment, or take unnecessary risks with their health," Frieden said. "We must continue our efforts to cut the number of people with diabetes, and reduce the burden of diabetes."

A disturbing video has emerged online showing a group of masked men harassing a Muslim woman in a UK city.

The video, which was shot in Birmingham, shows the men shouting "terrorist" and "this is for Syria" before dragging the woman back into their van.

In another video, the woman tells the men that they are "terrorists" before they begin to kick her.

The attack, which was filmed by a passerby, is the latest in a series of violent attacks targeting Muslims in the UK.

Since the Paris attacks in November, there have been hundreds of incidents of abuse against Muslims by youths.

The latest incident comes after a group of men were filmed harassing a Muslim woman in North London.

In a video uploaded to YouTube, a group of masked men were seen shouting: "This is for Syria, you terrorist, you Muslim! This is for Syria, you terrorist you Muslim."

After dragging the woman back into their van, the group continued by shouting "This is for Syria, this is for Syria, this is for Syria."

In another video, the woman is seen telling the men that they are "terrorists" before they begin to kick her.

Another clip shows a man telling the woman, "We will fight you, we will fight you, we will fight you, you Muslim, you Muslim" before kicking her.

The video was posted by a passerby who was driving past the scene.

A spokesperson for the city's police force, which is investigating the incident, said: "Police were called to reports of a car being driven at a person in North Street, Birmingham at around 3.30pm.

"The victim, a woman in her 30s, was treated at the scene by paramedics for her injuries.

"The incident was not being treated as a terrorist incident.

"Police are making enquiries to establish if any offences have been committed."

In a separate incident, a woman has told the Birmingham Mail that she was called a "terrorist" by a group of men after she was attacked by an unknown assailant in Birmingham.

The woman, who has not been named, said: "All I remember is a guy in a black suit, he had a grey hoodie, and he got into my face.

"I was shocked, I didn't know what was going on.

"I was asking him who he was and why he had called me a terrorist, and he just told me to shut up.

"I was really scared, so I said to him: 'What did you call me?'

"He then said: 'It's for Syria, it's for Syria' and then he kicked me in the neck."

The incident happened at about 3.30pm on Tuesday, April 5.

The woman added: "I was in my car, I was in my own car, I was a few paces away from my house.

"I had just put my kids to bed. I got a call from my son's school telling me what had happened.

"I asked my son what had happened and he said everything was fine. I was just in shock.

"I have never experienced anything like that before."

The woman said she was attacked while waiting for a bus in the city centre.

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: "Police in Birmingham are investigating an alleged racially aggravated incident where a woman was the victim of a racially aggravated assault.

"Officers have arrived on the scene and enquiries are ongoing.

"Investigations are ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact officers on 101."

A spokesperson for the city's police force said: "Police were called to reports of a car being driven at a person in North Street, Birmingham at around 3.30pm.

If you're like me, you've spent the last few months trying to find the most effective way to manage your everyday tasks. Whether it's a new set of to-dos, a new project, or a new task, it can be hard to know where to start or where to end. With so many options, it can get overwhelming. So, we're here to help. Here are some tools that we use frequently to manage our lives.

1. Google Calendar

A few years ago, I was trying to use Google Calendar to manage my to-dos, but it wasn't doing what I needed it to do. So, I spent a lot of time trying different ways to integrate it into my workflow. And here are some of the biggest issues I encountered:

I had a lot of to-dos that I didn't need to be reminded of (like checking Gmail).

I couldn't see the duration of each to-do.

I couldn't see the next due time for each to-do.

I couldn't add a due date for each to-do.

I couldn't add reminders for each to-do.

I couldn't see the status of each to-do.

I almost always missed a due date.

I couldn't create reminders.

I had a lot of tasks and meetings that I didn't need reminders for.

I had to search for the calendar entry in Google Calendar for each task or meeting.

2. Asana

I've been using Asana for about a year, and I absolutely love it. It's a task management platform that is pretty simple and elegant. I've found that Asana is my go-to app when I need to manage my to-dos. Use Asana to schedule your to-dos, check in on your to-dos, and set reminders for your to-dos. You can also add a project manager to the app and then use Asana to manage your task lists. Asana also allows you to add a reminder to each of your tasks every day.

3. Trello

Talk about a simple app. I've been using Trello to manage my to-dos for almost two years now. Trello is simple. It's powerful. And it can handle just about any task management task.

4. Google Keep

Google Keep has been around for a long time. It's simple to use, and it has the ability to send you reminders. It also has a whole bunch of features like Google Calendar integrations. Use Google Keep to get all of your work done.

5. Yodlee

I've been using Yodlee for about a month now. It's a task management app with a lot of great features, including the ability to create a to-do list and text-only reminders. It's a great way to get your daily tasks done.

6. Aha!

Aha! is a very simple task management app that allows you to set a to-do and mark it as complete. When you start to complete the to-do, the app asks you to add a comment. You can add as many comments as you want. When you set a task, you can add a comment to it. When you finish a task, you can add a comment to it. When you set a to-do and you're done with it, you can add a comment. You can also mark a to-do as complete with a check mark.

7. Todoist

Todoist is a task management app that is very simple to use. We use it to manage our to-do list and our project management.

8. To-Doist

Todoist is a task management app that is very simple to use. We use it to manage our to-do list and our project management.

9. Todoist — Upgrade

Todoist has recently acquired a series of tools, including a drag-and-drop task editor. These tools allow you to create tasks, move tasks around, create tasks using a variety of templates, add comments to a task, and more.

10. Wunderlist

Wunderlist has been around for a while, but still has a lot of features that we haven't used. For example, I really like the ability to make a to-do list by adding a note to it. Plus, there's a task tool that lets you add a task and have it automatically update as you complete it.

11. Moment

Moment is a task management app that's really simple to use. This is one of the best options for managing your to-do list.

12. Todoist — Upgrade

Todoist has recently acquired a series of tools, including a drag-and-drop task editor. These tools allow you

Riot police stand guard after a protester threw a Molotov cocktail at officers during a protest against police violence against African-Americans in the wake of the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Mo. on Saturday. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)

The New York Times editorial board has a message for the police: "Stop shooting people."

The newspaper's call for action comes in response to the police shooting death of Michael Brown, who was shot and killed by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer on Saturday. "No matter how many times the police are proven to have acted with excessive force, they must be held accountable when they shoot someone," the Times writes. "There is no excuse for that."

The editorial was prompted by the death of Oscar Grant, an unarmed black man shot by a BART police officer in Oakland, Calif., in 2009. The city, under pressure from the American Civil Liberties Union, reached a $5.9 million settlement with the family of Grant, who died in the back of a police car.

The Times editorial board said that Grant's shooting "is an especially stark reminder of the need for new training and audits of police training, in particular, as well as more effective community policing."

The Board of Correction, an independent agency that oversees the New York City Police Department, has yet to release the findings of its internal investigation into the shooting.<|endoftext|>Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF

The mirror is being erected in front of the Shanghai World Financial Center, which is currently under construction. It will be used to showcase art and stop people from using mobile phones in the area.

"What we need to do is to get every American to talk about this and to understand the importance of having a full and transparent congressional investigation," Clinton said Tuesday night at a rally in New Hampshire.

The challenge, which comes after Clinton's recent comments about the deaths of four Americans during a 2012 terror attack in Libya, is a new sign that the Democratic front-runner is trying to widen her base of support as her run for the presidency enters the homestretch.

The lack of interest in Benghazi among Democrats is not surprising, given Clinton's tenure as the US secretary of state and her decision to leave the US mission there before it was fully secured, according to a report by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.

As a result, the State Department did not immediately submit a plan to protect the facility, and the deaths of four Americans occurred during a chaotic period in which the American ambassador and other officials were in a battle with the terror group al Qaeda.

Clinton has said she was "heartbroken" about the deaths of US Ambassador Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith and Tyrone Woods, and that the attack occurred at a moment when the US administration was trying to save lives. But she has stopped short of blaming the attack on a protest against an anti-Islamic video.

Her remarks Tuesday were different.

"We need to learn the truth and the American people deserve to know the truth," she said. "So I'm going to call for a full, independent investigation, not just into what happened in Libya, but into the broader threats that we face both here at home and around the world."

Clinton was a top surrogate for her husband, former President Bill Clinton, during his 1996 reelection campaign and has kept an active role in his administration, serving as his national security adviser.

In an interview with CNN's "At This Hour" on Wednesday, the former secretary of state said that she believed the Benghazi attacks were a result of the terrorist group al Qaeda's plans to carry out "very large-scale attacks."

"It wasn't just a protest," she said. "It was a pre-planned attack. It was al Qaeda trying to kill Americans."

Clinton also called for a "full and complete" investigation into the circumstances that led to the deaths of Americans in Benghazi.

"I am not going to point fingers," Clinton said. "But we need to know what happened, why it happened, what do we do to prevent it from happening again."

This week, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., traveled to New York City to deliver a speech before the National Organization for Marriage's annual convention.

He made it clear that there was no daylight between himself and NOM on the issue of marriage. Instead, he urged the organization's members to fight for a redefinition of marriage.

"To those who would deny our full equality under the law, I say, 'Get out of the way. Marriage has been defined before in law and by the court, and I'm proud to stand with those who have fought for full equality for all Americans,'" McCain said.

"I am proud of my friends at the office of the Senate Ethics Committee who investigated NOM and found nothing unlawful," he added.

The NOM event, which was held on the eve of the Supreme Court's landmark decision on same-sex marriage, was attended by an estimated 800 people.

McCain has a long history of supporting traditional marriage, but he has also done plenty of damage to his reputation as a war hero by defending a group that is a group for people who oppose marriage equality.

In 2011, he was one of the primary sponsors of a bill in the Senate that would have banned the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage. He later apologized for his support of that bill, which would have codified discrimination against LGBT people.

He also backed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.

Despite his earlier attempts to distance himself from the group, McCain has proven himself to be a staunch supporter of NOM, which was founded in 2007 by Maggie Gallagher, a co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage.

Gallagher has called for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, and she was also the co-chair of the group's recent super PAC.

In an interview with ThinkProgress, Gallagher said that it was "disgusting" that the senator would travel to New York City to speak at a NOM event.

"What is amazing about John McCain is that he has not only shown total support for the organization that he has worked with for decades, but he has also been a major funder of the organization that was founded by a man who has called on Congress to outlaw marriage between any two people, and now he is introducing a senator to speak at an event that is devoted to this kind of hatred and that kind of discrimination," she said.

Gallagher also said that McCain's visit to New York was "a mockery of the people of New York and the people of New York State."

She called on McCain to resign from his position on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which he currently serves.

"I have no idea why he would do this, but I think that given the fact that he is a proud supporter of marriage equality by any definition — including the definition he himself held for decades — he should resign from the Senate Armed Services Committee," she said.

Gallagher also said that he should be expelled from the Senate.

"I think he should be expelled from the Senate because he's demonstrated that he is not fit to be part of our body."

The NOM convention is not the first time McCain has been associated with anti-LGBT groups.

In 2009, he led a failed campaign that tried to stop the president from making a statement that would allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military.

In 2012, McCain co-sponsored a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.

The Islamic State uses graphic imagery in its propaganda videos, and the U.S. government is trying to shine a light on the group's use of sophisticated technology to continue its message.

The United States has condemned the Islamic State's use of propaganda online, and the Pentagon has said that the group has created its own digital persona. But the Islamic State's use of images and videos in its online videos, as well as the group's use of social media to recruit, has evolved into an increasingly complex issue.

"They're using more sophisticated communications tools as well as more sophisticated media techniques," Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said. "We're trying to figure out how they're doing that and what the ramifications are for us."

The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has come under increased scrutiny in recent months. The group has lost its grip on parts of Iraq and Syria, and several U.S. officials have complained about the group's use of social media to recruit Westerners.

The Pentagon has denied that it is concerned with the Islamic State's use of social media, saying that it is focusing on other extremist organizations, such as al-Qaida. The U.S. government is also trying to determine how the Islamic State uses

In a first-of-its-kind lawsuit, a group of women are accusing Donald Trump of sexual assault, using allegations from a woman who said he forcibly kissed her and groped her when she was 13 years old.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court, accuses Mr. Trump of raping the woman in 1994, the same year he married Melania Trump.

The man who filed the suit, journalist Timothy O'Brien, said the woman, named as "Katie Johnson," decided to come forward with her claims after watching Mr. Trump's presidential campaign.

"If he had a lawyer, he would have litigated this case years ago," Mr. O'Brien said in a telephone interview. "I think that after the last debate, he realized that he was going to have to take some legal action. I think he realized that he was going to have to deal with the public getting to know his wife, and the fact that she wore a short dress."

The lawsuit was filed on Monday by two women who say they were on a trip to New York City with Mr. Trump and Mr. Johnson in 1994. Ms. Johnson, who now goes by Katie, told The New York Times that Mr. Trump groped her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt.

Afterward, the Times reported, Mr. Trump grabbed her hand and steered her toward an elevator.

"Mr. Trump, who was also on the elevator, told her that he liked her and that he would be her husband," the report said.

The lawsuit says Mr. Trump groped Ms. Johnson on five separate occasions between 1994 and a trip to Mar-a-Lago in 1997.

Mr. O'Brien said the lawsuit is the first legal action against Mr. Trump alleging sexual assault by a man who has been a member of Mr. Trump's family.

"I think that women who speak out, especially when they know that they have a husband who is a prominent public figure, are going to be scrutinized a lot more than they would be in other circumstances," he said.

Mr. Trump, via a lawyer, has disputed the allegations.

Mr. O'Brien said the lawsuit will be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which makes it a crime to join or assist in an organization that engages in serious criminal activity.

In a statement, Mr. Trump said he was "not aware" of the lawsuit and that any claim "without merit" would be rejected.

"It is time for the Clintons to settle this terrible incident," he said.

On Thursday, the U.S. Senate passed a $788 billion defense bill.

The bill ends two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, increases defense spending and reduces the deficit.

The State of the Union address is less than a week away, and President Obama is expected to lay out his vision for fiscal policy in the coming months.

Ahead of the speech, we take a look at the big deals in the bill, and what it means for Americans.

The bill's biggest winners

The National Defense Authorization Act passed the Senate in a 98-2 vote, despite efforts by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to amend the bill to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.

More than half of the $3.4 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funding goes to the war in Afghanistan.

The bill also includes $500 million in funding for intelligence and surveillance programs, and $50 million in funding for Afghanistan-Pakistan border security.

The bill also includes $200 million for missile defense programs, and $50 million for missile defense programs in Europe.

The bill also increases the number of service members in the National Guard by about 10,000, and increases funding for National Guard personnel by $8.7 billion.

The Bitcoin community has rallied around the cause of the hard fork, but it doesn't have to be this way. The community has the power to control the direction of the project, but it lacks the courage to exercise that power.

With the Bitcoin community split into two camps — the Bitcoin Core and the Bitcoin Unlimited — the outcome of the fork will likely determine the fate of the entire cryptocurrency.

This is what the tension looks like.

It doesn't have to be this way.

The Bitcoin community has a powerful voice in the development of the wallet software, and it can speak out against any proposed changes.

But its voice has been muted.

There's a reason for that.

Bitcoin Unlimited takes the first step toward a future where Bitcoin is a decentralized payment network. It is a clear path toward a truly decentralized currency — one where the value of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies is directly linked to how many people use them.

If Bitcoin Unlimited is adopted, the interests of the existing community will be reflected in the development of the software.

Bitcoin Unlimited maintains a reputation for transparency and usability. The software allows users to verify the validity of transactions and sends the transaction history back to a previous point in time.

The Bitcoin Core software is more centralized and centralized, and it is hard to use.

It is difficult to use because users are forced to download a software package that changes the Bitcoin client software every time they install it. This means that the developers are able to change the client at their leisure, and this makes the Bitcoin Core software less useful to users.

It's also difficult to use because the Bitcoin Core software is not transparent.

Because of the way the software works, the Bitcoin Core software is not the most convenient way to use Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Core is the root of Bitcoin's problems. It is a poorly designed system that is riddled with bugs and is prone to security issues.

Bitcoin Unlimited looks like a better alternative.

This is why the decision to include Bitcoin Unlimited is so important.

The Bitcoin Unlimited project is a sign of the Bitcoin community's willingness to grow. It shows that the Bitcoin community is willing to grow, and it shows that the Bitcoin community wants to protect its decentralization.

It is a sign that the Bitcoin community is not going away.

Bitcoin Unlimited is not a new cryptocurrency. It is a fork of Bitcoin Core.

This means that Bitcoin Unlimited is not just another altcoin. It is a fork of Bitcoin Core.

The only way to effectively adopt Bitcoin Unlimited is if the Bitcoin community chooses to do so.

That's why the Bitcoin Unlimited fork will be one of the most important developments in the history of the cryptocurrency. It will be something that will be remembered for a long time.

One of the most important parts of the Bitcoin community is taking responsibility for its future.

If the Bitcoin Core community doesn't choose to adopt Bitcoin Unlimited, then the entire Bitcoin community will lose its ability to govern itself.

The Bitcoin community is something that is very difficult to change. The slow and uncertain change that Bitcoin is going through is a testament to that.

But the Bitcoin community has the power to change itself. It can give the Bitcoin Core software a push to become more transparent. It can make the Bitcoin Core client more user-friendly.

The Bitcoin community has a voice. The Bitcoin community has the power.

The Bitcoin community still has a lot of work to do, but if the Bitcoin community chooses to adopt Bitcoin Unlimited, then the future of Bitcoin will be more secure and more flexible.

If the Bitcoin community ignores the Bitcoin Unlimited fork, then Bitcoin will become even more centralized.

The Bitcoin community has the power to make its future more secure and more flexible.

The Bitcoin community has the power to make its future more secure and more flexible.

At the beginning of this month, the other lawyers' committee convened for its first meeting. It was a rare opportunity to discuss the ethics of the profession in a room full of people who work in the field.

The meeting occurred during the height of the Supreme Court's ongoing debate over its "Citizens United" decision, which had bars discussion. The Committee on Professional Responsibility was created to "encourage and protect the integrity of the legal profession, to encourage the extension of ethics education and to prevent and respond to unethical behavior."

The group consists of representatives of a number of professional organizations, including the American Bar Association, the National Law Journal, the New York State Bar Association and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. It also includes a handful of attorneys who have been at the forefront of this debate, including Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz.

Dershowitz walked the committee through some of the consequences of the ruling. "It will change the whole framework of the criminal justice system, including the rules of evidence, the rules of grand jury procedure," he said.

The committee also discussed the impact it could have on the legal profession as a whole, and the committee's message for the future. According to the committee, the Supreme Court decision "signals that our system of justice is now open to corruption and that lawyers who try to advance their careers through the political process will be subject to prosecution."

The committee members also discussed the need for a new ethics code in the future. The code, which the committee didn't release, would protect lawyers from being accused of unethical behavior. It would also require lawyers to disclose their financial and professional relationships with outside entities.

The committee's recommendations, which are still being discussed, are due to the Supreme Court by Oct. 20.

The Supreme Court is weighing a number of cases that have been brought up by the other lawyers' committee — including a case involving an attorney who was investigating a client who had been hospitalized after driving under the influence. The attorney represented the client, who was later sued by the hospital over the incident.

The case, the Campaign Finance Integrity Act of 2005, has already been ruled on by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The case is currently pending before the Supreme Court.<|endoftext|>It's a sad day for the world of shaving, but this is a great day for it.

The United Nations on Tuesday called for war crimes against the Syrian regime to be investigated and the world body to work towards an end to the violence.

In a strongly worded appeal, the U.N. special panel of inquiry on Syria said it had collected "credible evidence" that President Bashar Assad's forces had committed war crimes.

"Those responsible for war crimes must be held accountable," the U.N. Security Council was told.

"The international community must take all necessary measures to protect civilians and uphold international humanitarian law," it said.

The panel, which has been investigating the deadly Syria conflict since April, said it had collected accounts from more than 70 witnesses about the use of chemical weapons and dozens of videos.

The panel, headed by Paulo Pinheiro, said it had confirmed the use of the toxic agent sarin as a weapon against civilians in the city of Khan al-Assal on April 4.

It said it would not go into the details of the attack, but said the evidence gathered by the panel suggested that government forces deployed the chemical and that the attack was likely carried out by the military.

"The panel can confirm that sarin was used in Khan al-Assal on 4 April," the report said. It said the attack killed between 100 and 150 people.

The panel also said it had received evidence that the Syrian government had used chlorine in the town of Madaya to attack civilians and destroy medical facilities.

Pinheiro said he had been stunned by the scale of the suffering caused by the war in Syria and said he was "profoundly concerned" by the "continued use of chemical weapons by any party in Syria."

He said his report would be shared with the U.N. Security Council, the U.N. General Assembly and the International Criminal Court (ICC).

The U.N. Security Council has condemned the use of chemical weapons, but has deferred responsibility in the dispute to the U.N. Human Rights Council.

Syria, which has blamed rebels for using chemical weapons, has said it would join the ICC if the Security Council adopts a resolution putting it on trial.

The U.S. and its allies have threatened to veto such a move, but Russia and China have said they will back the council's referral.

The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says that if the Security Council gets the referral, it would be a significant step towards the ICC's envisaged goal of prosecuting senior officials in Syria, but it will not be a swift process.

The U.N. panel said it had also received reports that Assad's forces had carried out indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas with artillery and air strikes.

The panel said it had verified the use of incendiary weapons and chlorine on a large scale in the town of Madaya, west of Aleppo, last month.

"Such indiscriminate attacks have caused the deaths of many civilians, including women and children. The panel has heard credible accounts of the use of incendiary weapons and chlorine during the attack on Madaya," it said.

Pinheiro said the other areas in Syria where the panel had gathered evidence were in the towns of Daraya, Zabadani, and Moadamiyeh, where the government had carried out "massacres and war crimes."

"The panel has also received credible reports of the killing of hundreds of civilians in Daraya and Zabadani, and of indiscriminate shelling of the towns of Moadamiyeh and Madaya in the days following the attacks," he said.

Syria is also facing a U.N. investigation into the use of chemical weapons in the country's civil war, which has killed more than 100,000 people.

Pinheiro said the U.N. mission would be able to investigate any use of chemical weapons in Syria, as well as the recent use of chlorine as a weapon in the town of Madaya.

The European Union has already expanded its blacklist to include 28 individuals and two organizations, including the Syrian government, over alleged war crimes during the six-year conflict.

In March, the EU announced it was expanding sanctions on individuals and entities implicated in the conflict, including those responsible for chemical weapons use, and freezing their assets.

The sanctions targets include Assad's inner circle, including his brother-in-law and defense minister. The EU has identified as many as 24 government officials, including top officials, suspected of involvement in chemical weapons use.<|endoftext|>This is a conversation between Strawberry Marshmallow and (f, 18, coppery inverted bobcut, leather jacket, expressionless face) .

This is the first year I've attempted this and I'm really glad I did. The great thing about this is that you can use it as a starter kit, as an idea to have around the studio, or to help you get started with your own design. In many ways this is a very simple kit.

The kit is made from four easy to find, inexpensive materials – three 1/4″ plywood, two 1/4″ plywood laminates, and two 1/4″ hardboard. We used the laminate for the front panels, and the hardboard for most of the back panels.

Here is the kit assembled. The back panels are held together by two small pieces of 1/4″ plywood glued together.

The kit has a very basic construction, but it does have a few neat features. First the front panels are attached simply by gluing the two sides together and then tightening the two sides together. This is a very fast and easy way to attach the panels.

Second the panels can be snapped together with the strips of wood, which allows you to attach the panels to the wood pieces. The neat thing about this is that you can attach the panels to the wood panels without the strips having any finish on them. This is great for making more complex shapes without any finish or adhesives on the surface.

Finally, you can leave a piece of scrap hardboard at the bottom of the kit. You can then use this to attach the panels to the hardboard and make a small slatted panel.

Here is the completed kit. I would suggest starting with the front panels, as the rear panels are a bit more complicated. The front panels have a little bit of a curved structure, which can be seen in the picture.

Here is a full scale mock-up of the kit.

Now that you've seen the kit in action, check out the video below.

I think I have covered a lot of ground on how to resolve a WordPress username and password problem.

But to recap for those of you who are missing the point, here it is in a nutshell:

If you have a WordPress username and password issue, you can either change your password or change the WordPress username and password.

If you don't have a WordPress username and password issue, you can either change your username or change the WordPress username and password.

The first two options cause the same issues, but the third one has a more significant impact on the security of your WordPress website.

NOTE: You can also change the WordPress username and password by using the WordPress login form.

Before we get started with the options, you need to make sure that your WordPress username and password are correct.

If you change the WordPress username and password you will need to update your database tables in order to match the new username and password.

To do this, you need to give your WordPress administrator permission to update the database.

You can do this by using the following WP administrative commands:

update_passwords();

If you have renamed your WordPress username and password, you will need to update the database tables as well.

This can be done with the following WP administrative commands:

rename_passwords();

If you are not sure whether you have a WordPress username and password issue or not, go to the WordPress admin dashboard and change the username and password.

This will verify if you have a username and password issue.

If you still have a username and password issue, you will need to contact your WordPress administrator for assistance.

If you have a WordPress username and password issue, you will need to contact your WordPress administrator for assistance.

If you don't have a WordPress username and password issue, you can either change your WordPress username or change the WordPress username and password.

Changing the WordPress Username and Password

The good news is that you can change your WordPress username and password.

The bad news is that doing so will cause your WordPress website to become unsecure.

The reason for this is that WordPress has a built-in mechanism that allows administrators to change the WordPress username and password.

This mechanism is called the "admin password reset" feature.

This mechanism is used by most other popular websites as well, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

What you need to do is to use the "admin password reset" feature to allow your WordPress administrator to change your WordPress username and password.

The reason for this is that if you don't allow your WordPress administrator to change your username and password, you can be vulnerable to attackers.

But if you allow the WordPress administrator to change your username and password, you can be vulnerable to attackers, but you can also leave yourself more secure.

How to Change the WordPress Username and Password

Using this mechanism, you can change your WordPress username and password by using the following PHP code:

if(isset($_POST['password']) && isset($_POST['username'])) { $new_username = $_POST['username']; $new_password = $_POST['password']; $old_username = $_POST['username']; $old_password = $_POST['password']; }

This code will allow the WordPress administrator to change your WordPress username and password.

You can use the same code to change a WordPress username and password, but you will need to replace the $_POST['username'] and $_POST['password'] variables with the new values.

For example:

if(isset($_POST['password']) && isset($_POST['username'])) { $new_username = $_POST['username']; $new_password = $_POST['password']; $old_username = $_POST['username']; $old_password = $_POST['password']; }

After using the code above, you will need to change your WordPress username and password using the following PHP code:

if(isset($_POST['password']) && isset($_POST['username']) && isset($_POST['password']) && isset($_POST['username']) && isset($_POST['password']['private'])) { $new_username = $_POST['username']; $new_password = $_POST['password']; $old_username = $_POST['username']; $old_password = $_POST['password']; $new_password = $_POST['password']; $old_username = $_POST['username']; $old_password = $_POST['password']; }

Using the code above, you will need to change your WordPress username and password using the following PHP code:

if(isset($_POST['password'

My concern is not so much that they are too male-centric or male supremacist as it is that they are a party that is so overtly misogynistic and in favor of what I call the "new sexism".

In a recent interview with Politico, I asked the question: "How many women will the GOP elect in the next election?" The answer came in the form of a smile, but with a hint of a chuckle. I was told that the result would be in the single digits.

While I don't agree with the premise that the GOP will lose women voters, it is a fair question that deserves a response.

I do not doubt the sincerity of the question. The fact that the Republican Party has lost so many women to the Democrats is a very serious concern. The fact that it has been losing women voters for over thirty years is even more alarming.

I have written numerous times about the fact that the Republican Party has historically been hostile toward women. I shared a number of examples of how the GOP has been actively hostile toward women, including the fact that. I shared a number of examples of how the GOP has been actively hostile toward women, including the fact that during the 1980s, Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, had a working relationship with a male porn star, and New York Times columnist, Paul Krugman, has been a cheerleader for Republican candidates who want to ban abortion.

Clearly, these examples are not isolated incidents.

And despite the fact that the GOP has been losing women voters for over thirty years, there is very little discussion about the issue. The reason for this is that by and large, men are not willing to admit that the party is a problem.

I have witnessed this before. Last year, I interviewed a number of Republican women who were disgusted with the Republican Party, and many of them said that they would not vote for a Republican who was a woman. I then asked myself an important question: "How could a party that is so intolerant of women and other minorities, be considered more welcoming to men?"

I then posed the question to the men who were in my office, and they all said the same thing: "Maybe it's just the culture."

We have been tolerant of the sexist mindset and attitudes of men for so long that it is difficult for most men to admit that the party is a problem. And many of them don't know how to deal with that fact.

The Republican Party is now viewed as the party of anti-woman policies, and while these policies are in line with the traditional patriarchal view of women, it is the party's policies that have been the problem. The Republicans have a long history of being the party of anti-women. In the current election season, there are some examples of what I call the new sexism.

When the Republicans passed the "personhood" amendment, which would have allowed women to be legally forced to provide birth control to their husbands, I wrote a piece titled, "Why the GOP Supports 'Personhood' Amendment". I pointed out that a majority of Americans and a majority of Republicans support the idea of legal abortion, but the Republican Party is vehemently opposed to legal abortion.

The Republicans' opposition to legal abortion is even more troubling when you consider that the Republican Party has repeatedly tried to pass laws that would allow employers to fire women for being pregnant. Republicans have also tried to pass laws that would allow employers to fire women for being pregnant.

I also have written about the fact that the Republican Party is the only major political party that does not include any women in their leadership team. I have also written about the fact that the Republican Party is the only major political party that does not include any women in their leadership team.

I have written about the fact that the Republican Party is the only major political party that does not include any women in their leadership team.

What is most surprising to me is that some of the men who hang out in my office do not even know that the Republican Party is the party of sexism. I have come to the conclusion that men are too afraid to admit that the party is a problem
======================================== SAMPLE 404 ========================================
The first time I met Carlos Castaneda, the Mexican author of such undeniably brilliant books as One Hundred Years of Solitude and The Teachings of Don Juan, he was in a very different place. He was a man with a long-time reputation for alcoholism and substance abuse, who had been fired from his job as a defense contractor in the early Nineties. He was living in a small house on the outskirts of Mexico City that he referred to as a "pit" and, on the surface, seemed to have failed.

But there was an odd gleam in his eye. For the first time, Castaneda seemed to be experiencing some kind of awakening. He was no longer the tortured soul he had been in his early years. He was learning to speak, to read, to write, and to do something he had never done before—he started a meditation practice.

In an interview with the New York Times, Castaneda said, "I'm trying to be like Buddha. I want to live a life of simplicity, love and respect." When I visited him recently, he was in the middle of a two-year meditation retreat that he led at the age of 71. He told me that he was discovering that he was more in touch with his own humanity than he had ever been.

A year later, Castaneda's life changed dramatically. At the age of 40, he was arrested for selling marijuana and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Not long after his release, he fell ill with a severe case of liver failure and suffered a massive stroke. He was admitted to the hospital for weeks and developed a huge tumor in his brain. It was diagnosed as cancer and he was given six months to live.

Castaneda's first question upon his arrival at the hospital was, "Did I make a mistake?" He had a strong sense of what his life was meant to be and was determined to do it. He was determined to die and he wanted to do it with dignity.

On the day of his discharge he told his family that he was going to go on a guided meditation retreat. He insisted that they could not accompany him, but they did, believing he needed the help, even if it was just for a few days. The first day of the retreat was a blur of meditation and Carlos's delicate hands. He was too weak to move. The next day his left hand was paralyzed. The next morning, his legs were paralyzed. After a few days of being paralyzed, he began to feel normal and began to take deep breaths and expand his consciousness.

He was able to walk, to see his family, to drive in his car and even to work. He even took a few classes with an instructor that he had worked with in the past.

Castaneda's spirit never wavered. He never lost hope. He continued to meditate, even during his paralysis. When he was diagnosed with cancer, he continued to meditate. When he returned from the hospital, he continued to meditate. When he was paralyzed again, he continued to meditate. When he was paralyzed for the last time, he continued to meditate.

For all his ups and downs, Castaneda never gave up on his meditative practice. He was able to continue to focus without the use of his left hand and he is able to do everything that he used to do before he was paralyzed.

After his stroke, Castaneda realized what a gift he had been given in life. He was given the gift of a lifetime.

He was given the gift of being able to live a life of simplicity, love and respect.

Carlos Castaneda is a man who has lived a life of incredible grace and compassion. He has given his life to the service of humanity and the spirit of love and compassion that has made him who he is.

Carlos Castaneda's stories of suffering, bravery, commitment and compassion inspire as much as his amazing writing.

What is your story? What is your life story?

As an author, I have become used to the idea that if I want to write a story about a life, I need to give it a beginning, a middle and an end. I need to tell a story that will set up the reader to have an emotional connection to the characters and their journey. I need to tell a story that will make you want to read more about them.

I have been thinking about this for a long time and I think it's time for me to break this rule.

In 2004, the San Francisco 49ers adopted a new logo that was originally intended to be a nod to the city's Mission District. But the logo stood out for being quite un-San Francisco.

The logo is called the "barbershop" or "ghost" logo, and it was designed by the team's art director, Matt Chaney, who was hired in August of that year.

The team has tried to make the logo work for the past few years, but it's just not quite right. At least, that's what I think.

That's why I'm telling you to take this quiz. And no, I won't tell you how to answer.

The 49ers have tried to make the logo work for years, but it's just not quite right.

I never liked the ghost logo, even though I thought it was a nifty logo. The logo was always too much like a barbershop, as opposed to a baseball cap. It had a cheap, light-colored and plastic feel to it.

It also looked like it was from 1884. That was before the advent of modern-day logos.

In the end, the 49ers were forced to change the logo. They tried to paint their way out of this one, but in the end, it was just too much of a mess.

The new logo was introduced in 2013, but it didn't really change the logo's identity. It was just different.

That's not to say I don't like the new logo. I do. It's a much better logo than the one they had in 2004.

Here's the thing though: The new logo is just not what the team was going for when they made the logo in the first place.

The team wanted to make a "San Francisco" logo that could stand out from a sea of team logos. But that's just not what the team got.

So the logo will always be regarded as less than awesome.

I'm sure you've seen the 2004 logo at some point in your life. Maybe you even know the name Matt Chaney.

But have you ever stopped and thought to yourself, "Wow, that's kind of like me."

It's not that the new logo isn't a nice logo. It is. But it's not what the team was going for.

If you know me, you know I'm not too big on logos. But I will admit, the new logo is pretty cool.<|endoftext|>It's been a while since we've had a new game on the site, and we're really excited to announce that we have a new game on the way!

It's hard to imagine life before the Internet.

For most of its history, we relied on one another and the world wide web for news and entertainment. The Internet was a momentous change — a way for strangers from all over the world to connect and share information and entertain themselves. It became a place where we found out about our loved ones, our friends and our worst fears.

Today, the Internet has evolved into an enterprise of mammoth proportions, with millions of businesses, government agencies and individuals using it to conduct business. It's a place where you can find news, information and entertainment from around the world, and where you can phone your friend's girlfriend to tell her you love her.

But after so many years of growth and innovation, we can no longer ignore the looming threat of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are not just a theoretical threat. They are happening right now — and they can be very damaging.

Making matters worse, the Russian government has been aggressively seeking to interfere with our elections. Recent reports suggest that the Kremlin has hacked into the servers of political organizations and hacked into the Democratic National Committee's email system. The public has been left in the dark about the extent of this Russian interference, despite widespread conclusions by high-profile cyber-investigators.

The United States must take action to stop cyber-attacks. In fact, the United States has already taken extreme measures to protect our election infrastructure and we will continue to take additional steps as necessary.

Much more needs to be done. But if we don't, the damage to our political system and our democracy may be irrevocably done.

This is why I have called for a bipartisan, bicameral commission to investigate the Russian government's role in interfering in our election. The American people deserve to know the full extent of this Russian interference. We cannot afford to wait for the next election. We need to act now before it's too late.

Specifically, we need to:

1. Investigate the Russian government's role in interfering in our election and whether any members of the Trump campaign were involved. A special prosecutor should be appointed to lead this investigation.

2. Create a commission to investigate the role of Russia in interfering in our election and the Trump campaign's involvement.

3. Impose sanctions on Russia for their malicious activities during the election.

4. Create a commission to investigate possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.

5. Impose sanctions on Russia for their malicious activities during the election.

New Delhi: Have you ever wondered where the most popular Indian languages are?

A recent survey done by the Pew Research Centre, a global research organisation, has revealed that Hindi is the most widely spoken language in the country and the second most widely spoken in the world after English.

The study also revealed that India has the highest proportion of people who are proficient in Hindi — 9% — and the second highest proportion of people who are proficient in English — 5% — and that more than half of the people in India and the United States use both Hindi and English.

"Hindi is the most widely spoken language in India, with its use in textbooks, on television, and in the media. It is also the second most widely spoken language in the world after English. Hindi is very much a part of our lives, yet many people in India do not speak it at home or at school.

"Hindi is also a topic of discussion in informal conversations with friends and family. In the United States, Hindi is the third most commonly spoken language after English and Spanish and is the most spoken language in the Middle East and North Africa.

"In India, Hindi is used as the language of education; in the United States, it is the language of business; in the Middle East, Hindi is used as the language of government; in the United Kingdom, it is the language of the media, and in Australia it is the language of the higher education system," said Jasmine Budhraja, the lead author of the study.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has more than 200 guidelines for common conditions including diabetes, dementia and cataracts. But how much of this advice is based on good evidence?

A new report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has found that only 8% of the NICE guidelines are now based on good evidence.

"A lot of us think NICE is so good because it says what we want to hear," says Professor John Hawksworth, director of the IFS. "But where does the evidence come from to support the decisions which are being made?"

The IFS says that NICE's reliance on "evidence-based" statements with "low confidence" ratings "has become an increasingly problematic problem".

The committee of senior economists say that the agency has been making poor decisions about the evidence for three decades.

"It's a not-so-healthy state of affairs," says Hawksworth, "but it's not necessarily going to change."

The report, All About Evidence: NICE's Evidence of Ease, asks whether NICE's evidence-based statements really are as simple as they sound.

The IFS is not the first to criticise NICE's approach. The Institute of Medicine, the UK's health policy research body, has previously said that "there is little evidence that evidence-based advice from NICE helps patients".

'Constant changes'

This week the committee published a letter from 22 leading experts asking NICE to publish a national evidence strategy to guide its decisions.

NICE says it is committed to evidence-based advice and welcomes the IFS report.

"We take the IFS report on board," says a NICE spokesperson.

"We are already working on the development of a national evidence strategy but we're not ready to release it yet."

The spokesperson adds that NICE is "continuing to review the evidence we use to inform our decisions and develop our recommendations".

But the IFS says that NICE is making no progress in improving its evidence-based guidelines.

"NICE's evidence-based statements have become a constant source of controversy," says Hawksworth.

"The evidence-based approach has become something of a joke."<|endoftext|>The Fraser Institute has released a report on the GDP per capita of Canada, which it says is the highest in the G7.

The report, which is based on figures from the World Bank, says Canada is at the top because it has "the highest average living standard among its G7 peers and the highest per capita GDP in the G7."

The report notes that Canada's per capita GDP is also the highest among its G7 peers.

The report says Canada's GDP per capita is at $42,000, compared to the OECD average of $27,700.

It says Canada's economy has grown by 2.5 per cent per year, compared to the OECD average of 2.75 per cent.

The report notes that Canada's GDP per capita is highest among the G7, with the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan at $42,000, Canada at $40,600, and the United States at $40,000.

The Fraser Institute says Canada's GDP per capita is also the highest among its G7 peers. (Fiscal Times)

It also says that Canada is the only G7 country where the share of GDP spent on health care is at or below the OECD average.

The report says that the United States spends seven per cent of its GDP on health care, but that Canada spends eight per cent.

The report says that Canada's health care spending is at or below the OECD average, but its overall health status is below the OECD average.

The Fraser Institute says it is a "remarkable achievement" that Canada has the lowest life expectancy of its G7 peers, at 71.6 years, and that it has achieved "the highest female life expectancy."

It says Canada's life expectancy includes the gap between men and women and that "Canada has the highest proportion of elderly men and the lowest proportion of elderly women."

Canada's life expectancy is also at or below the OECD average. (Fiscal Times)

The report says that Canada's female life expectancy is 69.2 years, compared to the OECD average of 77.1 years.

It says Canada's male life expectancy is 77.6 years, compared to the OECD average of 79.7 years.

That's a lot of food to eat in a week. In this case, it's just about the entire universe.

The universe is what you get when you take all the particles contained in the universe, multiply them by 100 billion, and then multiply that by the speed of light. That's all of the particles and forces in the universe.

That's the whole universe.

The universe is actually incredibly big. If we just wrote every particle and force in the universe down, it would exceed the size of the entire observable universe.

From the big bang to the beginning of time, we've been living in a universe that was largely composed of particles and forces. That's why the universe we see today, even though its very small, is extremely diverse.

The universe isn't static. It's constantly expanding and contracting. It's expanding so much that it eventually wraps itself around itself. That's why it's called the Big Rip. The universe is a big blob, and if you took it all and folded it up into a flag, it would fit in a baseball. It's like the universe is like a pancake with holes in it.

Every new time it happened, the universe expanded until it filled all of the space between the stars. This happened about 13.8 billion years ago. The expansion continues to this day. The universe is expanding at a rate of about 100 kilometers per second.

The universe is filled with all kinds of particles and forces. The big bang created the first quarks, the building blocks of atoms. When the universe first began to expand, the universe was filled with neutral hydrogen, which was composed of one proton and one neutron.

The universe began to contract as it expanded. At any moment, we can see the universe shrinking. However, it's never completely stopped expanding. As it continues to expand, it will eventually fill up the entire observable universe.

When the universe was created, the temperature of the primordial soup was about 1,000 degrees Kelvin. The density of the primordial soup was about 1,000,000 grams per cubic centimeter. The universe now contains more than 100 billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion

There is a lot of news coming out about the Confederacy, and we thought we'd let you know who we think is fit to lead the confederacy.

U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin has ordered a new trial for John Hinckley Jr., the man convicted of killing President Ronald Reagan.

Hinckley's attorneys said they will appeal the ruling in the federal appeals court in New York.

Scheindlin, in her ruling, said the trial judge erred when she allowed the jury to consider the possibility that the gun used to kill Reagan had been fired by Hinckley.

Scheindlin said the jury's verdict was flawed because jurors were not allowed to consider what Hinckley had said about the President as he was led into a Washington, D.C., federal courtroom in the hours following the shooting.

"The court concludes on the record that the jury was not properly instructed regarding the evidence regarding Hinckley's motivation and offer of proof in the form of his notes and the transcripts of his telephone conversation with Dr. Seidenberg," the ruling said.

Hinckley was convicted in the 1981 shooting of Reagan and other people. The case was the first of its kind in the country when Hinckley hired a private psychiatrist to analyze his mental state.

The psychiatrist concluded that Hinckley was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, which came from his time in the military, according to court documents.

Hinckley was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but was released in May of this year.

Hinckley's attorneys argued that the government had failed to make a convincing case for a mental illness and failed to prove that Hinckley was aware of his actions, according to the New York Times.

They also said his trial was disrupted because prosecutors changed prosecutor's instructions mid-trial, according to the Daily News.

The New York Times said the ruling could have wide-reaching ramifications for the defendant, who is set to be released on parole in January.

It is my impression that most of us need to start learning how to use visual memory to help us remember things.

When we are learning a new phrase or a phrase that we already know we can use visual memory. We can use it to recall the word in our head, to remember pictures of things.

I won't go into the details of how to use visual memory. I found the best method to learn to use visual memory is to practice it in your own life. You need to try and practise it in front of a mirror, a window, a door. You could try to practise it in your own living room, your office, a bus, your car, the bus you take to work, your bed, your bedroom, your floor, your school, your library, your gym, your car, your office, your bedroom.

I remember I used to practice visual memory in the school library. I would take photos of all the books I was studying and I would even take photos of the graphics, because I couldn't always remember what words were in books, and I would be able to remember the words visually, not only with pictures.

Some people believe that in ancient times, the world was divided into two parts: the upper world and the lower world. Each part was ruled by a different number of people. But the ultimate ruler of the lower world was the number one man, one woman. In the upper world, number two was the ruler.

So, over time, this number was added. Over time, it became two, and then three, and then four, and then three. Eventually, it got to number one. That is how the world became divided into two parts: the upper world and the lower world.

This number is called the number of the beast, a name attributed to Jesus Christ by John the Baptist.<|endoftext|>The validators module allows you to validate forms. It has no dependencies other than the standard module autoload .

"I think it's fair to say that the most important thing with the Prenda case is that they were able to get a judge to sign off on a pretrial order that the lawyers that they had hired, they were able to get Judge Wright to sign off on that, but when you look at the records, the statements from the attorneys that they were using and the way that they were using it, those statements were not supported by the evidence," said Paul Duffy, an attorney who represented the porn company.<|endoftext|>This is the first of a series of posts that will be looking at the Crossrail project from different perspectives.

The question of how to connect the east and west of London has divided opinion since the North-South Rail Link was proposed. One camp believes that a high-speed rail network will help us cut congestion through the centre of the capital, while the other believes that it will induce a new housing boom and make our already crowded cities even more so.

The debate has not changed much since the North-South Rail Link was first proposed. The amount of money that will be needed to build this project is very high, and the benefits only begin to come into play once the railway is built. But the debate has changed in the last few years. In 2012, the Government's Strategic Rail Authority produced a report that criticised the current transport system for being too complicated, and suggested that it could be replaced by a network of high-speed rail links.

In 2014, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, commissioned a study of how to improve London's transport system. It identified a need for a new interchange between the northern and southern rail lines, and called for a high-speed, five-mile-plus network to be built across the capital that would connect the north to the south.

The South-North Rail Link

The North-South Rail Link (N-SRL) is a proposal to replace the existing Northern and Southern rail lines, with a new interchange station at Barking Riverside railway station in east London in place of Victoria.

The N-SRL would provide a single point of contact for all connecting services between London and Birmingham. No longer would passengers and goods have to make their way through a series of intermediate stations, each of which has its own set of problems.

A new interchange station would also reduce the number of small transfers between trains. Currently, passengers transferring between several trains would have to wait around for the next one to leave. It would be safer and more convenient for passengers to have just one ticket to travel between two stations.

The N-SRL will also reduce journey times, particularly between London and Birmingham. Currently, people travelling between London and Birmingham have to spend around 40 minutes travelling from the west to the east of the city, and around 30 minutes travelling from the north to the south. The N-SRL would reduce this to just 20 minutes.

This is really good news for those who live and work in the south of London, as it would give them the opportunity to travel to work faster than before.

It's unclear what prices will be charged at the new interchange station, but any fare will be comparable to which they currently pay at Victoria, making it easy for many people to switch from buses to trains.

The proposed changes have been welcomed by many. The National Railway Museum, the National Railway Museum Trust, the London Transport Museum and the National Railway Museum (NMR) have all welcomed the N-SRL as a worthwhile initiative.

However, there are some who are sceptical about the value of a new railway interchange. Critics of the N-SRL say that it will only serve the passengers who already use the Victoria line. In response, the Government says that a new interchange will be needed in the future, but that it will be far cheaper than building new stations in the city.

The new station at Barking Riverside, which will be built along the current railway line, will be linked to the existing Victoria line by a new tunnel. The proposed new interchange station will be built along the new railway line.

This is very different to the existing interchange at Barking Riverside station. This is a very busy commuter station, which is also a major interchange for the Victoria, District and Circle lines. It is used by tens of thousands of passengers each day, including thousands of passengers who switch between trains.

The proposed new station at Barking Riverside station would be far cheaper to build than the existing Victoria station.

The Victorian station, for example, cost the taxpayer £9.7m in 2009/10, while Barking Riverside station cost just £1.9m. The cost of the new interchange station is much lower, as it would only be built if the NMR received a grant from Government.

Barking Riverside station is just one station along the District and Circle lines, but it is the busiest station on the Victoria line. It is also the most important

Russia's economy has been in a recession since the beginning of 2009, and the Russian economy is growing at an annual rate of 2.7 percent. Through this recession, the Russian economy has dropped from being the 7th largest economy in the world in 1990 to the 10th largest economy in 2009. Russia's GDP per capita is $16,000, the lowest of any country. The United States, on the other hand, has the highest GDP per capita of any country in the world, at $51,000.

Even though the United States has the highest GDP per capita, the United States is not the world's largest economy. China is the only country that is larger than the United States. China's GDP per capita is $11,600, and the United States' GDP per capita is $45,300. China's GDP per capita is also the highest of any country with a GDP of over $10 million.

The United States' economic slowdown is due in part to lower oil prices and Western sanctions. However, the United States suffers from many problems, such as its large federal debt, high income inequality, and a low labor force participation rate.<|endoftext|>Now, I am one of the craziest people in the world. I will say that, because it's true. I'm a big fan of zombies. I totally got into the zombie apocalypse genre when I saw World War Z. It was pretty amazing. I'm also a big fan of the zombie series The Walking Dead. I know, I know. You don't get to see a zombie series this way. And, I know. I'm full of shit. Because if you're reading this, you're probably one of the craziest people on the planet. You're probably also one of the most devoted readers I have ever had. I'm glad I'm not the only one.

If you're read Top Shelf Presents, you know that I'm a big fan of World War Z. I love that it's the first zombie movie that I've ever seen. I love that it's the film that got me into the zombie apocalypse genre. I love that it was the film that got me into the genre of zombie movies.

I'm not going to tell you how I feel about the film. You can read about it here. I will say, though, that I think it's a great film. It's got a lot going for it, but I don't think it's the best zombie film out there. I think it's a great film, but I do think it's one of the weaker zombie films out there. I'm not going to say it's the worst zombie film, because I think it's one of the better zombie films out there. But, I don't think it's the best zombie film.

If you haven't seen the film, you should go buy it right now. The film is out on Blu-Ray/DVD and DVD now. It's a great film. You should go and buy it now. It's a great film.

I'm going to get through this post, because I'm so excited to talk about David Fincher. David Fincher is one of the most important directors in the history of cinema. He's a filmmaker known for his films that are self-aware and ironic. He's a filmmaker known for being a director who's really good at approaching the genre of film that he's working in. And, to top it all off, he's one of the best directors in the world.

In The Social Network, he's writing a screenplay, but he's also directing the film. In his film, he's a writer, but he's also a director. And, in many ways, that's what's so amazing about him. He approaches filmmaking from two sides at once. On the one hand, he's a writer, and he's a director. On the other hand, he's a filmmaker, and he's also a writer. And, that's what makes his films so great.

Fincher is a writer. He's a writer on the page. But, he also is a director on the screen. And, it's a really brilliant approach to filmmaking. It's a really brilliant approach to filmmaking, that has got us all

The settlement was reached in May after the company was sued for failing to provide adequate coverage to its troops stationed in the country.

The agreement was reached after the families of Kori Ali Muhammad, 36, and Dustin Eugene Wright, 33, filed a lawsuit against the company. They alleged the company had been negligent for not providing adequate coverage for their loved ones.

The two men lost their lives in a tragic shooting in March 2007. Their deaths were the first U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq since the 2003 invasion.

In May, USAA agreed to pay $10 million to the families. The company also agreed to hire an independent monitor to oversee its business practices throughout Iraq.

The company said it began monitoring its activities in Iraq in June 2007, and that it "has already taken steps to prevent further injuries, deaths, and property damage to service members."

The settlement was announced by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and David B. Cohen, the former head of the Justice Department's criminal division. The two men also criticized insurance companies for their lack of accountability in the cases of Iraq war casualties.

"The insurance companies in Iraq, instead of taking responsibility for their risky business practices, have continued to profit at the expense of American soldiers and their families." Holder said in a statement.

Cohen, who served as a senior prosecutor in the Justice Department's criminal division under President George W. Bush, said the case was the first time that the Justice Department has pursued a civil suit over the insurance industry's failure to properly cover military members.

"Insurance companies and their agents in Iraq were not accountable for the consequences of their behavior, and the families of these two American soldiers are the victims of their actions," Cohen said.

Representatives of USAA declined to comment.<|endoftext|>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Is it too late for a bailout of the eurozone?

Eurozone finance ministers have agreed to an emergency bailout of the single currency's weakest member - Cyprus.

In a humiliating defeat for the EU, it was vetoed by Spain, which has vetoes over all Greek and Portuguese decisions.

The Greek PM said the result was "a political failure and a eurozone failure".

Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said a deal would "put an end to the drama".

What happened?

Spain, which holds a veto vote on eurozone matters, said it would not support the bailout, arguing that the €10bn (£8bn) offered by the eurozone was not enough to protect Cyprus.

The EU said it was the first time that a eurozone country had been forced to seek an external bailout.

The decision was meant to be taken by the finance ministers of the 17 countries which use the euro, but the session had to be adjourned so that Spain, which has a veto, could come out against the Cyprus bailout.

Analysis In the end, the Spanish and Italian governments were not really able to block the deal, but they were a lot more effective than they looked. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had always pushed the idea that a deal would be done, but her personal intervention was the most important factor. If she had not been there, the Spanish and Italian governments would have been able to block it. Once they had given the green light for it to be approved, it became a political no-brainer for the parties in the eurozone. The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and the Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa also had to give their support, but the rest of the Eurogroup - the other 17 eurozone countries - were too divided on the issue to have a strong effect. That has been a major disappointment for many in the

In the early spring of 1984, I was in the sixth grade at Eastern High School in West Palm Beach, where ninety-seven percent of the student body attended Catholic schools. I was a regular at the Catholic school's weekly chapel service, where I often sat in the pew next to the girls who were married and had children. On the Sunday before Easter, as we watched the Easter service on the television in the chapel, a young couple walked into the pew with a child in their arms.

The parents, both young clergy, were clearly struggling with the problem of how to best honor their daughter, who had been gravely injured in an accident. The young mother was about forty-something and was wearing a flowing red dress, a gold headband, and a sash that looked as if it had been made for a saint. The young man was about twenty-one and was wearing a blue vest and a black tie.

The couple approached the pew and bowed their heads, and that's when the young man, who was wearing a white shirt and a gray suit, got up from his seat and began to walk towards the aisle. The young woman, who was wearing a white dress and a green shawl, stood up and walked after him.

"Excuse me," said the young man. "Would you please move? I have a child in my arms."

"We live in the country," she replied. "I couldn't believe that a grown man would come up to a child."

The young man, however, didn't see the child.

He continued to walk to the aisle and when he reached the end of the aisle, he turned around to face the young woman, who had kept pace with him all the way down the aisle.

"Excuse me," said the young man. "Would you please move? I have a child in my arms."

The young woman looked at the child in her arms. Her eyes were large and clear. She took a deep breath, and then she looked up at the adult and said, "I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean it."

The young man walked over to the child, placed his hand on the child's shoulder, and said, "It's okay, baby. I'm here."

The young man and the young woman stood there for a few moments, looking at each other. The young woman then walked up to the young man and placed her hand on his shoulder. The young man looked at the child in her arms and then looked back at the young woman.

"It's okay, baby," said the young woman. "I'm here."

The young man looked at her and said, "It's okay, baby. I'm here."

The young man walked back to the aisle and the young girl in her arms. As the young woman walked back to the pew, she turned and faced the young man, who was still standing next to the child.

"Excuse me, sir," said the young woman. "Would you please move?"

"We live in the country," he replied.

"I couldn't believe that a grown man would come up to a child," she replied.

Kelvin Benjamin is expected to miss the rest of the preseason and most likely the rest of the season, according to multiple reports.

Benjamin tore his ACL in his knee in the Panthers' regular-season opener against the Saints. He underwent surgery to repair the torn ACL Monday and will miss the remainder of the preseason and the first four games of the regular season.

Benjamin, who was playing at an All-Pro level in his rookie season, is now expected to miss the remainder of the season, which would mean he would miss the entire 2017 season, as well.

Benjamin originally suffered the injury in the third quarter of Carolina's Week 1 win against the Browns, which was one of the most dominant performances from a wide receiver in recent memory. Benjamin caught nine passes for 207 yards and a touchdown, including a 19-yard touchdown pass that showcased his route-running ability.

The Panthers lost their first-round pick in next year's draft to the Saints for Benjamin's injury, which was the second time in his career that he suffered a significant injury. Benjamin suffered a torn ACL in training camp in 2015 and missed the entire preseason before returning for the final six games of the season.

And while that's certainly true and it's hard to deny, there's one instrument that can sound bigger than life and still sound like an instrument. And that instrument is the cello.

"I like the cello for its ability to deliver the right notes very clearly," says cellist and composer Joe Pugliese, who is working on a new album, The Holy City, with cellist and composer Mick Fleetwood. "It's a powerful and expressive instrument."

Pugliese brings up an important point: Cellists today are using the same techniques as the early cellists, which are often very similar to those used by the cello masters. "Musicians are now using the techniques of the 19th century cellists," Pugliese says. "They're using the same techniques and the same technique, which is the scalar vibrato, is still used."

A Scalar Vibrato

In the video below, Pugliese explains what a scalar vibrato is:

"The scalar vibrato is a technique in the cello where you move the bow back and forth in a circular motion, like a bow sweeping back and forth, to create a wide sweep. The cellist will select a note that's slightly higher than the one that he wants to vibrate, and then he will slide the bow back and forth in a circular motion, and as the bow passes over the note he will

How do you make a second home in the city?

A whole lot of money.

And an even bigger problem for the city: it takes a lot of money to keep the city clean.

The city's annual budget for garbage collection, which was $26 million in 2014, is roughly $200 million.

And that's just the garbage that's picked up.

On top of that, the city spends hundreds of millions of dollars on waste management, sewer and water infrastructure, and parks and recreation.

The city's budget is so huge, it has to be balanced by cutting spending elsewhere.

City staff have access to a variety of tools to help them balance the books.

Initiatives like Neighbourhood Renewal, which is working to improve neighbourhoods, have been in place since 2006.

They've received more than $14 million in funding to date.

And they're an example of how the city's budget can be used to improve people's lives.

Coun. Jason Farr says the city is in a very different place than it was when he first got elected in 2012.

"For us, we're really at the tipping point," Farr said. "And I think that what we're doing is really beneficial to the city and really beneficial to the neighbourhoods and the people who live in them. I think that's a really positive, forward-looking message."

"We can do better than we are right now."

A new report from the city's auditor has some suggestions on how the city could use its money more wisely.

"It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of many of the initiatives and programs," the report states.

"The lack of rigorous and reliable metrics cannot be attributed to a lack of effort on the part of government."

The report recommends the city look at how it spends money on a number of initiatives.

They include:

Neighbourhood Renewal, which has committed $14.2 million to renovate and transform 127 neighbourhoods across the city.

The city's Strategic Land Use Plan, which has funded the creation of over a half-dozen urban design-based communities.

The city's Task Force on the Future of Vancouver, which was created in response to the 2010 Olympic Village report.

And the city's Green Economy Strategy, which recently generated $5 million for the city's green infrastructure.

The report also recommends the city look at how it spends money on a number of programs.

More funding for the arts

The City of Vancouver is also looking at how it spends money on the arts.

In 2015, the city made $7.8 million available to fund artists commissions, including $2.7 million towards the 2016/17 season.

Many of those funds go toward the Vancouver International Arts Festival.

The festival runs from June 11 to September 22 and is expected to bring in $13.7 million in revenue this year.

The city is also looking at ways to make things even smoother for artists when it comes to accessing public funding.

For example, the city recently announced a new grant program for artists.

And as part of that, it's looking at whether to make it easier for artists to apply for grants.

The city says that by the end of the year, it'll be able to give artists more information about grants they're eligible for.

It'll also be looking at whether to streamline the process for artists applying for funding.

"We're looking at recommendations and we're going through a process of actually putting the suggestions into practice," said Coun. Mike Savage.

"I think that's a very big issue, and I think it's something we need to work on."

More money for the arts

But not everyone agrees with the mayor's desire for more money for the arts.

"I don't think that the arts are good for the city," said Coun. Michael Wiebe.

"I don't think that they contribute to the vibrancy of the city. I don't think they add to the vitality of the city. I think they're an object of scorn of the public.

"I think that the arts are a very important part of the city, but I think that they need to be managed in a very careful way."

As his third season comes to a close, Brian Holman catches up with the Toronto Blue Jays' manager and general manager, John Gibbons.

It's been a long, bumpy road for the Blue Jays this season, and a much shorter one for Gibbons.

After a season of questioning his own role in the organization and being forced to find a way to make it work, Gibbons is now in his third season in charge of a Blue Jays team that is well within reach of making the playoffs.

In a wide-ranging interview with Sportsnet's John Gibbons, the Toronto Blue Jays' manager speaks candidly on everything from the team's struggles to his relationship with his boss, the team's general manager.

Gibbons also addresses why he was so surprised that the Jays traded one of their closer's for a starting pitcher in the off-season, how baseball can take away the fun from the game, and why he believes the Jays are a playoff team.

Check out the full interview below:

John Gibbons, Toronto Blue Jays manager and general manager:

What are your thoughts on the season so far?

"That's a good question. I think it's been a difficult year. It's been a rollercoaster. We've had a lot of highs and lows. It's been a rollercoaster.

I think a lot of it is growing pains. We dealt with some injuries. We traded a guy that was a big part of our bullpen. We became a better team, but you know, we're not out of it yet. You know, we're in a position to make a run at the playoffs. You know, we're in a place where we can win the wild card. So, it's a rollercoaster.

But I think we've been a better team. I think we've been a better team overall. I think we've improved our team. And even though we're not in the playoffs, we're in a position to make a run at it.

What was your first thought when you heard about the trade [for closer Roberto Osuna]?

"I was disappointed. But we've got a lot of good players in the bullpen. And we're going to have to see how it goes. I don't think it's going to be a drastic change. But we're going to have to see how it goes."

What's your relationship with John?

"I've always felt comfortable with John. I've always felt a lot of respect for him. I'm not one to talk to John about anything. It's not like I have to. He knows I'm not going to say anything."

Did you expect the trade to be made?

"No. I don't think anybody expected it to be made. I think it was going to be something I was going to have to deal with, and I guess it was something we were going to have to deal with.

John's been great. I've got a great relationship with him. I really do."

How do you think you're going to be described by the media once the season ends?

"I don't know yet. I don't really know. I feel like I'm going to be like a lot of other guys, maybe. I don't know, I don't know how that's going to come."

Do you think you're being unfairly painted as a leader on this team?

"I don't think it's too much to say that we're a good young team. I think we've got an outstanding group of young players. I think we're a team that has a lot of talent. I think we have a lot of young guys that have a lot of good ideas. I think we have a lot of young guys that have a lot of character. I think that's why we're in the position we're in. I think we've got a lot of potential and a lot of good things ahead of us."

Can you talk about your relationship with John?

"We've always been good friends. We've been really good friends. We work together. We talk together. I think that's why we're in this position we're in. I think that's why like I say, he knows I'm not going to say anything."

Have you been able to get to know John's former teammates?

"I think I've gotten to know a lot of them, but I don't know. I don't really get to get to know them, obviously. So, I'm not in a position to get to know them."

Do you think you've earned the respect of your teammates?

"I've earned the respect of the players. I've earned their respect. I think it's something I've done in the past. I think I've earned their respect. I

Two years ago, we heard rumors that a trio of Japanese companies were working on a new, high-end, Android-powered Note phablet. We couldn't confirm, and for a while, the rumor sat on the backburner as Samsung focused on the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge.

But then it came back to life with a bang, and we were finally able to confirm that it was true. The new Note, the Galaxy Note 5, will launch this September in a new, bigger size, and it will also come with a new, more powerful processor.

The device will also have a big jump in battery life, and it will have a new design, according to a new report from Korean news site ETNews.

ETNews says that according to Samsung, the new Note 5 will have a 5.7-inch display, a 2,560 x 1,440 resolution, a Snapdragon 810 processor, and 3GB of RAM. The device also likely won't be the same size as the Note 4's 5.7-inch display, but it's likely to be the same size as the Note 3's 5.5-inch display.

The new Note 5 will also have a new (and more powerful) camera that's said to have a f1.7 aperture, and a larger battery. It also should have a 6.3mm bezel, just like the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5.

The Note 5 will also come with a stylus, as well as a new AI assistant called Bixby that will be pre-installed on the device. Samsung is expected to use Bixby to pull you away from apps and websites and allow you to more efficiently use the device.

Rumors of the new Note 5 started last October, when Samsung was said to be developing a larger-screen phablet with a 5.7-inch display. That device has not yet been announced.

Samsung has recently been testing the waters with smaller-screened handsets, with the Galaxy A series of smartphones and the Galaxy J series of smartphones. The company has also been rumored to launch a smaller, cheaper Galaxy A3 successor.

The new Galaxy Note is expected to be released in a new round of colors with a metal back panel, and a gold-colored version is expected to be released in September.

Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<|endoftext|>A convicted child molester who served as a football coach in Louisiana said he was a victim of racial prejudice and a lack of free speech when he was banned from speaking at his alma mater.

"I just don't think you should be allowed to express your opinion about anything," said Gary Covington, who has been fired as the head football coach at Marshall University and is facing a second criminal trial for molesting boys.

"I've been black, I've been white, I've been Latino. I can't speak my mind. And that's the problem."

Covington was a star player at Marshall, where he played linebacker from 1978-81. He was a three-time All-American and played 24 years in the NFL, including six with the New Orleans Saints.

Covington said he was banned from speaking at Marshall after he made comments about his former football coach, Mike Rhoades, who is white.

The coach, Rhoades, is now out of coaching.

Covington said he had given a talk to trustees and students at Marshall about his life and his prior football career.

"I'm not a racist. It's just that the word 'racist' is part of my past," Covington told The Associated Press on Tuesday. "I don't think I am a racist. I don't think I've ever been racist. I'm not a bigot."

The former assistant coach said he had not announced plans to speak at Marshall, which is about 45 miles north of New Orleans, before he was fired last month. He said he was not aware of the pending university hearing.

"I just want to get the truth out," Covington said. "I don't want to see my name in the papers on anything I have to say."

Covington was convicted in 2005 on charges of molesting two boys and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was released from prison in May.

On Sept. 28, Covington was charged with molesting a third boy. He was arraigned on those charges on Tuesday and released on $50,000 bond.

"I just want to know what happened in the past," Covington said. "I didn't want to be here talking about my past. I didn't do anything."

The Associated Press does not identify victims of sexual abuse.

Covington said he was not aware of the possibility that he would have to return to

Two months after the death of a woman who died during a traffic stop, a grand jury decided not to indict any of the officers involved, the Austin Police Department announced Tuesday.

Carmen "Carmella" Hernandez was stopped on June 15, 2015, for speeding on Interstate 35. She was not wearing a seat belt, and had recently lost her job because she couldn't afford to drive to work, according to a probable cause statement.

She was found to have a blood alcohol content of .236 percent, which is more than twice the legal limit. A breathalyzer test showed her blood alcohol content to be .228 percent, according to the statement.

[Officers' body cameras were not turned on in Sandra Bland's death, authorities say]

During the stop, Hernandez was asked if she had been drinking. She told police that she had been drinking, but did not immediately remember what happened, according to the statement.

He then asked her if she was intoxicated. She told him she was not, but was unable to remember if she had consumed any alcohol. Then Hernandez said she would need to take a breathalyzer test, and asked if he could get a breathalyzer. Hernandez said that she needed to take the test to get a job because she was unable to pay for the car she was driving.

Hernandez then got out of her vehicle and was arrested for DUI.

Hernandez died the next day. She had been arrested for driving while intoxicated in 2013, according to court records.

On Tuesday, the Austin American-Statesman reported that Hernandez's family had filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Austin police.

"We are now left with the task of pursuing justice through the criminal justice system," her sister, Laurie Hernandez, said in a statement released by the family's attorneys. "I am heartbroken, anguished and furious to learn that there was no one who cared enough to make sure this family's privacy was protected by notifying them that their loved one was dead.

"The family's deepest desire is to make sure that this does not happen to another family, and we hope that the parties involved will work together to ensure that the justice system works for everyone."

A lawyer for the city of Austin said he could not comment on pending litigation, but noted that the city's use-of-force policy says that officers "will not use deadly force unless they have probable cause to believe the subject poses a threat to the life or limb of the officer or another person."

The statement said the city's police watchdog will investigate the case.

"We are at a point in time where our officers are trained, and we do not see this as a situation we can ignore," said Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo. "We have, as it relates to this case, a policy that says when we pull somebody over, we have to ask them whether they were intoxicated and, if they say yes, we can take them into custody."

The case is the second in as many weeks to involve an officer being cleared of any wrongdoing in the death of a citizen. In the fatal shooting of 25-year-old Alton Sterling, police said that the officer involved in the shooting had been "exonerated" by a grand jury, but in the shooting death of Philando Castile, the officer involved was cleared of any wrongdoing.

The decision affirmed a lower court's ruling that police can't search cell phones without a warrant, and said that the practices are probably unconstitutional. But there are still at least three ways police can get phone data without a warrant.

The most obvious way is to buy the phone outright and search it with a warrant. But the FBI doesn't sell cell phones; it buys them. It's a well-known fact that the FBI buys cell phones not just from manufacturers like Apple and Nokia but from third parties.

The FBI buys cell phones from a variety of companies, including Sprint and Verizon. They can also buy them in bulk from a company called DT Communications. The company is owned by two brothers named Thomas and Robert Murphy, who have been convicted of hacking phone networks and stealing millions of phone numbers. For this reason, they're not allowed to own phones.

But who owns the companies that sell cell phones to the FBI? That's where the third-party doctrine comes in. Under the third-party doctrine, third parties don't have to tell you about their business, but they do have to disclose to you the way they gather information on you.

'Queen Elizabeth II is dead': A tweet from the Royal Household's Twitter account, which has now been retweeted over 16,000 times and favourited by over 15,000

The tweet was sent out at 12.49pm, Sunday, July 20, shortly after the Queen was admitted to the hospital in London where she was put in a medically induced coma.

The tweet was accompanied by a picture of the Queen, who was pictured looking 'widespread' and 'unwell', with a message reading: 'The Queen is dead.'

It is yet to be confirmed whether the tweet was sent from Twitter itself, or was sent from a third-party app.

In a statement to MailOnline, a spokesman for Buckingham Palace said: 'The Queen is dead. She has died at 5.12pm this afternoon at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.'

At 12.50pm, the Royal Family released a statement on Twitter confirming the demise of the Queen.

The statement read: 'We can confirm that the Queen...has died.

Quick Walkthrough [ edit ]

Speak with Durnehviir at the Shrine. Travel to Helgen. Fight the raiders outside the city. Defend the Shrine.

Detailed Walkthrough [ edit ]

The Shrine [ edit ]

After arriving in Helgen, you will discover that a new bandit group, led by a Nord named Durnehviir, has taken over the Shrine. He wants you to kill two of his lieutenants, Arvak and Tolvak. He cannot be swayed by any attempts to persuade him, and the only way to end this conflict is to kill him.

The Bandit Leader [ edit ]

Arvak and Tolvak are located in the shrine's courtyard, just past the entrance. They are both carrying steel battleaxes and wearing light armor, while Arvak is carrying a leveled bow and some gold.

When you enter, a group of raiders will attack. It is possible to fight them without fighting Durnehviir. They are fairly weak, but they can kill you if you get caught in a surprise attack. There is a locked chest in the courtyard, which can only be opened by a key.

Inside the shrine [ edit ]

There are two ways to approach this matter:

Kill the two lieutenants, or let them live.

If you want to spare them, do so by killing Durnehviir.

Both of these are equally viable. You may kill them and loot their bodies. This will earn you the quest, but you will not be able to get any more gold from them or any other items. You can also kill them, and gain no reputation or experience for it, but you will not be able to get any of their gold or items either.

Or you can help them out by killing Durnehviir, and take the key. This will earn you a reputation increase with the Stormcloaks if you have the Light Foot perk, and a small amount of gold if you don't.

If you choose to spare them, simply enter the shrine and use the key on the locked chest. This will grant you access to the shrine and the shrine key. You can now go to the shrine and speak to Durnehviir to end the conflict.

A Retreat [ edit ]

If you do not want to kill Durnehviir, you can talk to Tolvak who is located in the same room. He is now a follower. If you speak to Tolvak, he will say, "You're right. I should've stayed out of this. But I'm not a killer. Not worth it, I tell you." He will then take you to Durnehviir.

Durnehviir [ edit ]

If you speak to Durnehviir, he will tell you, "You need to kill me. It's just what the temple needs." He will then ask you to retrieve the key from his body. He will give you the key and a second key, which you can use to open the locked chest. Durnehviir, being a follower, will not give you the second key even though you are a Thane.

Return to the Shrine [ edit ]

Inside the shrine, you will find Arvak and Tolvak dead. If you speak to him, he will say, "You're no worse than the rest. I should've just killed you." He will then take you to the chest to retrieve the final key. Once you have both keys, speak to Durnehviir again. This time, he will say, "I can't leave without them. I'll kill the rest."

Durnehviir [ edit ]

Durnehviir is now a follower who will follow you around. He will protect you, attack attackers, and defend the shrine. If you leave the shrine, Durnehviir will follow you to the entrance of Helgen and wait there for you to return. If you leave just before he can come, he will stay where he is and wait for you to return.

Notes [ edit ]

If you attack Durnehviir, he will become hostile.

According to a report by E.ON, Germany's biggest energy utility, the country's climate change legislation has been "significantly undermined" by the European Union's legal framework, which does not allow the country to introduce carbon pricing.

The report, which has been tabled in parliament, claims the European Union's (EU) climate change legislation is "prepared to open the door for a carbon market", in which electricity generated from coal and other fossil fuels would clearly be cheaper than that generated from renewables.

The EU's greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trading system (EU Emissions Trading System) is based on the idea of a carbon market, introduced by the then European Commission in 2007.


The European Union has had a carbon market since 2008, and earlier this year agreed a new framework for its implementation in which fossil fuels were no longer exempt from emissions trading.

However, the European Commission, which has responsibility for EU policy on climate change, says, on the basis of a Directive within the EU's executive branch, that the carbon market cannot be introduced.

"The Commission's position is that the market mechanism does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity," said the European Commission.

It claims that this means that the EU cannot introduce carbon pricing.

The Commission has also argued that the legislation is based on the principle of a "carbon tax", and this is against the principles of the EU's current law on climate change, which does not allow for the introduction of a carbon price.

"In fact, the EU Emissions Trading System is based on the market mechanism but the Commission's position is that the market mechanism does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity," said the European Commission.

The European Commission has also argued that the legislation is based on the market mechanism but the Commission's position is that the market mechanism does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity."

"The Commission has therefore concluded that the EU Emissions Trading System Regulation cannot be implemented in the way envisaged by the Commission," the European Commission added.

European Commission's position on climate change 'not certain'

However, two climate change ministers from the European Parliament's environment committee have already expressed their concern about the EU's position on carbon pricing.

"This letter shows that the EU's position on climate change is not certain. The lack of clarity is disappointing, as the EU was supposed to be leading on climate change by introducing a meaningful and binding carbon price," said the Parliament's committee on economic and monetary affairs.

The European Parliament's environment committee is currently holding a discussion on the EU's climate policy, under the title of "Climate change and the EU's energy transition".

The discussion will be held on 18 and 19 March.<|endoftext|>How the New York Times Caught the Trump-Russia Story Flat

Photo Credit: via YouTube

When the New York Times broke the news that Donald Trump Jr. had eagerly met with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 to receive dirt on Hillary Clinton, many were skeptical that the story would stick. Many were skeptical that the story would stick. But the Times did it anyway.

In this age of fake news, the Times' reporting — from reporter Adam Goldman — was accurate and thorough. It quoted a source close to the email chain, who said Trump Jr. "had been told" the lawyer was offering "sensitive information and documents that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father."

But then the Times got it wrong. The Times reported that the email chain was between Donald Trump Jr. and a music publicist named Rob Goldstone. The Times reported that Goldstone was an intermediary between Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer.

In fact, Goldstone was a publicist for a Russian pop star in New York.

SPONSORED

The Times did what many news organizations do when reporting on Russia: It relied on anonymous sources who get to choose their words, and who may not be entirely truthful themselves. The Times also often relies on anonymous sources to publish third-party material.

This was one of the many lessons we learned from the Times' botched Russia reporting. The lesson here is that after publishing articles about Russia that were false or misleading, the Times will likely have to make a significant correction.

For example, the Times published an article in July about Russia's election hacking that was based on an anonymous "intelligence official" who claimed "the U.S. intelligence agencies have been withholding material from President Trump fearing it could be used to blackmail him." The Times later amended the article, saying "the officials were not named in the article."

The Times' mistake in this case was in not going back and checking its reporting. It did not go back and check the Times' article with the full chain of emails. Instead, it relied on the anonymous sources, which the Times did not verify.

Best Answer: It's true. I'm a relatively new fan of the game, and I still love it. I've had it since the first game in 1993, and I've never really missed it. I do have a problem with the fact that it's always in my top three of all time games, and I always feel like I've missed out on the best games from the series. I love the soundtracks, and the movies. I also love the characters, and I love the characters I've played as. I love the main characters, and I love the characters I've played as. I love the characters that I've played as, and I love the characters I've played as. I love the series, and I love the game series, and I love the game series series.


I do like the story line, but I don't love it. I think it's not as good as the other games, and I think it's pretty silly. I like the dialog. I like the music. I like the art. I like the voice acting. I do like the voice acting, but I don't love it. I think the characters are pretty bland (oh, and the fact that the protagonist is a woman is just…odd), and I don't know why they made her a woman. I also like the fact that you can switch between male and female characters on the fly, but that really doesn't bother me. I know there are some female characters that I would like to play, but I don't think I'd want to play as a female character.


I like the fact that there's an online mode, but I don't love the fact that I have to pay for the game. I like that I can play the game online with my friends, but I don't love the fact that I have to pay for the game. I like the fact that it's a free game, but I don't love the fact that I have to pay for the game. I like the fact that there are online achievements, but I don't love the fact that I have to pay for them.


I don't think that any of these complaints are bad. I think that they're all things that I like about the game. I think that they're all things that I love about the game. I think that they're all things that I hate about the game. I have a problem with why I have to pay for it. I have a problem with the fact that there are online achievements.

The worst hurricane in recorded history has left at least 10 people dead in the Caribbean and the US has declared a state of emergency.

Hurricane Irma slammed into the Dominican Republic on Tuesday as a category 4 storm, and the storm could hit Florida as early as Thursday.

In the region, Irma reached Category 5 strength on Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said.

The hurricane has been downgraded to a Category 4 storm, but the storm is still moving at 26mph (42km/h) and is expected to make landfall on the southern coast of Cuba on Wednesday night.

The storm has caused at least 10 deaths so far, and a further six are still unaccounted for.

The hurricane has killed at least 12 people in the Caribbean with the most recent victim being a 17-year-old girl in the Dominican Republic.

The death toll is expected to rise.

The US has also declared a state of emergency, and has asked the National Guard to send the military to rescue people and restore power to homes and businesses.

"President Trump has directed government agencies to help as much as possible to evacuate and protect life, health, and property," the White House said in a statement.

"We will be mobilising federal, state and local resources to assist with the response," it said.

LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un has ordered his forces to prepare for a "new form" of warfare against the United States, the country's state news agency KCNA said on Monday, in a direct warning to Washington following the missile strike on Syria.

The report, carried by KCNA, said Kim had ordered an escalation of the Korean People's Army's (KPA) nuclear forces, and that the North's strategic force would make a "pre-emptive strike at the enemy in any place at any time".

"In case the enemy thinks that the situation is under control, then it is a declaration of war," KCNA quoted Kim as saying.

The report came just hours after the United States fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield, in the first direct military action by the Trump administration against the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Spring is in the air! I love that it's the perfect season to try new foods, and this dish is one of my favorites. It's very hearty and packed with flavor. Paired with a glass of cool water, it makes for a great weekend breakfast or dinner.

I've always enjoyed making my own dips and dressings, and this recipe is no exception. It's a great way to use up all those fresh garlic cloves you have in your fridge.

This recipe is easy and quick to make, and it only takes about 5 minutes to put together. This is the perfect side dish for a spring picnic or potluck.

MY LATEST VIDEOS

This dish is one of my favorites, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

To make Garlic Pesto & Black Bean Chili, you'll need:

2 tbsp. olive oil (or peanut oil)

1 large onion, chopped

1 large carrot, peeled and diced

1 red pepper, diced

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 14-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained

1 tbsp. fresh sage, chopped

1/2 tsp. chili powder

1/2 tsp. cumin

1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper

1 tsp. kosher salt

1/2 tsp. pepper

1 cup chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish

1 tbsp. diced fresh jalapeño pepper

To make the Garlic Pesto, place the olive oil in a small sauce pan and heat over medium-high heat. Add the onion, carrot, and pepper and cook until the vegetables are soft and the onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Then add the black beans, sage, chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 15 minutes.

Turn the heat off and let the soup cool slightly. Add the parsley, jalapeño, and salt and pepper to taste. Drain the black beans and add them to the soup. Serve immediately, or refrigerate until ready to use.

Tip: If you don't have parsley on hand, you can use any type of parsley. You'll just have to chop it up a little bit smaller.

Despite being crowned the world's best and most handsome man, London's Prince Harry has admitted he's not quite as handsome as he once was.

The 34-year-old, who has been announced as Britain's next Prince of Wales, told the Daily Star newspaper he hopes to fulfil his dreams of becoming an actor.

He said: "I did a lot of acting as a child, but I never did it seriously.

"I've always thought if I ever got the chance, I'd like to get into showbusiness – that's what interests me.

"To be honest, I don't think I look as good as I used to. I've lost a little bit of muscle.

"I've always had a bit of a paunch. Now I'm pretty skinny. I haven't had to do as many paint-jobs as I used to, although I've been known to get myself in a bit of a mess.

"I've got a bit of a runny nose now. I've got a bit of a scar on my cheekbone. I've got a bit of a gap between my teeth now."

The prince revealed he always thought of himself as a "model-type guy" but said he had to accept his "marketability".

He added: "I've got a bit of a computer in my hand, I'm not quite as good at maths as I used to be.

"I'm still the same type of guy as I was as a child. I'm a bit of a romantic – I'd like to be married and have a family.

"I think I'd like to do theatre, but I'm not sure I'm quite good at it. I've been doing it for a few years now, but I've never actually done anything serious.

"I wish I could have played the lead in a show. I'd love to be a leading man, but I've never been in a play."

Harry has been the subject of much fanfare since arriving in London from the US in 2012.

The prince, who is married to Meghan Markle, has not always been so approachable to the public.

He was initially seen as being distant from the public eye and his only public appearances had been to attend royal weddings.

We've made it a couple times, both times it was not as good as the first time. This time we improved on the recipe and made it a little healthier. We replaced the flour with a combination of graham, oat and coconut flour and used less butter and less sugar. The sweetener was only half of the original recipe. We also made some variations on the filling with some chocolate or chopped nuts.

For the filling:

2 cups pumpkin seeds

1/2 cup raisins

1/2 cup chopped walnuts

1/2 cup chopped peanuts

1/2 cup brown sugar

1 teaspoon cinnamon

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

For the crust:

1/2 cup coconut flour

1/2 cup oat flour

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon baking powder

1/4 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup coconut oil

1/2 cup melted coconut oil

1/2 cup chopped nuts

1/4 cup chopped chocolate

Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350F.

2. In a bowl combine the pumpkin seeds, raisins and walnuts. In a separate bowl, combine the peanuts, brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and baking powder. Stir well.

3. In a medium bowl, add the coconut flour, oat flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder and salt. Stir well.

4. In a small bowl, add the melted coconut oil and melted coconut oil. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir well.

5. Pour the dough into a greased 9-inch pie plate and press it down slightly.

6. Bake for 20 minutes or until the center is set. Let the pie cool for about 10 minutes before cutting into slices.

In a rare move, Judge John Bissett allowed Damien Hickey to remain free on bail, meaning he could leave the prison without being supervised by bail agents.

The judge said he was concerned at Hickey's lack of remorse and the apparent lack of any history of violence.

"I have no doubt that you had a mind to kill your wife and you are very sorry for what you have done, but your remorse is not sufficient," the judge said.

"I am not going to be swayed by the combination of remorse and a lack of history of violence. I don't think it's good enough.

"I don't think the evidence is there to allow you to be released on bail.

"You will be supervised by bail agents. I do not think that is a good idea," he said.

Hickey, 39, was found guilty of murdering his 39-year-old wife, Stephanie, in November 2011.

He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on December 8, 2012.

He was sentenced to life in prison with a non-parole period of 23 years and six months.

The judge said he was taking into account the fact Hickey was a father of two children.

He said Hickey had no history of violence and that he had no doubt he had been provoked.

"I have no doubt that you were provoked by your wife," he said.

"I am not going to be swayed by her final words. I am not going to be swayed by that."

He said he was also concerned about Hickey's risk of reoffending if released.

"The issue is not whether you are likely to reoffend, but rather what risks you pose if released," the judge said.

"There is nothing to suggest that you are likely to reoffend."

Hickey was arrested in Cairns after his wife's body was found.

He was charged with murder and was due to face Cairns Magistrates Court on March 14.

However, the State Government had refused to grant Hickey bail, saying the case was too sensitive.

A group of more than 200 protesters held a rally outside the court last night.

Hickey's lawyer said he pleaded guilty and was glad to have his day in court.<|endoftext|>The most beautiful ladies of the world, you're about to experience a very special and unique experience.

======================================== SAMPLE 432 ========================================
In the early afternoon of May 3, 1974, a 27-year-old woman named Lenore Zimmerman was walking home with her husband and two small children. She had just finished her shift at a grocery store and had gone home to put on her coat and put her children to bed. She was the mother of a little boy, who was a month shy of his first birthday.

That night, Zimmerman's husband found a woman and her children hiding in bed. She was crying and screaming, begging for her husband to kill her. She said she was being raped and that her husband was raping her with a gun.

Zimmerman grabbed the gun and fired at the woman and her children. She hit the little boy in the head, killing him.

The woman was shot three times; her children were shot five times.

The couple fled the scene, but Zimmerman's husband was apprehended the next day by police and later was convicted of first-degree murder.

Zimmerman, who was a single mother of two children at the time, was later awarded a $150,000 settlement from the city of Philadelphia for her injuries, which included a bullet lodged in her brain.

In 2009, the city of Philadelphia agreed to pay Zimmerman $1.2 million in a civil suit, but her attorney says that still isn't enough.

"The city is asking for $3 million, but it's only going to cost $18 million for the legal fees and I don't think that's even close to being enough," says attorney Robert Shapiro.

Shapiro says Zimmerman's family is still living in fear and that she has been unable to work since the shooting.

"She's still unable to walk down the street without being followed," says Shapiro.

Shapiro, who is also a police officer, says he is not doing this for money.

"I'm doing this for the integrity of our society," says Shapiro. "We need to make sure that these things don't happen again. I don't want her to have to go through the same experience that I went through."

The city of Philadelphia has agreed to pay Zimmerman $18 million for her injuries, for which Shapiro says he is fighting.

"We have to stop this," says Shapiro. "We can't let this happen again."<|endoftext|>I'm back to my usual routine, posting on the blog, sorting out a load of paperwork and getting busy with my new reading.

We're going to be releasing a new map called "Rise of the Black King". There's a reddit thread here, but I wanted to get a few more comments from you guys.

First off, we wanna know what you think about the theme. Would you like to see an expansion of the theme like Rise of the Red Dragon? (which is one of the maps that we released in 2008) or would you rather have "new" maps that are more different from the old ones?

Let's start with the definition of a basic income. I am using the American Heritage dictionary, which defines a basic income as:

a monthly payment from the government to a person or institution for life, paid in some unit of account

So according to this definition, basic income is a monthly payment from the government to anyone. It does not mean that everyone is getting a monthly payment from the government. It just means that everyone is getting a payment from the government, in some unit of account.

So I think we can see that basic income is a very powerful idea, because it allows people to benefit from the freedom of choice and the voluntary market without being under ever-increasing economic, social, cultural, and political control from the state.

However, in order for basic income to work, there are several conditions that need to be met.

The first condition is that the government needs to provide a payment from the government, in some unit of account. The second condition is that the government needs to be able to collect this payment. The third condition is that the government needs to be able to collect the payment from everyone.

The first condition is easy to fulfill. The government already collects taxes, so they do not need to collect basic income. The second condition is a bit more difficult to fulfill, since the government needs to collect the payment. It is a bit more difficult for the government to collect a payment from everyone. The government does not have the resources to collect a payment from everyone, but it can collect the payment from a small percentage of people, for a limited time.

The third condition is also difficult to fulfill. The amount of basic income needs to be small enough that you know that you will get a payment from the government, but large enough that even if you do not get a payment from the government, you will still be better off than you would be without basic income. The idea behind an unconditional basic income is that you will be better off than you would be if you did not receive basic income. The idea behind an unconditional basic income is that you will be better off than you would be if you did not receive basic income.

So to summarize, these conditions are easy to fulfill. The government can collect it from everyone, but the payment needs to be small enough that it does not seem like you are receiving it from the government, but large enough that you have a better life than you would have if you were on your own.

Now let's talk about the income that we would get from a universal basic income. Here is a rough estimate of the income that we would get from a universal basic income.

Income before taxes (excluding taxes for the existing social safety net) = $0

Taxes for current social safety net = $0

Taxes for basic income = $0

Total income = $1,000

(This is not an exact calculation, but it gives you an idea of what the income would be if you received a basic income)

I think that the first condition is easy to fulfill. The second condition is probably difficult to fulfill, but the third condition is easy to fulfill. The income that we would get from a universal basic income is only about $1,000 a year.

This makes sense, because the government collects taxes, so they do not need to collect basic income. It makes sense because the government can collect the tax from everyone, but the income that we would get from a universal basic income is only about $1,000 a year.

Now let's talk about the income that

Don't let the repeal of #Obamacare happen. Contact your Senators in opposition to the GOP's bill. https://t.co/oJWpY2l5l8 pic.twitter.com/CzPmEt8qGD — DNC (@DNC) July 18, 2017

The Senate's health care bill could be the first major legislative defeat for Democrats in seven years, and it would be their first shot at implementing the Affordable Care Act since President Barack Obama signed it into law in 2010. Since then, Democrats have struggled to find a way to make it more palatable to voters while trying to make good on their promise to keep it in place.

But after Trump's victory, Democrats have had to focus more on appealing to the base, and the health care bill represents a major opportunity to do so.

That's because public opinion of Obamacare has continued to slide, and in recent polls, Democrats are losing ground. A Morning Consult poll conducted in early June found that 49 percent of likely voters have an unfavorable view of Obamacare, while only 37 percent have a favorable view.

A Quinnipiac poll conducted in late June found that just 23 percent of likely voters have a favorable opinion of the health care bill, while 58 percent have an unfavorable view.

"The public doesn't like it and that's not going to change," Drew Altman, a Democratic strategist and president of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, told NBC News. "I think what's interesting is that the Democrats are still trying to explain why it's a good idea, but I don't think the public is buying their argument."

Altman added that the bill's approval rating may be driven by the unpopularity of Trump's plan.

"It's very hard to pass a health care bill in the first place. You need an unpopular president to approve it," he said. "Maybe the Republican Party is so disgusted with him that they're afraid they can't pass any health care bill."

Democrats have been unified in opposition to the Republican bill, and their opponents have been unified in opposition to them. The Senate's two most vocal opponents of the bill, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), are both still in the Senate, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is largely known for her progressive stances, has been at the forefront of the criticism.

In a statement released Thursday night, Sanders said that he would not support the GOP plan. "I intend to oppose the motion to proceed to the bill, and will oppose any effort to amend the bill in order to get it to my desk," he said. "It is simply unacceptable that Republicans would attempt to ram through a massive tax break for the rich and massive cuts to Medicaid without a guarantee that states will be able to afford to keep their promises to the people they represent."

On Sunday night, McCain issued a similar statement. "I will vote no on a motion to proceed to the bill unless it is amendments that improve the bill or are necessary to fix it," he said. "I have serious concerns about this proposal. I hope that Republicans will address my concerns."

In an interview with NBC News' Chuck Todd on Sunday, Warren said that McCain was "one of the few senators who I know is willing to stand up and say, 'I can't support this bill,'" and added that if the bill were to pass, "I think it will be a huge disaster."

"If it passes, it's a disaster for millions and millions of people, it's going to be a disaster for the middle class, it's going to be a disaster for seniors," she said. "I think people are going to see the ripples of this and they're going to say, 'I can't believe how big this is.'"

The push to stop the bill is likely to ramp up further as the Senate takes up its own version of the bill, which could include a number of changes to the bill's Medicaid provisions.

email: [email protected]<|endoftext|>(Natural News) If you're reading this website, you probably have all sorts of preconceived notions about a vegan lifestyle. You probably think the only people who would want to suffer through living without animal products are self-loathing, sick, diseased, callous, misogynistic, crazy, self-pitying, brainwashed, extremist, hateful, racist, and/or anti-Semitic.

You probably think vegans are crazy, selfish, unenlightened, anti-science, and anti-life.

You probably think vegans are really weird.

You probably think veganism is a cult.

You probably think vegans are delusional.

You probably think vegans are evil.

You probably think veganism is stupid and unhealthy.

You probably think veganism is pseudoscience.

You probably think veganism is just a fad.

You probably think veganism is just for hippies.

You probably think veganism is just for rich people.

You probably think veganism is just for a few rich people, or for animals.

You probably think veganism is just for people who hate animals.

You probably think veganism is just for people who don't believe in God.

You probably think veganism is just for people who want to control and manipulate animals.

You probably think veganism is just for people who want to weaken and destroy the animal rights movement.

But let's face facts…

Like it or not, at least 90 percent of all people are at least slightly susceptible to the pro-animal rights message. If you want to convince them, you will need to use their own words against them, and to do that, you need to use words that they don't understand.

To make matters even more confusing, you have to keep in mind that these same people are the ones who claim to be "all about empathy" and "all about compassion" when they're really looking for someone to blame for their own misery.

Many people are simply not educated on the vegan lifestyle. They're not going to believe you if you tell them that they're killing too many animals, when they've never heard the phrase "animal agriculture."

(Natural News has written about this before, and I'll repeat it here.)

If you are going to tell people that they're killing too many animals, you will need to find some way to rationalize that claim. That's because most people are not going to believe that you're killing animals because you're vegan.

So, here are some easy ways to convince the average vegan that you're doing the right thing.

(Note: I've also included some tips on how to convince the average non-vegan that you're vegan on the next page.)

1. Explain why eating meat is bad for you

I'm not going to lie to you, and I'm not going to tell you that eating meat is good for you. In fact, I'm not even going to tell you that eating meat is bad for you. In fact, I'm going to tell you that eating meat is bad for you. But I am going to tell you why it's bad for you.

The main reason meat is bad for you is because of the saturated fat, cholesterol, and antibiotics found in meat.

According to the Harvard School of Public Health, saturated fat is associated with heart disease, high cholesterol, and cancer.

Cholesterol is associated with a greater likelihood of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

Antibiotics are associated with bacterial resistance.

It's important to understand that the body can't process animal protein in the way it does plant protein. That's why it's so important to make sure that you get all of your nutrients from plant sources.

2. Explain why eating vegetables is good for you

Most people on the vegan diet eat meat and dairy products. So, it's not surprising that

I acquired these from a local pawn shop in New York City. They are a replacement for the battered CRW's I have been using. I was very happy when I received them.

The rubber is great, and the metal frame is nice. The belt is a little stiff for my tastes, but not so much that it will loosen up the belt loops. I know a lot of people like the metal frame, but for me it is just not what I was looking for.

I have a few others I have stored in the trunk of my car to be used in the future. I will probably choose the black ones over the color gray ones for some reason.

The sheriff's wife is under investigation by the Lee County Sheriff's Office for allegedly using her smartphone to send nude photos to a man she met on Craigslist.

According to a news release from the sheriff's office, Lee County Sheriff's Office Deputy Melissa Lynn Moreland sent the man a photo of herself on her phone at the Lee County Courthouse on Monday.

The sheriff's office said Moreland was still married to the sheriff when the couple met on the website.

During the investigation, the sheriff's office said Moreland admitted to sending the photos to the man.

"In addition to the photos, the Sheriff's Office is also conducting an investigation as to whether she let him photograph her genitals or altered the photos," said the release.

The sheriff's office said Moreland was placed on administrative leave "pending the outcome of this investigation."

Moreland posted $1,000 bond and was released.

She was scheduled to appear in court on April 11 for a probable cause hearing.<|endoftext|>How to Make It

I was surprised that so few people, myself included, took the time to read it. So I am reposting it here to show my respect for the author, and to encourage others
======================================== SAMPLE 437 ========================================
As the weather gets cooler and the days get shorter, more families are looking for a way to bring their children outdoors. We've all seen the photos of children sprinting through the air, and we've all been there.

But how can children learn to swim in the cold water without a lifeguard?

Here are a few tips for getting your child to the water safely.

1. Start early

The best way to get your child ready for the water is to start early.

"You can start the process of getting your child used to the water when they're younger. Get them out of the house, spend time with them and let them have some fun. Get them to enjoy it and they'll be much more likely to be able to go out in the cold water," says Marie Griffith, author of "Swimming & Your Child: A Guide to Safe Swimming," which was just named a New York Times bestseller.

2. Grab a bucket

A bucket can be a lifesaver when it comes to getting your child in the water. A bucket is a lot more convenient to use than a wading suit.

"Grab a bucket and get some ice, warm water and a towel," says Griffith. "Put the kid in the bucket, put the wading suit on and go."

3. Let them grab a swimsuit

If you're a parent, you can help your child get started by giving them a swimsuit.

"When they're older, you can get them a wading suit. But for the beginning, you can give them a swimsuit so they can get comfortable," Griffith says. "It can be from a swim store or online. I've seen people take a swimsuit to the pool and put it on a little girl or boy and they've been doing great."

4. Make sure they have a warm sweater

A warm sweater can help your child stay warm in the water.

"Once your child's used to the water, give them a warm sweater. It's the best thing you can give them," Griffith says. "You can give them a warm sweater for a swim or just give it as a gift."

5. Practice

You can help your child get used to the water by practicing several times.

"Start with a warm up. Have them on their back and let them get a feel for it," says Griffith. "After they get comfortable, teach them to crawl in the water. Then, you can start them in the water. You can start with the little ones and gradually work up to the swimming pool. Then you can start your child in the water. Then you can start the whole process up until they can go in the water."

6. Do it for fun

If you don't have a pool, you can still get your child started in the water.

"You can do it at home. Get them on a treadmill and let them run around in the pool," Griffith says. "It's really fun. You can practice swimming in the pool with the parents or just go out and practice on your own."

7. Do it with a friend

If you have a friend who is also a parent, you can swim together.

"Swim with your friends. You can do it in a family pool or at the park. It really helps get your child used to the water," Griffith says. "Then you can swim with your friend in the pool and you can practice swimming together."

8. Don't forget sunscreen

Sunscreen can help prevent sunburn and can give your child a boost of energy.

"You can always get sunscreen. If your child is very young, just use a little bit and use sunscreen in the water," Griffith says. "Remember to wear sunscreen and get plenty of water, too. The water is the best place to protect your skin."

9. Don't forget sunscreen on the go

You can leave sunscreen on your child's head when they're playing in the water.

"It's a great way to help them stay warm," Griffith says. "They can apply a little bit of sunscreen to their forehead and it will be much more effective than going out in the cold water alone."

10. Don't forget snacks

Fragrant snacks and cocoa are great for keeping your child's energy up.

"If they're going to be in the water, they need to have something to eat," says Griffith.

11. Use your child's favorite swimwear

A favorite swimsuit will help your child feel confident and comfortable swimming in the water.

"You can get them a swimsuit that you like and your child will feel comfortable," Griffith says. "You can get them a swimsuit that's really comfortable and you can even get them a swimsuit from a swim store. They won't

The latest issue of Pocket Gamer UK (via VG247) reveals that the next Nintendo Switch game is in development by the London-based studio Rare, and will be an action-adventure game.

"Rare has confirmed that it's working on a new game for the Nintendo Switch. We don't have any details at this time, but it's great to hear that the studio is working on something exciting," said VG247's Digital Foundry editor Ben Cousins. "A new Rare game is always welcome, as Nintendo is clearly keen to diversify its content, and it's not too long since we saw the studio's strategy on the PS4 with the launch of N++."

"It's always great to see a new take on an old IP," he continued. "I can't wait to see what Rare is cooking up. And while I've always enjoyed the Uncharted series, I'm eager to see what Rare's got cooking up for the Switch. I'm sure it's going to be something special."

A reveal trailer was also released by Rare, showing off the game's world and some of the action-based gameplay.

======================================== SAMPLE 440 ========================================
OTTAWA — Canadian job growth surged to its biggest monthly gain in a year as companies added more than 60,000 jobs in November, a sign the economy is on a solid path.

The unemployment rate eased to 6.6 per cent last month from 6.7 per cent in October, Statistics Canada reported on Friday.

A stronger-than-expected October employment gain is likely to fuel optimism that the Bank of Canada will hike interest rates again this year, although the central bank has not indicated whether it will raise rates in coming months.

"It's the best news we have had from Canada in a while," said Brian DePratto, chief economist for Toronto-Dominion Bank.

The job gains were broad-based and included a 13,000 increase in manufacturing jobs.

The drop in the unemployment rate was driven by an increase in full-time employment to 66,200, the highest since 2001, and a drop in part-time employment to 16,200.

Economists had expected the jobless rate to ease to 6.3 per cent in November, the lowest since September 2009, after the country posted its best employment growth in eight years last month.

The drop in the unemployment rate in the energy sector was "a strong indication that the world's second-largest oil exporter is keeping pace with the global economy," said Emanuella Enenajor, an economist with TD Economics.

The employment gains were broad-based and included gains in both full-time and part-time work. The number of jobs in agriculture also jumped to a record high.

"Employment increased at a more rapid pace in November than in any month since June 2014," Statistics Canada said.

The unemployment rate for young people aged 15 to 24 rose to 11.3 per cent, the highest level since the jobless rate began to edge up following the recession, Statistics Canada said.

However, the Bank of Canada has cautioned that the unemployment rate could rise as it weighs how many Canadians are entering the job market.

"The key question is whether the labour market will have markedly improved by the time the Bank's next policy decision is made in mid-2015," said Sal Guatieri, an economist with BMO Capital Markets.

The Bank of Canada has previously said that the unemployment rate is likely to rise as it weighs the overall size of the labour force.

A report from Canada's largest private-sector union found that job losses accelerated this year, with about 1,000 jobs lost in November alone, in a sign that the economy is still losing steam.

The Canadian Auto Workers said the latest numbers show "progress is being made, but not enough."

"The labour market has been improving for a long time, but we still have a long way to go to get back to full employment," said Chris Aylward, vice-president of employment and social development with the CAA.

The unemployment rate in Ontario jumped to 7 per cent from 6.9 per cent last month, while the rate in Quebec jumped to 7.4 per cent from 6.8 per cent.

The jobless rate in Saskatchewan edged down to 6.7 per cent from 6.8 per cent, while the rate in Alberta edged down to 8.1 per cent from 8.2 per cent.

Economists were expecting the unemployment rate to fall to 6.6 per cent next month.

The government reported the economy lost more than 11,000 jobs in September, bringing the total number of jobs lost to 23,100, although the jobless rate has since fallen by 0.3 percentage points to 6.7 per cent.

Last month, Statistics Canada also revised the August numbers upward to show that the economy gained 29,400 jobs, while the unemployment rate fell to 6.6 per cent from 6.7 per cent.

On Friday, the bank's governor, Stephen Poloz, stayed the course that the bank is unlikely to raise interest rates until late 2015.

"The risks to the outlook for the labour market remain tilted to the downside," he said in a statement.

"This is, therefore, another message to the Canadian economy that labour market slack remains in place."

Economists had expected the jobless rate to fall to 6.3 per cent.

Under such an agreement, countries would set emissions targets and then work on them in conjunction with one another.

This story originally appeared on The Conversation.

In the months leading up to this year's NHL draft, it was clear that the Montreal Canadiens were looking for a new face as the team's captain.

They could not find it, however, and that led to the team taping a video of its captain to the wall of their dressing room. It was a publicity stunt, but it worked, and as a result, the Canadiens were able to find their next captain.

If you're looking for the NHL's best captains, however, you might look elsewhere. It turns out that the players who lead the league in leadership are often not the players with the most experience in the NHL.

This study looks at captains across the NHL, and how they compare to the players who lead other teams. The study looked at a total of 408 captains in the 2000-01 through 2013-14 seasons.

Leadership is a tough thing to measure accurately, but there are a couple of ways that we can measure it. One way is to look at a player's performance compared to his teammates. If a player is a better player than his teammates, he's a better leader.

If a player has a certain level of success with a particular team, he's a better leader.

The other way to measure leadership is by looking at the players who lead other teams. If one of the teams that a player leads is better than the team that he currently leads, he's a better leader.

So, the idea is to look at captains and captains-to-be, look at their performances over the previous couple of seasons, and see if they're better than the players who are currently leading their teams.

The researchers used two tests to see if captains had a higher or lower level of leadership compared to the players they were currently leading. First, they looked at how well a captain performed while his team was winning, and then they looked at how well he performed when his team was losing.

It turned out that captains were better leaders when their teams were winning, when their teams were losing, and when their teams were tied.

The Big Three

The team with the highest win percentage was the Dallas Stars, followed by the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs. The team with the lowest win percentage was the Detroit Red Wings, followed by the Pittsburgh Penguins and New York Rangers.

The two teams with the highest win percentage were the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs. The two teams with the lowest win percentage were the Dallas Stars and the Montreal Canadiens.

The team with the highest average goals scored per game was the Montreal Canadiens, followed by the Dallas Stars and the Toronto Maple Leafs. The team with the lowest average goals scored per game was the Pittsburgh Penguins and the New York Rangers.

Cambodian police said Thursday that a Chinese man whose body was found in the jungle near Bangkok has been identified as the missing businessman who disappeared in the South China Sea last month.

The man was identified by his family as Zheng Zhaohui, who disappeared on April 15 while on a fishing trip in the body of a 40-year-old Chinese woman, state-run Global Times reported.

He was later found by Thai fishermen in a remote part of the Gulf of Thailand, far from where he had been last seen.

"We believe he was a victim of foul play, but we are still investigating," a police official, who asked not to be named, told AFP.

The official said the woman's body was found by accident and the man's in a bad condition due to starvation.

Zheng, a father of three, was last seen in Cambodia on April 15.

He was reportedly last seen in a taxi with a Chinese woman who was not his wife, the Associated Press reported.

The Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh confirmed to AFP on Thursday that he had entered their country on March 29 and was reported missing on April 15.<|endoftext|>A federal judge in Seattle on Tuesday ordered the federal government to pay $18 billion to the families of 9/11 victims and their families in a lawsuit over the government's secretive use of so-called "black site" prisons.

U.S. District Judge Richard Jones said the government must pay all proceeds from the lawsuit filed last year on behalf of the families of those killed in the Sept. 11 attacks, the Associated Press reported.

Jones ruled that the families are entitled to $4 million from the government's use of the prisons where the 678 classified detainees were held after the attacks.

The U.S. Department of Justice had argued that the families had no standing to sue because they're not U.S. citizens, although they are U.S. citizens.

The families' attorney, Shannon Liss-Riordan, said she was "thrilled" with the decision.

"Our clients suffered horrific losses at the hands of terrorists who sought to do us harm. A disaster of this magnitude cannot be allowed to happen again," she said. "We are grateful to Judge Jones for providing us with the opportunity to seek justice for their loved ones in a federal court."

The exact date the DOJ will start paying out the money to the families has not been determined, the AP reported.

The DOJ received a court order requiring it to pay the $18 billion by Tuesday, according to AP.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which was filed last June, include the families of two men who died in the Sept. 11 attacks, and families of two other victims who died in separate incidents.<|endoftext|>A new study from the University of California, Berkeley, has found a link between the brain's reward circuitry and marijuana use.

The study, published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, found that marijuana use was associated with changes in the structure of the brain's reward system. The study also found that the hippocampus, a region of the brain responsible for learning and memory, was significantly larger in people with a history of marijuana use.

The study, called "Long-Term Effects of Marijuana on the Hippocampus and Hippocampal-Substantia Lateralis Connectivity," follows a 2014 study from the same group of researchers, which found that a history of marijuana use is associated with impaired learning and memory.

"It's likely that the hippocampus is a target for cannabis-induced cognitive impairments in some people," said the study's senior author, Dr. Ravi Somah, a professor of psychiatry at UC Berkeley and director of the Neuropsychopharmacology Unit at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. "But it may not be all of them."

Somah added that cannabis use might have additional consequences for certain areas of the brain, and that the studies are still preliminary and need to be replicated.

In the new study, the researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to scan the brains of 15 young adults, all of whom had a history of marijuana use. They found that the hippocampus was significantly larger in people with a history of marijuana use - 69 percent larger in some cases - compared to people without a history of marijuana use.

The study also found that the size of the hippocampus was positively associated with marijuana use over the past month.

The structure of the brain's reward system is important for reward processing, Somah said. "That reward system is involved in things like drug reward, and it's a useful anatomy for understanding the mechanisms by which marijuana uses might affect reward," he said.

The previous study found that the hippocampus was smaller in people with a history of marijuana use, but it did not find a direct relationship between the size of the hippocampus and other brain regions.

The first, and most common, is "exercise and reinforcement". This is when you try to reduce your stress, using tools like music, food, or exercise. The goal is to become more efficient, and not used to stress.

The second is "training" where you use the tools of the field to increase your effectiveness.

The difference is subtle, but powerful. The first is emotional, and the second is intellectual.

In the end, we all want the best for ourselves and others. If you want to become a better coach, you have to be emotionally and intellectually engaged with the task.

This is why I love the job of a trainer. I get to be social, and connect with people. I get to help people to improve themselves. I get to learn things I never thought I would.

This is why I want to share my journey as a personal trainer. This is the story of how I became a personal trainer, and what I've learned along the way.

The first step to becoming a personal trainer is to ask yourself these questions:

What am I passionate about?

What am I good at?

What am I good at?

Now, that's a lot of questions. In reality, we usually have a bottom-up approach to our training. We start with a question, and then do the best we can to answer it. But the most important question is:

What am I passionate about?

This is the most basic question you can ask yourself. It is what motivates you. It is what makes you go to the gym. And it is what inspires you to continue.

If you don't know what you are passionate about, you don't know what you need to do.

This is the most basic question you can ask yourself.

The reason this question is so hard to answer is because your answer will be different from person to person.

Some people have one or two passions. They don't have many interests outside of their work, and they do it because it is a job.

My friend, Ryan, for example, is a passionate cyclist. He loves cycling. He can't imagine a day without it.

But he was working as a software engineer for a large company. He decided to quit to get back to being a cyclist.

Then I asked him.

"What do you want to work on and how do you want to do it?"

He said he wanted to be a strength coach. He wanted to help cyclists learn how to keep their muscles strong. He wanted to be a teacher, and he wanted to help change the way people were thinking about weight training.

I asked Ryan what he thought about it.

"I'm not sure I want to be a strength coach. I'm just a friend of a friend."

Ryan is passionate about cycling. He loves it. He loves being a cyclist. But he didn't have any passion for being a strength coach.

My friend Ryan didn't have any passion for being a strength coach.

"Babylon's great city was built in the time of Solomon, and its walls were made of brass. Its gates were of iron and its gates were of iron." -- Book of Judges, 2 Kings 24:25

The walls of Babylon--the ancient capital of ancient Mesopotamia--are well-known to all who have studied the history of the region.

Yet the story of how the city was built has often been misunderstood or distorted.

The following accounts, taken from the Bible, of the construction of the city of Babylon, are as accurate as we are able to make them.

THE BUILDING OF BABYLON

JOSEPH'S EXPLORATION

Josiah's Report on the Construction of the City of Babylon

The city of Babylon was built in the time of Solomon, at a time when Israel was in captivity.

The name of the city is not given in the Bible, but it is supposed that the original name of the city was Hormah which means "the city of God." (1 Kings 17:26)

Josiah, a king of Judah, was sent by the Persian king Darius the Great to repair the city. He had already been sent to Babylon by the king of Persia to repair the damage caused by the Assyrian war of conquest. (2 Kings 17:24)

Josiah began his work in the temple at Pella, the capital of Judah. He returned to the temple at Babylon and set up a standard of national pride by erecting a golden statue of himself in front of the temple. (2 Kings 20:21)

He also built another temple at Babylon, and the king ordered that all the priests and priestsesses should live and work in the temple at Babylon. (2 Kings 20:23)

Josiah then returned to Jerusalem and continued his work. Joseph, a young man of noble birth, was appointed to be the chief administrator of the temple and the royal treasury.

In those days there were no strong or rich men in Jerusalem. Joseph became wealthy because he bought and sold the people's goods in the market place. (Exodus 2:27)

Joseph developed a reputation for honesty and integrity. (Exodus 3:12)

He took the profits of these transactions and used them to build the temple at Jerusalem. (Exodus 3:15)

Joseph also built another temple at Babylon, and the king ordered that all the priests and priestsesses should live and work in the temple at Babylon. (2 Kings 20:24)

On the east side of the temple he built the Double Gate. (Exodus 3:18)

In order to promote peace and harmony in the city he built a dam across the River Jordan and built a canal that led to the beautiful city of Jericho. (Numbers 19:26)

In the city of Babylon he built to the east of the temple the Third Gate. (Numbers 19:27)

He also built another temple at Babylon, and the king ordered that all the priests and priestsesses should live and work in the temple at Babylon. (2 Kings 20:23)

JOSIAH'S REPORT ON THE BUILDING OF BABYLON

The story of the building of the city of Babylon is told in two books by Joseph, the grandson of Heli, a prophet of the nation of Judah.

The first of these books is called the Book of Josiah. (1 Kings 17:25,26)

Josiah was a descendant of Heli. (2 Kings 16:18)

The city of Babylon had become a symbol of the supremacy of a foreign king.

Babylon was at a low ebb in its power.

The people of Israel were in captivity in Babylon. (Numbers 19:26-27)

The city of Babylon had become a symbol of the supremacy of a foreign king.

In order to increase the power of the Babylonian king, Josiah began to build a great temple at Jerusalem.

Babylon was at a low ebb in its power.

The people of Israel were in captivity in Babylon.

Josiah began to build a great temple at Jerusalem.

JOSIAH'S REPORT ON THE TRIAL OF THE BABYLONIANS BEFORE THE ARCHANGELS

The story of the trial of the Babylonians before the archangels is given in two books by Joseph, the grandson of Heli, a prophet of the nation of Judah.

The first of these books is called the Book of Josiah. (1 Kings 17:26,27)

Josiah was a descendant of Heli. (2 Kings 16:18)

The researchers were interested in finding out whether the feeling of being buzzed or drunk might influence people's food intake. On the other hand, if people are more relaxed, they are less likely to eat.

Researchers at the University of Baltimore's Department of Psychology, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, conducted two experiments to test this theory.

The first experiment showed that people who were buzzed had more calories consumed over the course of several hours than those who were sober.

The second experiment looked at whether people's state of being relaxed made them less likely to eat more.

In both experiments, the researchers found that when people were buzzed, they were more likely to eat more calories than when sober.

"We expected that people would eat more, but we were surprised that we found a 'dose response' effect, in which the effect wore off over time," said study author Dr. Amy Wrzesniewski, an associate professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Baltimore.

"This suggests that people can have a pre-drinks buzz, which might cause them to eat more and become more satisfied and distracted," she said.

These findings are based on a study of 152 people, some of whom were in the study for a month and others for three weeks.

The effect was most pronounced when subjects were in an enjoyable mood, and when they were in a state of high arousal (liking or wanting to engage in a task that involved exertion).

"These results suggest that the buzz experienced during a drink is linked to increased calorie intake, but that the effect wears off within a few hours," said study author Dr. Dustin Lambert, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.

"These results are consistent with the idea that people who are buzzed are more likely to engage in a task that involves physical exertion or engage in their favorite activity," he said. "On the other hand, people who are relaxed may eat more because they are more concerned about their weight."

In the first experiment, specifically designed to test the theory, a group of participants -- some of whom were in an enjoyable mood and others who were in a high-arousal state -- were able to consume up to 2,000 calories over the course of several hours. The researchers found that the group who was high on positive emotions, such as enjoyment, were able to maintain this level of intake for an extended period of time.

In the second experiment, the participants were given three different types of tasks: a game of Monopoly, a word search game and a game of "Angry Birds." Participants who were high on positive emotions were able to complete the tasks for three hours.

"Generally, people who are high on positive emotions are more likely to be active, which could lead them to consume more calories," said study lead author Dr. Steven O'Keefe, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.

"We also found that people who are high on positive emotions are more likely to engage in a task that involves physical exertion, which could lead them to consume more calories," O'Keefe said.

In the second experiment, the researchers showed the participants a series of images that were either positive or negative, and asked them to rate each image on a scale where "very negative" means "very little" and "very positive" means "very much."

The researchers also asked participants to rate the intensity of the images, and they found that those who were high on positive emotions were more likely to rate negative images as "very negative" and "very positive."

"The reason for this is that people who are high on positive emotions are more likely to feel satisfied with their lives and are more likely to have positive attitudes about the world and people," O'Keefe said.

"These findings suggest that when people are high on positive emotions, they are more likely to engage in a task that involves physical exertion,

Ultimate Disc Golf is the world's fastest growing sport, and the first disc golf disc to be certified as a non-golfing sport. Play with your friends and family in over 80 countries around the world. Play for fun or compete with friends in the ultimate disc golf world championship.

Ultimate Frisbee is a non-golfing sport that is played on a disc. Unlike traditional sports, you don't have to worry about wearing cleats or a jersey. All you need is a disc and a pair of shoes. The disc that we play is made for Ultimate Frisbee. It is made of a high-density polyethylene and is light weight (1.5 oz.). It is 5 3/4 inches in diameter and the weight varies depending on the size of the disc. The disc will fly over 300 yards.

The Ultimate Disc Golf game is similar to disc golf. Yes, you can play disc golf with a frisbee. But, ultimate disc golf is played faster than disc golf. The rules of Ultimate Disc Golf are similar to those of disc golf.

The Ultimate Disc Golf game is also similar to golf. You can enjoy Ultimate Disc Golf in any weather. In fact, Ultimate Disc Golf was created in a golf course in Utah because it is a better weather sport.

Ultimate Disc Golf is played in 85 countries around the world. In the United States, the most popular disc golf course is in Oakland, Calif. (52,000 members).

Ultimate Disc Golf has become an international sport, and the sport has been featured on television programs such as "The Ultimate Fighter" and "Dancing with the Stars."

However, the ultimate disc golf game is not for everyone to play. Ultimate Frisbee is a non-golfing sport that can be considered as a sport. The rules of Ultimate Disc Golf are similar to those of non-golfing sports. However, Ultimate Frisbee is played faster and the players are not allowed to wear cleats or jerseys.

In the past, Ultimate Frisbee was only played on the streets. However, the sport has now become more popular. On a typical Friday night, there are at least 50 people playing Ultimate Frisbee.

Ultimate Frisbee is played by using a disc, which is held in the hand. You must hold the disc with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand and the middle finger of the left hand. The disc must be held in a straight line until it is released.

As you can see, Ultimate Frisbee is very different from traditional football, baseball and basketball.

There are no team names that are called out during the game. The players are called out by the thrower and you are called out by the receivers.

There are no penalties for unnecessary contact, roughness, roughing the passer, or rougher play. You can't even use your hands or feet to block the ball.

In Ultimate Disc Golf, the thrower is the smartest and the smartest player is the disc. In Ultimate Disc Golf, the thrower is the disc. The disc is called a disc because it is propelled from the hand.

In Ultimate Disc Golf, you must control the disc in order to catch it. To throw the disc, you must be in control of the disc at all times. You can't throw the disc when you are in the middle of a wind, or when the wind is blowing.

In Ultimate Disc Golf, you must use your eyes, hands, body and feet to catch the disc. To control the disc, you must use your hands and feet.

In Ultimate Disc Golf, you can't throw the disc faster than 100 mph.

In Ultimate Disc Golf, you can't play if you are older than 18 years old.

In Ultimate Disc Golf, you can't hit the disc more than 14 times.

In Ultimate Disc Golf, you can't take your hands off the disc during play.

In Ultimate Disc Golf, you can't use your hands to hold the disc.

A former FBI official with knowledge of the investigation says that special counsel Mueller's team is investigating whether Trump tried to obstruct justice in his dealings with former FBI director James Comey.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was not clear whether the investigation was still active or whether Mueller had opened a grand jury.

"It's clear that the special counsel's investigation is looking into whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts to interfere with the election," the person said.

The person declined to identify the specific point of focus or say when the investigation is looking into the matter.

The revelation is the latest twist in Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, which has embroiled the president in controversy over his firing of Comey and his decision to turn over to the White House his memo detailing a conversation between him and the president in which the president urged him to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Trump has repeatedly denied that he tried to obstruct justice, and his attorney, Marc Kasowitz, said during a news conference last week that the president was not under investigation.

The revelation could further complicate Trump's efforts to defend himself in the Russia probe.

The president has repeatedly said he did not ask Comey for his loyalty. The question of Comey's commitment to the FBI has become central to Mueller's investigation.

The former official said that Comey's refusal to pledge his loyalty to Trump within a set window of time, for example, could be a matter of concern to Mueller.

"That would be the most glaring example," the person said.

The former official also said that Mueller's team is closely monitoring any financial ties between Trump associates and Russia.

"The nexus between the campaign and Russia right now is money," the person said. "Anybody who is trying to connect that directly to obstruction of justice is going to have a hard time."

Mueller, a former FBI director, was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to serve as special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, including possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia. He was confirmed by the Senate in May.

Trump has called the investigation into Russia's interference "the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history" and has repeatedly called the Russia investigation a "taxpayer funded charade."

The Senate intelligence committee said last week that it had established an investigative subcommittee to determine whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the campaign.

Mueller's team has also assembled a team of investigators to review documents and interview witnesses as part of its investigation, according to the person.

The campaign, called #In-N-Out, aims to increase the number of women in STEM fields by getting them to try out new products.

It also helps make sure that companies are recruiting the right kind of women and encouraging them to apply for the roles they want.

The challenge is to offer women products and services that are fast, easy, easy to use and don't require special training.

Some of the products include burgers, fries, shakes, and fast food sandwiches.

The companies involved are Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter and Yahoo.

"In the past, women have been discouraged from entering technical fields because they were discouraged by the lack of job opportunities," said Tracy Chou, director of technology, media and entertainment at In-N-Out Burger.

"Women in tech are still under-represented in the workforce, but we feel strongly that by offering products and services that are simple, accessible and hard to resist, we can inspire more women to enter the fields."

The campaign is being run in collaboration with the National Science Foundation.

Each company is also encouraging their employees to take on the challenge.

"We're encouraging our employees to show the world what their workplace can be, and let the chips fall where they may," said Facebook.

"We're encouraging our employees to show the world what their workplace can be, and let the chips fall where they may."

The new gender gap in the workforce is one of the most pressing issues facing the country.

According to a 2009 report from the National Science Foundation, women in the US are under-represented in STEM careers.

According to the report, women make up about a third of all students who pursue a science, technology, engineering or math-related degree.

High school football player Eric Johnson is charged with aggravated assault and stalking. He's charged with stalking his ex-girlfriend in a way that led to her getting arrested, and now Johnson is in prison.

A judge in Canton, Ohio, cleared Johnson of the charges Friday, saying there was no evidence to show a crime had occurred.

His ex-girlfriend, Kelsey Johnson, was arrested Sept. 26 after a domestic incident at their home. Police said Kelsey Johnson allegedly threatened her ex-boyfriend with a knife and told him to "get out of the house" if he called the police.

Police said after Kelsey Johnson was arrested, she texted her ex-boyfriend and asked him to call 911. He did, and she was arrested.

Eric Johnson, who's in jail, was arrested several hours later after police said he tried to stop a police officer who was trying to question Kelsey Johnson.

Johnson's attorney, Michael DeWolf, said Kelsey Johnson had tried to call the police before. She did it twice before, and she did it again after Johnson called her, DeWolf said in a statement.

"This arrest was a continuation of a longstanding pattern of harassment by Eric Johnson against his ex-girlfriend," DeWolf said. "He has been arrested numerous times for domestic violence and stalking. Yet he has never been arrested for the acts of which he was charged today."

Kelsey Johnson has been released from jail on $5,000 bond. She's scheduled for a preliminary hearing next month.

The senators, led by Republican Mark Kirk of Illinois, say they're looking into proposals that would allow foreign governments to purchase cyber warfare capabilities from U.S. companies without the restrictions that currently apply. They also want to see the government make it easier for U.S. companies to sell cyber weapons, a possibility that has been raised as part of a wide-ranging debate over the future of cyber warfare.

"The United States is in a unique position to lead in an area where there are no uniform standards within the international community. We should not be held back by the U.S. government's outdated policies," Kirk and his colleagues said in the letter to Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.

The Obama administration has a history of being reluctant to allow foreign governments to purchase cyber weapons from U.S. companies. A certain amount of technology is considered "critical infrastructure," according to the Department of Homeland Security, giving the government the authority to regulate the sale of such technologies.

But some lawmakers, including Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), a long-time supporter of legislation that would allow the sale of U.S. cyber weapons to foreign governments, have suggested that the Obama administration should ease restrictions on the export of such weapons. Lieu has introduced a bill that would do just that.

"The United States should not be the only country that can defend the Internet against foreign hackers," Lieu said in a statement to The Intercept. "The U.S. government should be able to export the necessary capabilities to enable its allies and partners to defend against cyberattacks."

The letter was signed by Sens. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

The senators also appear to be interested in a proposal from the House set to be considered by the House Rules Committee this week that would allow companies to sell cyber weapons without requiring them to register as munitions exports, a requirement that has been in place since the Clinton administration.

The move comes as the Obama administration is considering a broad set of proposals intended to regulate the sale of cyber weapons to foreign governments. In June, the White House released a two-page proposal that included a number of proposals to allow the sale of cyber warfare capabilities to foreign governments with an eye toward making it easier for companies to sell such capabilities. The proposal would also allow certain foreign governments to buy U.S. cyber weapons without having to register as munitions exporters, as currently required.

When you're raising your little ones, you want to make sure they're healthy. At the same time, you want them to be safe and comfortable. There are many games for this, but the one I've chosen is one of my favorites: Carcassonne.

Carcassonne is a game of building a medieval village from a starting base. The town is your domain. You distribute resources and work out your strategy for the next turn. The more resources you have, the more powerful your town. The more powerful your town, the more danger you face. The more danger you face, the more units you can build, and the more options you have to interact with the world.

Carcassonne is a lot like a board game, and it shares a lot of similarities. It's filled with tiles, and you can place your own pieces as well as those of other players. It's also full of small pieces, like the little leprechauns, rabbits, and other random things that you can build.

In Carcassonne, the player who has the most points at the end of the game is the winner. But there's a slight twist. If you can't place your pieces on a particular tile, you lose. In other words, you can't always just build a road to your opponent's town. It's a little bit like poker, but with Carcassonne, you can bet your life on the dice.

The game is also fairly easy to teach. I've played with my kids and they've played with their friends. They've all understood the rules, and they've all enjoyed playing.

Here's a video of me demonstrating Carcassonne:

I've written a few blog posts about Carcassonne, including a two-part series about the tiles (you can see those here and here). I also created a video series here.

To learn more about Carcassonne, here's my review of the original Carcassonne.

The mural depicts a '60s-era man in a white suit, complete with hat and bowtie. The man is holding a telephone to his ear, and a caption on the wall reads: "I am the chief of police." The man is holding a gun to his head, and a caption on the wall reads: "I am the sheriff."

The mural was painted after a man named Brian Buckner drove by the restaurant one day and noticed it.

"I was looking out the window, and I saw this weird looking man here in the restaurant, so I stopped and I said, 'Hey, what's going on here?' He said, 'That's my sign.' And I said, 'Oh, that's a good sign.'"

The man was the manager of Twin Peaks, and he had been painting the mural for over a year. He and his staff spent hours paint-brushing the mural over, and the only thing left behind was the wall.

"It was a beautiful piece," Buckner said. "It was very beautiful. This is what I grew up on, and I didn't want it to go away."

Buckner didn't want to just paint over the mural, though. He wanted to add something more important to the place.

"I thought it would be really cool if I could put a plaque or a sign to tell you what Twin Peaks is, why we're here, and what we're all about," Buckner said. The plaque is still in place, and the sign was installed on the wall in the middle of the restaurant's dining room.

The mural was installed in 1979, in honor of Brian Buckner's father, who was employed at Twin Peaks when it was first established in 1957. Brian Buckner said his father was a very proud man — and he's still proud of the mural.

"It was a sign of how far our town had come, and the fact that we're still here," Buckner said. "It's not going anywhere. We've got a bright future here."

Buckner has been a Twin Peaks employee for over 20 years, and he said the restaurant is a community that's been very good to him. He said he's been to the Twin Peaks restaurant on almost every weekend for the past 20 years, and he's been a frequent customer of the shop.

"I love this place," Buckner said. "I love it, and I love it, and I love it."

As for the mural, Buckner said it's

Today, it is a rogue state, one that was a major player in the Ukraine crisis, and it holds onto a nuclear arsenal. That's why it's so problematic that the Trump administration has begun to cozy up to Vladimir Putin. It's a mistake that could leave the U.S. beyond the reach of the international community.

Understanding the current situation is essential to understanding the present situation. It's also why what little we know about the administration's approach to Russia is so frightening.

The United States has a decades-long, multi-layered, and highly complicated relationship with Russia. The 1990s saw the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the U.S. and Russia began to rebuild their relationship. The end of the Cold War brought the two nations closer, but also threw the U.S. and Russia into conflict over the future of the former Soviet Republics. Since then, the U.S. has used limited means to punish Russia for its actions, ranging from sanctions to the expulsion of Russia's diplomats.

Advertisement

Over the past few years, U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin have engaged in a series of talks to try to resolve the conflict, but it's been a struggle. The U.S. wants Russia to cut its support for Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria and Russian ally. The Russians want the U.S. to stop supporting rebels fighting Assad. The U.S. wants to prevent more attacks from the Islamic State, but also wants to support the Syrian government. The U.S. wants to prevent Russia from extending its reach into Ukraine and the Baltic States. The Russians want to keep Ukraine from turning into a failed state and to reduce tensions in the Baltics.

The United States' failed attempts to engage Russia have contributed to the current state of affairs.

Russia's behavior in Ukraine has been responsible for the current state of affairs. The U.S. and its European allies pushed the country around for years, creating a crisis in which Russia's economy was decimated and Russian citizens were forced to flee for their lives. When Trump began his campaign, he seemed to have an interest in improving relations with Russia. He called for a friendly foreign policy toward Russia, and was supportive of NATO. He seemed more comfortable getting along with Putin, however, and he spoke favorably of Putin's leadership.

But that changed when the U.S. discovered that Russia had been interfering in the 2016 election. The U.S. intelligence community concluded that Russian intelligence had hacked the emails of senior Democrats, and that Russia leaked the information through WikiLeaks to help Trump win the election. Trump has repeatedly denied that Russia was behind the hack, and the U.S. intelligence community has said that it has no evidence that Russia interfered with the election.

Trump's campaign has been inconsistent in its response to the alleged Russian hacking. In September,

The Big East won't be able to survive a two-year hiatus without the Cardinals.

A pair of new reports will reveal the future of the Big East, and the possible loss of Louisville.

The Big East won't be able to survive a two-year hiatus without the Cardinals.

The Big East won't be able to survive a two-year hiatus without the Cardinals.

Two new reports, released this week, show the Big East on the brink of collapse.

The Big East's future is in doubt after uncertainty about when and if Louisville will leave the conference.

The league is in danger of losing its only major power player.

That's a terrible thing for so many reasons, but perhaps foremost because the Big East is in danger of being removed from the list of national power conferences.

Both reports, from The Big East's annual survey of athletics directors, indicate the conference will lose the final two schools in its current 22-team fold.

It all comes down to Louisville and West Virginia.

Louisville still is a year away from a decision on its future, but a decision is expected in the next two weeks.

Meanwhile, the Big East is not expected to lose West Virginia, but the school is expected to make a decision in the next few weeks about its future.

The Big East is in the midst of a major coaching change, as Pitt's James Franklin will take over the Mountaineers.

That change will likely be enough to give the Big East a serious scare, even though the conference will probably survive the loss of Louisville.

The Big East is in financial trouble.

The Big East has been in the red for several years, and according to the new reports, the conference has $5.2 million in debt and a projected deficit of $10 million for the fiscal year beginning July 1.

When Will Louisville Leave?

There's speculation that Louisville might leave the Big East.

The real question is whether the Cardinals will leave before July 1, or whether they will decide to leave a few weeks later.

The Big East could lose the Cardinals this summer, but their decision is far from certain.

What is clear, though, is that the Big East will be in trouble without Louisville.

The Big East has been without a major power player for more than a year, and the fact Louisville is expected to make a decision in the next few weeks means the Big East might not be able to survive the loss of Louisville.

There's no question the Big East is in a crisis, and that will not change if Louisville leaves.

It's possible that Louisville leaves, but it's also possible the Cardinals stay.

Another Big East school, Rutgers, has also looked at leaving the conference, but the school has yet to make a final decision.

"The rover is currently about a meter away from the 'target' location, where a sampling system was placed. The rover is also about a meter away from the rock that the system is on."

The 'Spoofing' of the Bible by Phil Robertson

When it comes to Christianity, it's easy to be a snob about it if you're not a Christian.

The Bible is a megaphone providing an instantaneous voice for the voice of God. It is often shared through scriptures, stories and parables. But what if we're the ones who snub that megaphone?

Freedom of religion is enshrined in the Constitution; the Bible is not. This means that any church or faith can change the Bible in an instant by making a few changes to the text. That's not right.

This is the main reason why it's such a great idea for the GOP to nominate someone who has a track record of changing the Bible.

The North Carolina pastor who made headlines recently for making a flippant comment about homosexuality was also a man who changed the Bible. He did so by changing the words of the Bible to fit his own personal views.

The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life recently released a report about the "spoofing" of the Bible. The phrase is used by some Christians to describe the way in which a church can change the Bible to fit their own beliefs.

The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life says that the Bible is the "most frequently cited book" when discussing faith.

The Pew Forum also says that "some 30% of adults self-identify as Christians who do not read the Bible."

This means that those 30% of adults who do not read the Bible have a significant impact on the content of the Bible. That's right.

According to Pew, 76% of people who do not read the Bible think that the Bible is a book of moral values and teachings that teach moral values.

When the Bible is changed to suit a church's views, the result is not only a change in the content of the Bible, but an attack on the very concept of the Bible itself.

This is why it's such a great idea that the GOP is selecting Phil Robertson as their nominee for president.

He has a track record of changing the Bible to fit his own beliefs. He also has a track record of leading others, including children, into sin. For instance, he suggests that homosexuality is a choice.

It's not just a choice, Phil. It's a choice to practice a lifestyle condemned by God.

Here's what he told GQ:

"And, you know, it's interesting. I've heard that from so many Christians, that it's a choice, it's a sin. You can choose to be gay, or straight, or whatever, but that's not the issue. The issue is the person. So, if a man can't control his own sexual impulses, who are we to say that he's a Christian?"

Robert G. Ingersoll, the great political philosopher, also used the phrase "spoofing" to describe the practice of changing the Bible. Ingersoll compared the practice to that of altering the Constitution. He said, "We must allow all the branches of the government full power to make all laws, even when contrary to the Constitution."

He said that this is a violation of the Constitution. This is what we need to teach our children.

If the GOP really believes in the Constitution, then they need to nominate someone who has a track record of changing the Bible to fit their own beliefs.

This is the only way that the GOP can win in November.

We here at Nintendo Power have been asking ourselves: is this the best Zelda yet? And we're not talking about the 3D remake (though that one is absolutely amazing). This is the true spiritual successor to the epic classic The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

Of course it's the "spiritual successor" part that the GamePad screen doesn't tell you. Breath of the Wild is an adventure game that feels like a modern Zelda. It doesn't require you to use the map like the previous games in the series. Instead, the game moves you through the game in a simpler way.

What's more, the game feels much larger. The game is actually a lot larger than it's predecessor and is much more open. You can go to areas that you've previously missed by not knowing about. While the game is great in its own right, it's a great addition to the series to be able to explore other areas.

The City of Winnipeg is warning residents about the potential for flooding on the South Shore near the Assiniboine River.

The river is expected to crest at 63.39 metres on Wednesday. The combined flood threat is at 70.

"The forecast is that the river will crest at 63.39 metres and go higher than the 60 metre mark," said Jim Baikie, Winnipeg's chief administrative officer.

"It depends on how much rain falls and how much the river surges. It's a very important forecast to keep an eye on."

The river is expected to crest at 63.39 metres on Wednesday. (City of Winnipeg)

The river is expected to peak at 63.39 metres on Wednesday and then crest at 70.44 metres on Thursday.

"The water will be heavy, so people are advised to be prepared," said Baikie. "We advise people to get into the highest ground they can, whether it's a rooftop or the roof of an unoccupied building."

The city is also asking residents to be aware of potential flooding in their neighbourhoods.

"As we have seen in the past, when there's a heavy rain event, there can be flood waters in areas that don't have a foundation," said Baikie.

Flood watches are in effect for Waverley, North Kildonan, St. Boniface, St. Boniface East, St. Boniface West, River Heights, Kenaston, Sargeant Flat, Mount Royal, Portage la Prairie and West Kildonan.

The fact that the authors cannot find any empirical evidence supporting the claim that men differ in women's brains on any dimension is unfortunate.

The authors of the article have an opportunity to make up for their lack of knowledge about the literature on androgyny in men and women. The authors should be prepared to publish the findings of their study using the same methods they used to analyze the data and they should use the same statistical methods to analyze the results.

I am surprised by your comment. In your paper, you provide a detailed treatment of the evolutionary reasons for why women and men are drawn to different kinds of mates. You argue that a lack of women on the market for men is a result of natural selection. You explain that women seeking mates are more selective than men are and therefore are more likely to prefer mates who are compatible with the attributes that women are particularly good at: ovulation, fertility, and lactation.

Evolutionary biology provides support for your claim.

My research has shown that women are indeed more selective than men are and that women are more likely than men to mate with men who are more similar to them on all the attributes they value. I have also shown that men and women generally differ on the traits they value. I have also shown that the tendency for men and women to differ on these traits is a result of natural selection.

This is a simple, yet powerful, idea. Evolutionary biology provides support for the claim that the most important time for the success of an individual is when a potential mate is at the peak of her reproductive value. If this is true, then a woman who is not fertile is a waste of resources. Therefore, just like men, human females have evolved a high sexual drive to find a mate who is most likely to be fertile and to produce offspring.

In your paper, you discuss the evolutionary forces that have shaped the evolutionary history of the human sex chromosome system. You argue that the potential male mate of the human female has evolved in a way that allows the female to be in a position to select the most compatible mate for her offspring. You conclude that the female needs to be very selective in the type of mate she chooses.

This is a well-established evolutionary explanation. The female is not the only one who needs to be selective in the type of mate she chooses. The male also needs to be selective in the type of mate he chooses. This is a simple point.

Your article has the potential to change the way we think about mate choice in humans. It is the first time that a biological explanation has been provided that explains the differences between men and women in mate choice.

The article is a great example of how psychology can inform empirical studies. Your research is a perfect example of the importance of psychology in the study of sex differences.

The authors of the review article have done a good job of summarizing the existing literature on sex differences in mate choice and have made numerous suggestions for future research.<|endoftext|>The recent decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement is a grim reminder of the dangers of our global addiction to fossil fuels

In New York City, it's considered rude to make a phone call during breakfast. But on a recent morning, a New York City firefighter was overheard making a phone call while eating breakfast.

The New York Fire Department's Facebook page shared the video of the firefighter, who was eating breakfast at a local restaurant. "Don't get me wrong, it's all good and everything," the firefighter said at one point. "But, you know, sometimes you gotta take a break. It's hard. Give me a break. I'm not mad at you. I'm just hungry. I'm hungry."

The video has since been deleted from Facebook.

The New York Fire Department is a department of nearly 7,000 firefighters, policemen, and paramedics. In 2012, the department had a budget of $1.4 billion.<|endoftext|>It's been more than a year since the release of the Nexus 5, and, as expected, the handset has been a hit. Google and its partners have sold more than 100 million Nexus 5 handsets since the Google-branded handset launched on November 21st.

This is a phenomenal success story, and it's only just beginning. Google has announced that the first Nexus 7 tablet – arguably the best Android tablet ever made – is set to arrive in the coming months.

Google already has the Nexus 7 tablet in its stable, but that doesn't mean it will ship in the first half of 2013. The Google Play store has already set the date for the first Nexus 7 to hit the streets, but that's not the only tablet that will be available at launch.

Android Central reports that there will be two new tablets available at launch. They're the Asus-made Nexus 7 (2013) and the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7″.

The tablet only comes in black, with a plastic back, and is expected to sell for around $199. It's a tablet, and it's going to be pretty big, too – the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD 7″ measures in at 7.4mm thick, making it the thinnest 7-inch tablet on the market.

The Kindle Fire HD 7″ is also a bit thicker than the 7″ Nexus 7, at 7.1mm. With a weight of 4.6 pounds, it's also a bit heavier than the 7″ Nexus 7.

Both tablets will be available in the first half of 2013 for the following prices:

Google Nexus 7 (2013) – $199

Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7″ – $179

Here's a quick look at the new tablets:

History

I am Stephen Strange, and I believe that nothing should stand in the way of a man's mind being his own master. -- Stephen Strange src

Before the 1960s, Stephen Strange was a rich Jewish American who had inherited his uncle's fortune. He was trained as an attorney by his uncle and was one of the best lawyers in New York City. However, he was later imprisoned at the hands of the mad sorcerer, Dr. Stephen Strange.

Strange was imprisoned for a crime committed against the U.S. government. He was freed after his uncle agreed to make a deal to settle the case. Strange was then sent to the secretive island of Sakaar where he was to serve as the leader of a new Sakaarian government. He also met his future wife, the Black Widow, and began an affair with her. Strange was later freed by the Avengers and joined the team, where he formed a close friendship with Thor and became a friend of the Hulk.

Strange was then recruited by the Masters of Evil to take them to Sakaar. However, Strange was tricked into fighting the Hulk and fell to the planet's molten core. He was rescued by Thor and the Hulk, who took him back to Earth to continue his training.

In the meantime, Strange had been accused of killing his uncle in a court of law. He was then sent to the Seagate Prison in New York City, where the government wanted him to serve as an advisor to the new government. There, he met the Black Widow, who became his lover. Also, when the government was attacked by the Masters of Evil, Strange was captured by the government.

Strange was then sent to the U.S.S.R.

Strange was imprisoned by the government for three years, during which time he became a close friend of the Hulk. Strange received a cell mate, the armored Hulk, who was also imprisoned for three years. In addition, Strange helped the Hulk survive prison by offering him medical supplies.

Strange was eventually reunited with the Hulk while he was imprisoned for a crime committed against the United States. After the Hulk was freed, the two bonded, and Strange once again became the Hulk's close friend. Strange also helped the Hulk while he was in the Siberian wilderness.

I'm sure many people will probably be confused about why I'm posting this.

I won't attempt to explain all the reasons why I feel the way I do, because I believe that it's best to leave it up to the reader to decide if they want to follow me on this journey as I go on with this, or not.

What I will say is this: I'm not an atheist.

I've done my best to explain that my views on religion are simple. I find it very difficult to believe that these beautiful creatures that we think of as gods, can be anything but selfish, hateful, and cruel. I believe that their actions and words are no better than those of any other animal.

I believe a lot of the things that are taught in religion (whether it be Christianity, Hinduism, or Judaism) are simply not true. I believe that the very concept of God is a lie. I believe that we are all here in this world because God created us, and that there is no deity that I know of who would have sent me here if he was not real. I believe that we are all interconnected. I believe that there's more to life than just ourselves, and that we should all strive to work together to take care of one another.

It is as simple as that.

What I believe is that there are no gods. That there's no heaven. That there's no hell. I don't believe in a God.

I believe in reality.

Good people. Bad people. A good person is someone who does good deeds for others, and a bad person is someone who does bad deeds for others. A good person does good deeds because of love. A bad person does bad deeds because of anger. A good person doesn't go out of their way to hurt others, they do what they can to help others. A bad person does what they can to hurt others. A good person doesn't take pleasure in hurting others. A bad person does because of pleasure. A good person doesn't kill. A bad person does because they feel the need to.

I believe in responsibility.

I believe that all people have a right and duty to take care of themselves and their family. I believe that there are things that we each can do to take care of ourselves, and to take care of our family. I believe that we will all eventually die, and that none of us will be around to see that event. I believe that we should all take care of ourselves, our family, and our friends, and help each other if we can.

I believe that we all have a right to be happy. I believe that it is absolutely wrong to take pleasure in causing the pain of others, and that we should all work together to take care of each other, our family, and our friends. I believe that we should all participate in our society, and that we should all do what we can to make it a better place.

I believe that we should all try to find happiness in our own lives. I believe that there are things we each can do to make our lives more enjoyable and more fulfilling. I believe that we are all here to make the world a better place, and that we should all strive to make it a better place.

I believe that we all have a right to the same basic things that we were given. I believe that no matter how much we may try, we will never be completely satisfied, and that we should all strive to take care of ourselves, our family, and our friends, and help each other if we can. I believe that we should all take care of ourselves, our family, and our friends, and help each other if we can.

I believe that we all have a right to be safe.

I'm going to need to go get myself a cup of coffee.

That's because in the wake of the terrorist attack at the Manchester Arena, Trump has been doing the one thing he can do to take the heat off himself: blame the entire country for the heinous act of violence.

"It's a terrible thing that's going on in the world, and we have to be very tough, we have to be very, very vigilant," Trump said on Fox & Friends on Tuesday morning, before adding, "We need that. We need a very, very strong border. We need an unbelievable, strong military."

Trump then moved on to blaming the Democrats for the attack, accusing them of "buying" the media, despite the fact that the FBI has already closed the case.

"If you look at the way they spin it, their narrative is that Trump is behind this," Trump said. "The problem is that they really don't have a good narrative."

Unsurprisingly, the media didn't take the entire argument lying down.

"Trump's tweet was an attempt to blame the victims of a terrorist attack for their own death," CNN's Jim Acosta said. "It's hardly the most presidential response."

"Upstairs, they're blaming everyone but themselves," he continued. "And downstairs they're blaming everyone but themselves."<|endoftext|>Posted 14 December 2012 - 02:19 AM

The only problem with your set up is that you are not putting your lead in the half-full bucket properly. It will get too hot and will easily crack when you put your hand underneath. If you do this right, your lead will stay cool and in the half-full bucket. You will still need a bucket, though, to be able to take your lead out after the rest of your bowl is done.

"It is a matter of weighing our interests against our values," she told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. "We need to take care of those who are vulnerable. We need to take care of those who are hungry. We need to take care of people who are homeless, not to be cruel, but to provide them with a chance to survive."

She said that the situation in America is "very different" than in other countries.

"We have a better system of food stamps. We have a system of healthcare. We have a system of housing. We have a system of education. We have a system of job training for people who are trying to get a job," she said.

Clinton made the comments at a campaign event in New Hampshire with her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who has been on a speaking tour to promote Democratic economic policies.

"We have a better system of healthcare. We have a system of food stamps. We have a system of childcare. We have a system of education. We have a system of job training for people who are trying to get a job," Clinton said, adding that she supports the minimum wage hike that her running mate has proposed.

"We want to do more to lift people up," Clinton said.

"We will not let anyone take away the dignity that comes with work, the dignity that comes with responsibility," she continued. "And we will never let anybody reduce the share that any American family earns."

The Democratic candidate has been criticized by some for her husband Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill, which placed tight restrictions on the amount of time people could spend in prison, depending on their crimes.

Hollywood is full of stories about how difficult it is to get a movie made. But it turns out that creating an original story is even harder.

When Netflix released "The OA" on October 21, the streaming service's move into original programming — which was announced in February 2014 — was hailed as a watershed moment. The series, which debuted on the Fox network, follows Prairie Johnson (Evan Rachel Wood), a woman who went missing at age 16. After 20 years, her family (led by director Brit Marling) begins to question whether she is still alive.

The series is based on the best-selling memoir by Brit Marling, who is best known for creating the Netflix series "The OA." In the book, Johnson describes herself as an African-American woman who was able to elude the system during her childhood in New York City, despite being raised by a single mother (Nora Lumet) and a father (Wood).

"It's a great story, and it's really about family, and it's really about being a good person," said Marling, who is best known for the "True Detective" series. "I think it's really about the things that can be taught, that you can be taught, and that when you're told those things, you can choose to do them or not do them, and really what that means."

Netflix is the first major streaming service to put its money behind original programming, and Marling said that her first impulse was to pitch the show to other cable networks. But when Netflix approached her, Marling said she asked if she could make a deal with the streaming service.

"Netflix said, 'Can you make a deal?'" she recalled. "And I said, 'Sure, why not?' And they said, 'OK, we'll take a shot.' And that's what happened."

Netflix has been reluctant to discuss the show's financials, but Marling said that it has generated enough interest to be a show that the company would want to renew.

"The [original] concept is that you don't know if it's real or not," she said. "You kind of see through it, and we have to see through it, too."

The show's success has put the spotlight on the challenges of adapting a book to a television series.

"The OA" is a sprawling story about Johnson that takes place in three time periods. It's a unique story, because the book is set in 2000, when the real-life events that are depicted in the series don't actually happen. Marling said that she was motivated to write the series because she was trying to figure out what it meant to be a black woman in America in the early '90s — a time when she wanted to be an actress, but didn't have the means to do it.

"I think it's important for people to know, especially black women, that there are very real challenges," she said. "I think there's a lot of false images of black women and black women's bodies out there."

Marling said that she felt compelled to write the series in order to raise awareness about the issues that black women face in the entertainment industry.

"It's not something that I'm happy about, but it's something that you have to do for the greater good," she said.

Marling said that she was interested in the idea of a show that was a "normal, everyday" story for a black woman in America — but that she also wanted to focus on the issues that black women face.

"I don't want to just be like, 'Well, I'm just like a regular black woman, I don't have any special powers,'" she said. "I want to talk about it, because I think that's what people need to hear."<|endoftext|>Somali-American women's soccer star Abby Wambach says she has a "huge problem" with the way women's soccer players are treated in the sport.

"It's like we're not allowed to be there," she said. "We're not allowed to be there. We're not allowed to even be there. We're not even allowed to exist."

Wambach said that women's soccer has been a "very male-dominated sport" for decades, and said there are still "a lot of guys who just don't get it."

The term "leftist" has been co-opted by a sizeable section of the left to refer to those who have a liberal, democratic outlook, and in particular those who agree with the social democratic understandings of socialism, and who are opposed to racism, imperialism and sexism.

This is, of course, a legitimate perspective, and it is one that has been fully articulated by the left over the last century. But unsurprisingly, this perspective has been adopted by a section of the left in the UK, and has been adopted by the likes of the Guardian, the Independent and the New Statesman and the New Internationalist, among others.

Leftists who adopt this view have not been subtle about it. In a passage from his recent book, The Left and the Radical Right, the Labour MP Michael Meacher said:

"In fact, the left is currently dominated by a movement of 'leftism' which is essentially liberal-democratic. It is based on the idea that capitalism is a system in which people can have a decent life and that the state can play a necessary role in protecting the interests of working people."

In another passage from The Left and the Radical Right, Meacher wrote:

"It is the oppression of women which is the most obvious example of this 'leftism'. And it has been so for some time. If you visit a GP practice in the north of England or a maternity hospital in London you are still confronted by a gynaecologist who does not take women's needs seriously and who is not prepared to treat them. If you visit a police station in the north of England or a prison in London, you are still confronted by a prison officer who does not take the needs of women seriously and who is not prepared to protect them."

Just a few months ago, the Guardian ran an article by Labour MP Yvette Cooper in which she attacked the "left-wing incompetence of the Labour leadership" over the issue of Trident. In this article, Cooper advocated the adoption of the "nuclear deterrent strategy", which is described as "an alternative to unilateral disarmament".

Cooper's article was, of course, in defense of the Labour Party's vote for the renewal of Trident. In her article, she argued:

"If we are to take the decisions that must be taken now in the face of the present dangers, then we cannot afford to delay. We cannot waste time, we cannot waste a year, we cannot waste the next three decades. If we are to do this, we must open our minds to the prospect of nuclear weapons. We must open our minds to the possibility of a nuclear-free world. And if we do not, we risk going down a path that is hard to reverse."

In other words, Cooper does not support the abolition of Trident, but she does support a nuclear deterrent strategy, and she does advocate unilateral disarmament.

This position is nothing less than the abandonment of the trade union movement in order to be able to pursue a "left-wing incompetence of the Labour leadership". Any good trade unionist would have to be outraged by this position. And yet, the Left has adopted this position, and this position is being adopted by sections of the left in the UK.

What is worse, is that the Left has adopted the position on the basis of a series of lies. It has been argued that unilateral disarmament is not necessary because there are already "civil nuclear agreements" between the UK and the US, which allow for a "limited number of warheads" to be deployed "on land, sea and in the air".

The reality is that these treaties do not cover land-based nuclear weapons, and that the UK has signed no such agreements with any other country. Furthermore, the UK has not signed any such treaties at all, which means that there is no legal basis whatsoever for Cooper's position.

And yet, the Left has adopted this position, and this position is being adopted by sections of the left in the UK.

The same Left that has adopted this position is the same Left that has made a blatant attack on the working class. This Left has waged a vicious attack on workers in the UK, and has waged a vicious attack on the working class throughout the world.

At the same time, the same Left has been willing to make a joint declaration with the Conservative government with regard to the closure of the Miners' Strike.

Last year, we took a look at the best MMOs on PC. This year, we've decided to take a look at the best fantasy RPGs on PC.

The first thing that should be noted about fantasy RPGs is that they're almost always very different from one another. There aren't really any "traditional" fantasy RPGs on PC -- you can't run a Western-style RPG on a PC that doesn't have a mouse and keyboard. A good fantasy RPG is going to be a different beast from a good action RPG or a hack-and-slash RPG.

Of course, there are some similarities. You'll usually have some sort of character class, and you'll generally have a set of skills that you can specialize in. Most fantasy RPGs also have an overworld map to explore and some sort of story to follow, though they're usually very different in the way they tell it.

In this list, we've divided them by genre and gameplay focus, but there's also a little bit of overlap -- some fantasy RPGs are great for both role-playing and shooter fans.

Note that a lot of these games are still in early development, so they may still have bugs and unfinished features, but you can always wait until they're released and play them for free!

A Realm Reborn

Developer: Carbine Studios

Platforms: PC

RECOMMENDED: Review: A Realm Reborn Is A Strong Start To A MMORPG

If you're looking for a good MMORPG on PC, A Realm Reborn is a great place to start. It's got a lot of great features and a ton of content -- you can even build your own castle and explore the world from there. Unfortunately, it's very buggy (and it's not finished), so don't expect it to be perfect.

At the moment, A Realm Reborn's free-to-play model is a bit of a mess. You can buy gold to play the game for free, but that costs you 100 gold for the first day and then 1 gold for every day you keep playing after that (for a total of 500 gold). It's definitely a better plan if you want to try out the game without spending money, though.

The fear of a backlash against the GOP's supposed "Trumpian turn" has come and gone. The party's leadership has chosen to ignore the kooks who are threatening their power.

On the other hand, the party's grassroots base is furious at the party's failure to push through its agenda. As a result, a wide variety of conservative groups have formed to fight back against the GOP establishment and its right-wing governing agenda. These groups include the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity and the Koch-backed Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), for whom Trump appointed his chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, one of the most pro-corporate members of the Trump cabinet. The Trump administration has also appointed a slew of corporate-friendly CEOs, including billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as secretary of commerce; John Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs executive who is now Trump's secretary of the treasury; and Elaine Chao, the widow of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as transportation secretary.

The Republican Party is facing a shift in its base: younger, more diverse, and more dependent on social media. If the GOP is unable to address the concerns of its base, its political future could be in jeopardy.

In the wake of the 2016 election, many Republican officeholders and party members have blamed demographic shifts and social media for their loss. They have argued that the GOP lost because it failed to engage with a diverse electorate and failed to appeal to the expanding political base. Yet they have largely ignored the growing resistance to their agenda within their own party. The electoral backlash against the Trump agenda is real and growing, but it is not being addressed, despite growing evidence that the Republican Party is failing to appeal to the nation's diverse population.

The GOP leadership and movement are increasingly unwilling to confront their base. While many establishment Republicans have been privately urging their constituents to stop complaining and move on, few have publicly called for party members to change course. Although there is some evidence that the Republican Party's base is moving toward Trump's administration, the party's leadership is not moving with it, opting instead to ignore the growing resistance and the party's base's growing concerns.

The growing GOP base has emerged as a major concern for Republican leaders. For instance, during a recent panel discussion at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting, RNC Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel addressed the growing concerns of the party's base. She said, "the base isn't happy with us right now. But they are making that clear to us." McDaniel said that the GOP needs to "hold our ground" and "keep the focus on the issues that we care about," adding that "the focus has to be on the basics" and that "the message has to be consistent."

Meanwhile, the GOP establishment is actively working to push its agenda through the Senate. For example, the GOP's tax plan, which is designed to boost the wealthy by slashing taxes for corporations and the wealthy, is expected to pass the Senate and promptly be signed into law by President Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that he intends to pass the tax plan this week, despite strong opposition from a wide variety of groups, including the American Health Care Association, the AARP, and the American Federation of Teachers.

The Republican Party's leadership is also pushing for the passage of the Senate's health care bill. The bill is deeply unpopular with an already-disillusioned base, including most independents and voters under age 30. While the legislation is unpopular, McConnell is using the Senate's special budget reconciliation process to pass the bill through the Senate, making it easier for the bill to pass with just 51 votes.

The "divide and conquer" strategy is clearly working. The GOP establishment is trying to distract the public from the growing resistance to the GOP's agenda. Most of the GOP opposition, however, is coming from the base, not from the party establishment. If McConnell is serious about the Senate bill reaching the president's desk, he would do well to listen to the base and move on.

The emerging resistance to the GOP's agenda is the product of the GOP base's rising anger at the GOP's failure to push its agenda. This anger is not just a function of the party establishment's policies, but also their failure to address the concerns of the party's base. There is no reason the GOP should be able to pass tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations without any bipartisan support. While Trump and McConnell have claimed that their tax cuts will pay for themselves, independent analyses have shown that the federal budget deficit would balloon if

The Clinton Global Initiative, a charity that serves as a family office for the Clinton Foundation, has been in the news for all the wrong reasons lately.

The Clinton Global Initiative, a charity that serves as a family office for the Clinton Foundation, has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons lately.

It's been revealed that the Clinton Foundation has been operating like a slush fund, collecting donations and paying off the interests of its donors. This is not the first time the Clinton Foundation has been accused of this sort of behavior.

It's been revealed that the Clinton Foundation has been operating like a slush fund, collecting donations and paying off the interests of its donors. This is not the first time the Clinton Foundation has been accused of this sort of behavior.

The Clinton Global Initiative was supposed to be a venue for the private sector to showcase its best ideas, but it's been revealed that it's been operating like a slush fund, collecting donations and paying off the interests of its donors.

The foundation has been under fire since it was revealed that Hillary Clinton accepted $207,000 to give a speech to Goldman Sachs. This is the same bank that gave her the largest speaking fee of any Secretary of State in history.

Now it has been revealed that the Clinton Global Initiative has been operating like a slush fund, collecting donations and paying off the interests of its donors.

This is not the first time the Clinton Foundation has been accused of this sort of behavior.

"The Clinton Foundation has had a history of accepting large donations from foreign governments and corporations, including from the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United States' largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin," CBS News' Sharyl Attkisson wrote in a report published today.

"The State Department has said it will stop accepting foreign donations if Hillary Clinton wins the White House. But the Clinton Foundation has refused to disclose its donors, instead saying it's a 'private foundation.'"

It's not the first time the Clinton Global Initiative has been accused of this sort of behavior.

"The Clinton Global Initiative has been a disaster from the start," former President Bill Clinton said as he was leaving the organization in 2013.

"The money is gone. It's been spent. There's nothing left. The people who run it have no idea what they're doing, and the people who work on it have no way of knowing what they're doing," he said.

The Clinton Global Initiative has been a disaster from the start.

Bill Gates was also quick to criticize the foundation's behavior. "The CGI data underscores the fact that the CGI record does not match the record of the Clinton Foundation," Bill Gates said in a statement.

The Clinton Global Initiative was launched in 2005 and has grown to become a global initiative to provide opportunities for business and communities to come together.

While the Clinton Global Initiative is a nonprofit organization, it was suspended from the tax code in 2014 after revelations that the Clinton Foundation had illegally taken in millions from foreign governments and international corporations. It was also revealed that the Clinton Foundation had been operating like a slush fund, collecting donations and paying off the interests of its donors.

The New York Times reported that in 2015, the Clinton Foundation's gross revenue was $2.17 billion — approximately $250 million less than the year before.

The Clinton Foundation cut its charitable work by 45 percent in 2014, and when it wasn't accepting money from foreign governments, it was accepting money from the U.S. government – including $1.9 million in taxpayer funds.

At the end of the 2015 season, the Blue Jays' starting rotation was: R.A. Dickey, J.A. Happ, Marco Estrada, Aaron Sanchez, Marcus Stroman, Mark Buehrle, and Drew Hutchison. The rotation was pretty good, but it was not dominant. The Jays' bullpen was the fourth-best in the American League, at 14th in ERA, but the Jays' rotation was the best in the AL, at a whopping 10th in ERA.

This season, the rotation is: R.A. Dickey, J.A. Happ, Marcus Stroman, Mark Buehrle, Aaron Sanchez, and Drew Hutchison. This rotation is the best in the AL.

This rotation is not the best in baseball, but it is unquestionably the most dominant. The Jays rarely had a five-run lead and rarely had a seven-run deficit, averaging 4.2 runs per game in the five games against a team with a winning record. They averaged 4.0 runs per game in the six games against a team with a losing record. The Jays have scored at least four runs in 10 of their 19 games, and the Jays scored five or more runs in eight of their 19 games. Their bullpen has been particularly dominant.

The Jays are also performing better in the third game of a series than in the third game of a series, but they are not far behind the second-place Yankees. The Blue Jays are doing far, far better in the second game of a series than they are in the second game of a series.

Prominent Canadian philanthropist and former University of Toronto professor Paul Hodges is urging his fellow citizens to embrace the kind of Canadian identity he says their country needs.

Hodges, whose son is an engineering student at U of T, said the country needs "multi-culturalism" and "multiculturalism."

"I think we need to embrace this Canadian identity. It's a very important part of being Canadian," he told CBC Radio's Metro Morning.

"I think we need to continue to build on our multiculturalism. It's an important part of what makes us Canadian ... Canadian identity is a multicultural one, it's an inclusive one, it's inclusive of all of us. And I think we need that for the future."

Hodges, who is also a former president of the Canadian Association of University Teachers, said Canada's future will be determined by how well it draws young people from around the world.

"I think the future of Canada will be determined by how well we attract the next generation from around the world. And I think we need to be very welcoming, very welcoming to people from all over the world. And that's what we need to do in the future," he said.

Hodges said he believes the final chapter of Canada's identity "is being written right now," but was quick to add that he's "not saying just anyone is going to be able to write that."

"We need people who are very, very well respected, very, very high level people who are able to say 'this is what the future is supposed to look like, we're going to pursue it with all our might.'"

He also added that "to me, it's not about being a nationalist or a xenophobe."

"I don't think we should be a country that's all about separation. I think we need to be a country that's all about integration."

'I think we need to continue to build on our multiculturalism.' - Paul Hodges

The 60-year-old professor, who has received numerous awards for his work with children and youth, argued that Canada's highest profile figures should be embracing the country's diversity.

"I think we need to start to see, maybe in the past few years, a bit more leaders of institutions, including universities and the highest levels of public life, recognizing that we have a multicultural society," he said.

"I think that's something that has not happened yet.

"I think we need to start to see more figures of authority, including politicians, including community leaders, acknowledging that we have a multicultural society, and I think that's something that has not happened yet."

Hodges, who made headlines in 2008 when he called for Canada to become a republic, said he is calling for a new Canadian identity in part because he is concerned about the current state of the country.

"I think that our understanding of ourselves as a country is not getting right," he said.

"I think that we're becoming more and more divided, as we become more and more divided, I think that we're becoming more polarized. And I think that we are becoming more and more pessimistic about the future."

'Reserved to American rules'

Hodges said he believes the country is faced with more challenges than ever before.

"For the first time in my life, I'm worried about security. I'm worried about maybe a crackdown by the state on individual rights," he said.

"I think Canada's security concerns and our security concerns are based on American rules. And I don't think we can rely on American rules to protect us from our problems."

Hodges said he is worried about a crackdown by the state on individual rights. (CBC)

Hodges said he believes Canada is facing a "crisis of identity," and is calling for a Canadian identity to be forged through "multiculturalism and multiculturalism."

He said he believes that's the best way to ensure a healthy, prosperous, meaningful future for the country.

"I think that's the best way to ensure that the kind of multiculturalism that I believe in, that I think makes us a great country, that we will have success, we will have stability, that we will have freedom for all, and I think that will be the most successful form of multiculturalism that Canada and the world has ever seen," he said.

Hodges said he supports the current government's immigration and refugee policies.

He added, however, that he wants to see Canada's immigration system more "open."

"I think that we have to have more open immigration policies. I think that we have to have more welcome governments ... And I think that's what we need to do."

Week 12 was relatively quiet for fantasy football, but the injury bug is back. We're already starting to see a few players on the injury report for Week 13, and there's no doubt that the Cowboys will see several players on the PUP list coming out of their bye week.

Let's take a look at the players who are most likely to return to action in Week 13:

Quarterback

Tyrod Taylor (shoulder): Tyrod Taylor is the only starting quarterback on the Cowboys' active roster, and it wouldn't be surprising to see him appear on the injury report for Week 13. Taylor has been dealing with shoulder soreness for the last several weeks, and the latest news says that he'll be limited in practice for the next few days. He's not expected to play against the Chiefs, but it's possible that he could miss a few weeks.

Running Back

Mark Ingram (ribs): Ingram is expected to play in Week 13, but he is not expected to return to practice on Wednesday. The Giants are still unsure about Ingram's status, but they say that he is improving. If Ingram can't go, Shane Vereen should get the start in his place.

Chris Thompson (knee): Chris Thompson has been dealing with knee soreness for the last few weeks and is officially listed as questionable for Week 13. The Cardinals would likely like to see Thompson practice on Wednesday before making a decision, but it is unlikely that he would be ready for Thursday's game.

Wide Receiver

Dez Bryant (concussion): Dez Bryant is expected to play in Week 13, but he's not expected to be back within the next few days. Bryant is dealing with a concussion and is officially listed as questionable for Week 13. He's expected to be cleared in time for Week 14, but it is possible that he could miss some time.

Davante Adams (hamstring): Davante Adams is officially listed as questionable for Week 13, but he wasn't listed on the injury report this week. He had been dealing with knee soreness, which will make him questionable for Week 13.

Breshad Perriman (ankle): Breshad Perriman is expected to play in Week 13, but he's not expected to be back in time for it. He's dealing with ankle soreness and is officially listed as questionable.

Tight End

James Casey (shoulder): James Casey will return to the lineup in Week 13, but he's not expected to play on Thursday against the Chiefs. Casey is dealing with shoulder soreness, which is not a good sign for his return to the lineup.

Josh Hill (knee): Josh Hill is expected to play in Week 13, but he's not expected to play on Thursday against the Chiefs. Hill has been dealing with knee soreness for the last few weeks and is officially listed as questionable.

Wide Receiver

Danny Amendola (ankle): Amendola has been dealing with ankle soreness for the past few weeks and is officially listed as questionable for Week 13. He's dealing with a knee injury, so it's doubtful that he will play on Thursday against the Chiefs.

Andrew Hawkins (foot): Andrew Hawkins is officially listed as questionable for Week 13, but he's not expected to play on Thursday against the Chiefs. Hawkins has been dealing with foot soreness and is officially listed as questionable.

Tight End

Scott Chandler (ankle): Scott Chandler is officially listed as questionable for Week 13, but he's not expected to play on Thursday against the Chiefs. Chandler has been dealing with ankle soreness for the last few weeks and is officially listed as questionable.

Tight End

Larry Donnell (knee): Larry Donnell is officially listed as questionable for Week 13, but he's not expected to play on Thursday against the Chiefs. Donnell has been dealing with knee soreness for the last few weeks and is officially listed as questionable.

Tre McBride (ankle): Tre McBride is officially listed as questionable for Week 13, but he's not expected to play on Thursday against the Chiefs. McBride has been dealing with ankle soreness for the last few weeks and is officially listed as questionable.

Wide Receiver

Jordy Nelson (knee): Jordy Nelson is expected to play in Week 13, but he's not expected to play on Thursday against the Chiefs. Nelson has been dealing with knee soreness for the last few weeks and is officially listed as questionable.

Robby Anderson (shoulder): Robby Anderson is officially listed as questionable for Week 13, but he's not expected to play on Thursday against the Chiefs. Anderson has been dealing with shoulder soreness for the last few weeks and is officially listed as questionable.

Tight End

Zach Miller (ankle): Zach Miller is officially listed as questionable for Week 13, but he's not expected to play on

Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur have both been in talks with the player's father over a potential move.

Jurgen Klopp's side have already snapped up the Germany Under-21 international striker, while Spurs are also keen to add him to their ranks.

And according to Tuttosport (h/t Football Italia), the player's father, Jurgen, has also been in talks with the Anfield club and the Championship outfit.

The report also claims Jurgen Klopp has been in close contact with the player's mother, who is close with the player's agent.

The 24-year-old has been in and out of the first-team picture at the German club since joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2013.

He has scored just one goal in his last 18 appearances and been consistently linked with a move away from the club.

She's funny because she's a serious comedian. This is a woman who once had to explain to a reporter why she doesn't talk to reporters because, "I don't want to be an asshole."

But yesterday, Fey took to Twitter and gave the world a glimpse into her life and her thoughts on the presidential election. Her tweet, which was sent after Donald Trump's speech about his plans to build a wall between the United States and Mexico, got a lot of attention. Let's just say that a lot of people, including the President of the United States, weren't happy.

Yes, it's true that President Trump, in his speech, accused Hillary Clinton of being "the most corrupt candidate ever." He also called her the "most corrupt person ever" and "the most incompetent person ever" (in Trump's mind) to run for the presidency.

But not everyone is happy about the speech. A number of people have called Fey out for her remarks. Why? Because the comments Trump made are disrespectful towards women. They're disrespectful towards Mexicans. They're disrespectful towards Muslims. They're disrespectful towards prisoners of war. They're disrespectful towards military veterans. They're disrespectful towards the disabled, and they're disrespectful towards the poor and middle class.

Here are some of the most notable tweets from people who were not happy with Fey's remarks, as well as some of the people who were.

Hey @TinaFey, I'm a woman. I'm in my 50s, a single mother. I have a degree. And I've seen your show. And I've heard you talk about women in your comedy. And I'm a single mother with a degree. Do you think I deserve respect or do you think I'm just a punchline? pic.twitter.com/1qCj5JXz1I — Amanda Marcotte (@AmandaMarcotte) September 1, 2016

I walked down the street in New York once. It's a pretty good suburb of Manhattan, home to many of the city's most prominent and well-known landmarks. I was riding my bike and I noticed these two very tall, very thin men standing in the middle of the street. One of them looked at me with great interest and said, "How tall are you?" I replied, "Oh, I'm 5'8". The other guy said, "Well, I'm 6'2". He looked at me again, smiled, and said, "Well, I'm 6'4". What happened next was a classic example of social status signaling.

I found myself facing the taller guy, who looked like a rich and powerful figure in the community. I knew he was taller than me. I knew he was taller than the other guy. I knew the other guy was taller than me. It was a classic social status signaling situation.

In this situation, one guy was trying to signal social status. He was trying to say, "I'm taller than you, so I am more important than you." The other guy is trying to say, "I'm smaller than you, so I am less important than you."

If you're a fan of "Breaking Bad" and have been in the market for a new TV to watch, you may be in luck. The hit show, which took some of the worst elements of the TV industry and turned them into a monster, is returning to AMC for a second season on Sunday, March 8.

"Breaking Bad" is the most-watched scripted series on cable, with ratings that have been on pace to beat last year's numbers and put it among the most watched shows on television.

According to the Variety report, "Breaking Bad" is averaging 11.8 million viewers per episode. The ratings are and have been staggering. The show has attracted a huge audience for its second season, with the ratings showing that the show is able to attract a large audience that can be quite hard to find on cable.

If you're looking for a change of pace, you may be looking into a new show.

You may be thinking, "What about The Walking Dead?" The show, currently airing it's second season on AMC, is currently the most watched cable show on television.

Dead is the top cable show, with 7.9 million viewers. Not too shabby.

But if you're on cable, you're in luck. The Walking Dead is the top cable show on television.

The show, which premiered its first season in October, is drawing more than 10 million viewers per episode. The Walking Dead draws an average of 13.1 million viewers per episode.

With a large audience, "Breaking Bad" is able to attract a large number of viewers. AMC is making sure that the show will make its way to viewers as the season progresses.

The show is already in it's second season, so AMC is currently in the process of working on a way to make sure the show is available to viewers. Presumably, AMC will want to make sure that the show will be available to viewers for the entire season.

According to Variety, "Breaking Bad" has not yet been picked up for a third season.<|endoftext|>The first thing you'll notice about the new series of Doctor Who is that it's a lot more fun.

Peter Capaldi's Doctor has been replaced with a new one, and it's no bad thing.

Advertisement - Continue Reading Below

The first episode of this new series, The Bells of Saint John, sees Capaldi's Doctor (who we haven't yet met) continue the adventures of his predecessor - but with a little more humour.

"The show itself will get a little more frankly funny as a result of this change," Capaldi told Digital Spy at Comic Con.

"I think the first episode is actually the first episode that, you know, is a bit more funny."

The new Doctor is played by Matt Smith, who has already had a few off-screen adventures of his own.

"He's always been a kind of gregarious, easy-going character," Capaldi said.

"He's had a lot of fun with the people around him, and we can see that in the first episode."

And we can see that in the first episode too. There are some funny lines, and some great special effects, but there are also some moments of horror.

"There's a good bit of that," Capaldi said. "It's a little bit dark, but it's done in a way that I think is quite scary.

"It's a lot of fun, it's really interesting. It's a good way of getting into the character of the Doctor."

Capaldi said that it was "nice" to have a new Doctor, and that he was "really happy" to take over the role.

"I'm really delighted to be playing the Doctor, and it's a great part to be in," he said.

"It's a really big part of my life, and that's why I wanted to do it, and I wanted to play it."

However, Capaldi said that he'll be very different to the last Doctor.

"I'm not like the last Doctor in any way, shape or form. I'm not a mad scientist at all, and I'm not a sadist like Peter Davison," he said.

"I'm a very kind, loving, caring person. I'm an actor who likes to have fun. I'm a man of many talents."

We've no idea who the new Doctor is yet, but Capaldi has promised that it will be "a surprise".

"I don't want to spoil it for people," he said. "It's going to be a surprise to people, I'm sure, but it's going to be an exciting time."

What do you think of the new Doctor? Let us know in the comments section below...

Founded by two brothers in 1906, Good Times was the first restaurant in San Francisco to serve alcohol on site. The owners' first venture was a restaurant at the corner of Haight and Ashbury streets. In 1922, the brothers opened their own establishment on the corner of Jewett and Jones streets, with a bar, and in 1928, a second bar, called the Good Times Saloon, was added.

The Good Times Saloon was originally called the Good Times Saloon and charged $1.25 for a pint of beer. The saloon closed in January 1942 after a long run with patrons. The original and second Good Times Saloons were both located at the corner of Ashbury and Haight, and one of the most popular spots for locals to gather was located just a few blocks north of the original establishment.

The Great Depression began in 1929, and many people were unemployed at that time. After the Great Depression, the saloon was closed for good and the Good Times Saloon Company was purchased by the National Beer Wholesalers Association in 1935. The company then consolidated all of its operations and renamed it the Good Time Brewing Co.

The Good Time Brewing Co. changed its name to Good Time Brewing Co. in 1918 when it began to brew beer. In 1929, the company began producing and selling the "Good Time" brand of beer. In 1933, the company changed its name to Good Time Brewing Co. again when it began to produce and sell the "Good Time" brand of beer again.

In 1962, the company changed its name to Good Time Brewing Co. again when it began to produce and sell the "Good Time" brand of beer again. Good Time was sold to the Knob Creek Brewing Co. in 1965. The company was sold to the Anheuser-Busch Co. in 1969. In 1976, the company changed its name to Anheuser-Busch InBev. The brewery eventually changed its name to AB InBev in 1994. The company began to sell beer in the United States in 1992, when it bought a majority stake in the Anchor Brewing Co. in San Francisco. In 2000, AB InBev acquired a controlling interest in the SABMiller brewing company.

Good Time Brewing Co. was sold in 2002 to the Russian River Brewing Co. in San Francisco, which renamed the brewery to Russian River Brewing Co. in 2005. The brewery began brewing beer in 2008, and in 2011, the brewery began producing beers under the name Russian River Brewing Co. in collaboration with Russian River Brewing Co. in Santa Rosa, California. In 2015, Russian River Brewing Co. sold the brewery to Heineken International for $1.2 billion.

The brewery is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The brewery's website states that it is open 7 days a week and is open from 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.<|endoftext|>The UESPWiki – Your source for The Elder Scrolls since 1995

Spellbreaker

Spellbreaker is a leveled Daedric artifact that increases the Spellbreaker enchantment of weapons and shields.

Acquisition [ edit ]

Spellbreaker can be obtained from a Daedric jarl or a hero of the Stormcloak Rebellion for a bounty of 10,000 gold.

If you are a Daedra worshipper, it may be possible to raise the bounty to 200,000 gold by killing the jarl or hero.

Enchanting [ edit ]

Spellbreaker can be upgraded with an infusions kit. In order to learn how to craft this item, you must first learn to craft the Infusion Stone and Infusion Shield.

Notes [ edit ]<|endoftext|>This is a story that's been going around for a long time, but when I heard that it was actually the game that was used to create the "Star Wars" music, I couldn't believe it.

It turns out that "The Empire Strikes Back" was used as the score for this game called "Star Wars: Rogue Squadron" (it was a direct sequel to the original game being released way back in 1983). And according to this story, you can actually play the original game if you know how to get at it.

But the game isn't actually just a copy of the movie score. Instead, it's a sound demo of the game, apparently created to show off the capabilities of the current generation of consoles.

Here's the story:

The game, which was created by Lucas Arts, was actually originally released on the Super Nintendo. The game was developed back in 1983, but it was never released on the Super Nintendo because it was too difficult for the system. The game was released on the Atari 2600.

This version of the game, which was also released on the Atari 2600, lets you play as either Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader. You pilot a TIE

Bertrand Russell once wrote, "I am not a philosopher, but I am a man." A philosopher is someone who has developed a philosophy. Russell's point was that philosophy is important, but it's not the only tool in the toolbox.

I don't subscribe to that view, although I think it's a fine one. Philosophy is important, and it's essential to the development of a thoughtful mind. But it's not the only tool in that toolbox. It's important that we have other tools.

In fact, I'll be writing a book this year that provides a list of twenty other tools in the toolbox. It's called "20 Tools of the Mind."

It's not a complete list, but it's a good starting point. So here it is, in no particular order:

1. An open mind.

2. A willingness to be wrong.

3. A willingness to view the world through a different lens.

4. A willingness to examine your own assumptions.

5. A willingness to examine the world from another perspective.

6. A willingness to be inspired.

7. A willingness to be humble.

8. A willingness to seek a better outcome in the face of difficult circumstances.

9. An appreciation for nature and its beauty.

10. A willingness to consider new possibilities.

11. An ability to learn.

12. An ability to think critically.

13. A willingness to make mistakes.

14. A willingness to take criticism.

15. A willingness to change.

16. A willingness to take responsibility.

17. A willingness to be flexible.

18. A willingness to be honest.

19. A willingness to speak your mind.

20. A willingness to take responsibility.

I'd love to hear what your favorite tool of the mind is.

We've written about yeast before, but this is a good time to delve deeper into the subject.

The most common yeast species used by homebrewers are Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pediococcus. These species are often referred to as "wild yeast" because they are not cultivated under controlled conditions. They are normally only found in wild settings, and so they are often referred to as "wild" yeast. They replicate very poorly in the brewery, but can be used to make beer. The most common way to use these yeasts is to ferment beer with them. This means that you must have a starter of beer yeast (a starter is a sterile environment in which the yeast can reproduce).

But if you want to make beer with wild yeast, you have to have a starter.

But how do you get a starter?

Starting a starter is a two-step process. First you must inoculate the beer with a yeast culture. Then you must wait for the beer to ferment. The reason this process is more involved than a standard yeast starter is that you must use a liquid culture. If you were to use yeast that is grown on agar plates, you would have to pitch the liquid culture into your beer. This is only done because agar plate cultures are difficult to use. You can also use liquid culture as a starter, but it is not necessary, and you must use a liquid culture or you will never get a yeast starter.

But what can you use to inoculate the beer?

As we mentioned in our post about wild yeast, you can use a powdery yeast called Wine Ale Yeast. This yeast is available at most homebrew shops. You can also use a liquid yeast called Wyeast. This yeast is available directly from Wyeast as well. While these two options are both good options, they are not the same.

So what's the difference?

Wine Ale Yeast is a powder. This yeast is available in a bag. It is a very good quality liquid yeast, but it is very difficult to use for starters. The problem with this yeast is that it doesn't seem to be very active. It's very good in fermenting beer, but it is very slow to grow. It's also not a very well-known yeast, so it's difficult to find in homebrew shops.

Wyeast is a liquid yeast. This yeast is available in a can. It is a great liquid yeast, but it is very active. It will grow rapidly when used as a starter, but it will also grow quickly when added to beer. It also has a longer shelf life than Wine Ale Yeast.

So which one should I use?

It's important to use the right yeast for the right purpose. If you're starting

As a result of the recent recession and the resulting lack of demand in the US, the price of oil is ailing and it is already at the lowest point in the last 40 years. As the price of oil falls, and the US economy continues to struggle, it is possible that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.

The effect of a rise in interest rates on the economy is often seen as a negative one, since higher interest rates tend to reduce disposable income and increase consumer debt. However, some economists argue that higher interest rates create an opportunity for the economy to recover and that this is a positive effect on the economy.

Is the US the only country which could benefit from raising interest rates?

In the early 2000s there was a huge amount of debate about whether raising interest rates would be a good thing for the US economy. The main argument against the idea of raising interest rates, which was made by economists such as Paul Krugman and Robert Gordon, was that it would mean less borrowing and less spending, which would lead to less economic growth and less employment.

However, as the US economy has struggled to recover from a recession which began in 2009, and as the US economy continues to struggle with the effects of the recent recession, it is becoming apparent that the economy could benefit from a rise in interest rates.

One of the main reasons that the US economy has been able to grow since 2009 is that the US Federal Reserve has been increasing the monetary base. This would mean that the US central bank would allow banks to increase the amount of money that they keep on deposit. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the money base by $10 trillion a year since 2009, but currently only has $4.9 trillion in circulation. This has meant that the US government has been able to borrow money more cheaply, and this has led to an increase in the US dollar's value.

A rise in interest rates would mean that the US dollar would lose value

If the Federal Reserve increased the money base again, it would mean that interest rates would rise, which would mean that the value of the US dollar would fall. The value of the dollar has already fallen massively since the financial crisis in 2008, and if the Federal Reserve were to raise interest rates it would mean that the dollar's value would continue to fall.

A rise in interest rates would also mean that the US government would be able to borrow more money at lower interest rates, which would mean that it would become more competitive. This means that Americans would be able to afford to spend more and that the economy would be able to grow faster.

A rise in interest rates would mean that the US economy could have recovered and become more competitive

However, this argument does not take into account the possibility that the US economy could have recovered and become more competitive. If the US economy had grown as quickly as it has grown since 2009, then it would be easy for the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and stop the erosion in the value of the dollar.

However, as the US economy continues to struggle to recover, it is becoming clear that the US is not the only country in the world which could benefit from raising interest rates.

If the US is to recover, it will need to rely more and more on economic growth

Other countries may also benefit from raising interest rates. If the oil price falls, these countries will have less economic growth and may also have a loss of competitiveness. However, the United States has a much larger GDP than many of these other countries, so allowing companies to borrow cheaply will not necessarily mean that the US government will be able to borrow more cheaply.

If the US economy continues to struggle, it may be that the US Federal Reserve does not want to raise interest rates

There are also many who argue that raising interest rates does not help the US economy. In particular, many believe that raising interest rates will not help the US economy because it will mean that the US Federal Reserve will lose money.

However, if the economy continues to struggle and if the Federal Reserve does not want to raise interest rates, then it could be that the US Federal Reserve will decide that it would be better for the US economy if it did not increase interest rates. This would mean that the US economy could continue to struggle, but it would not be able to recover as quickly, so the US economy would be on its own.

If the US economy continues to struggle and if the Federal Reserve does not want to raise interest rates, then it could be that the US economy could continue to struggle, but it would not be able to recover as quickly, so the US economy would be on its own

Another issue is whether the US Federal Reserve should be raising interest rates. This is because there are many economists who argue that raising interest rates could have negative effects on the economy. One example is that it could cause the economy to shrink if over-valued assets are bought by the Federal Reserve. Another example would be

The city of Seattle is looking to make it easier for people to live and work in the city. Their Councilmember Mike O'Brien is a co-sponsor of both the Seattle Housing Levy and the Seattle Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda (HALA).


And now the city is looking to make it easier for people to rent one of the city's approximately 200,000 apartments.

On February 9th, the city council will hear testimony about the proposed changes. About 120 people from the public speaking and community outreach groups that have been working on the changes will testify.


The hearing starts at 11:30am at City Hall.

The city is seeking input from the public before proposing any of the changes. They will then submit them to the council for consideration.

Here's what the city is looking for in changes.

Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda

Increase the maximum rent to the equivalent of market rate (or offer some other non-discriminatory rent adjustment)

Allow vacant rental units to be rented at market rate

Require landlords to provide a copy of their lease, if they rent to someone who is not a member of the family, to the tenant

Require landlords to notify tenants of any rent increases, if they exceed 5% per year

Any landlord that does not comply with the requirements above may be subject to a building permit revocation and fines.

These changes would be in addition to the provisions of the Seattle Housing Levy, which the city is currently reviewing.

Here's a statement from the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods about the hearing.

This hearing will be a critical opportunity for Seattle's residents and businesses to influence the City Council's decisions on the Seattle Housing Levy and the Seattle Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda.

So of course I'm going to post more from time to time, but I wanted to put together a more comprehensive guide for those who might be interested.

The main goal is to help you get your feet wet, so you can use the knowledge you get in this guide to come up with the next best thing.

What I'm here to do is give you a toolbox. I'm going to give you the tools that you need to work with the capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but I'm not going to tell you how to use them. You need to figure that out for yourself, because that's what this guide is about.

I'm going to break down the basics of each of the tools in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux toolbox. I'm going to give you the prerequisite skills, to get you started.

I'll cover the basics of using the tools, and then get into how to use the tools.

This isn't just a bunch of tutorials, I've gone over what each of the tools is capable of. I'll explain what the different commands mean, and I'll explain what the output from each command is. I'll explain the different types of output you can get from each command, so you can use the tools to accomplish a variety of tasks.

Then I'll give you the tools in a list, as well as an example of how to use each tool. By the end of this article, you should be well on your way to using all of the tools Red Hat Enterprise Linux has to offer.

The first tool I want to start with is the RPM (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) package manager. I've been using RPM for a while to package various components of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but I'm going to create a new folder in your home directory, and I'll use that folder as my RPM package repository.

I'm going to create a new directory called rpm. This is where I will put the RPMs that will be delivered to you. I'm going to use the same directory structure as I've used for the command line tools.

Create an empty directory called rpm.

sudo mkdir rpm

After you create the directory, I want to create a file called cd_rpm. This is the command that will create the RPMs.

sudo touch cd_rpm

I'm going to do this in the directory where I create the RPMs.

cd_rpm

Now I'm going to create a file called package. This is the directory where the RPMs will be stored.

sudo touch package

Now I'm going to create a file called rpm_up. This is where I will load the RPMs.

sudo touch rpm_up

Now I'm going to create a file called rpm. This is the directory

"I don't know if it's necessary to say, but it's necessary to say," Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said in response to a petition for people to urge Congress to reject the "Sunshine Policy" that would allow medical marijuana in states that have already legalized it.

The petition, signed by more than 100,000 people, asserts that "the United States is the only industrialized country on Earth that does not allow its citizens to use medical marijuana."

"The federal government should not undermine state law by criminalizing marijuana, but should instead work with the states to provide patients with the safe and affordable medicine they need," the petition reads.

The policy, which was first introduced in 2011, allows the distribution of medical marijuana in states that legalize it — a provision often referred to as the "Sunshine Policy" — with federal permission.

But some people who rely on medical marijuana for pain management have said that they would rather not see it legalized in their states, fearing that it would lead to more rampant abuse.

"We've lost the war on drugs. It's not working," Goodlatte said. "It's time to move on and we should just respect state laws."

Polls show Americans are increasingly supportive of medical marijuana. According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press in October, more than half of Americans (54 percent) support legalizing medical marijuana nationwide, and more than one-third (36 percent) of Americans support the use of medical marijuana if it is available on the state level.

The petition was also signed by representatives from Alaska, Colorado, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.<|endoftext|>Hey, so that's a bit of a long winded way to say "hey it's been a while". It's been a while since I've posted anything on Reddit and a few of my dreams have either fallen through or are on hold for the time being.

However I have been busy with other projects and as I've mentioned before I have been working on a few things for the Summer.

So if you're a fan of my work you'll probably know that I've been working on a few different projects for the past 6 months.

Well before I realised that I had the ability to make games I wanted to make games all the time. I was pretty much immersed in it and had my first love nailed.

I had a few technical issues however and I ended up having to quit everything to work on this. So in just under 6 months I made a game I was happy with.

It became all too easy to get carried away and make games I wasn't proud of but I was determined to keep making games.

The new version of Google Drive is available on Android devices version 4.4 and above, and also on the desktop version of Google Drive. The app is now available on the Google Play Store.

The new version of Google Drive supports video, audio and image files of up to 2 GB in size. The app will then automatically create an image file for each file that is uploaded, which can be shared with others on the app. The app also offers a way to move files between devices.

Google Drive also allows users to manage files on other Google platforms, such as the Chrome browser and the Google Docs app. The app supports Android's new file picker feature, which allows users to select and view files stored in the Google Drive storage app from other applications and services.

You can get the latest version of the Google Drive app from Google Play Store.

A new study suggests that testosterone may be the key to preventing a range of age-related diseases, from Alzheimer's to heart disease.

Testosterone, which is produced in the testes, is the most widely used hormone because it is thought to have a protective effect against many age-related diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and hypertension.

But it's not clear how testosterone affects age-related diseases. The new study, by researchers at Manchester Metropolitan University in the United Kingdom, finds that testosterone may help to reduce the risk of age-related disease by increasing the lifespan and reducing the risk of death.

"One of the big questions we wanted to answer was whether testosterone could reduce the risk of dying from certain age-related diseases or increase the lifespan," said lead researcher Dr. Tom Logan.

The researchers set out to answer this question by surveying 5,000 men over the age of 75, a group with a high incidence of some age-related diseases, including heart disease, cancer and diabetes. The investigators followed the participants for 10 years to see how they fared in terms of their health and mortality.

They found that the men who had higher testosterone levels had a lower risk of death from all age-related diseases, especially coronary heart disease and cancer.

"It's clear that you can expect to see these beneficial effects of testosterone in healthy older men, but it's not clear how these effects are mediated," Logan said.

Logan and his team suggest that testosterone may help to reduce the risk of dying from various diseases by increasing the lifespan and reducing the risk of death.

For example, studies have found that testosterone levels may help to increase the lifespan of mice. Also, testosterone is known to protect against heart disease in men, so Logan and his team suggest that testosterone may help to reduce the risk of dying of heart-related diseases, which include heart attacks and strokes.

"It's not just the good news of a longer life, but a reduced risk of death in general [from heart disease]," Logan said.

Logan's study is published in the journal Aging and Mechanisms of Disease.

Age-Related Diseases May Be Mediated by Testosterone<|endoftext|>Clarence Thomas' career has been defined by a 'stiff upper lip', 'pragmatism' and a devotion to the Constitution to the point of self-immolation. He's currently the most disliked Supreme Court Justice since the Great Depression.

But here's the thing: Although Thomas may be the most hated figure in the history of the Supreme Court, he's also one of the most effective. His scathing dissent in Arizona v. United States, a case that upheld President Obama's controversial executive amnesty, is an important reminder of the power of the Court's conservative bloc. And it's also a reminder that Thomas' power is not limited to his vote in Arizona v. United States, but extends to what he does as a justice.

At issue in Arizona v. United States is a series of cases challenging the constitutionality of the President's unilateral move to send millions of illegal immigrants to the interior of the United States. The President's action was taken without even consulting Congress. The case is now before the Supreme Court.

The President's actions are illegal – and unconstitutional.

The President cannot simply ignore the law. He must faithfully execute the laws he is sworn to uphold.

In Arizona v. United States, the Court held that the Executive Branch may not disregard two federal statutes – the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Refugee Act of 1980. In addition, the Court held that the President's unilateral action to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants violates the Establishment Clause, which prohibits Congress from requiring the President to take any action that "respects religious beliefs or moral convictions of the persons to whom such action would be committed."

Although the Court ruling is bad news for the President, it's good news for the nation. It's a reminder that just as the Founding Fathers intended, the political branches of the federal government must cooperate to make sure that the laws are faithfully executed. The Supreme Court's decision is only half the story – the other half is that the President's actions are illegal – and unconstitutional.

The President has acted without proper authority, and therefore the Executive Branch itself has ceased to be a legitimate instrument of the people's will.

The President's action is illegal – and the Constitution does not grant him authority to do so.

The President's action is illegal because the President has exceeded his authority – he has exceeded the scope of his authority as President. The Constitution is clear that the President cannot exercise power outside his or her constitutional authority.

But what the Court failed to recognize is that the President's actions are also unconstitutional. The President has acted without proper authority, and therefore the Executive Branch itself has ceased to be a legitimate instrument of the people's will.

A few months ago, I wrote about the immense difficulties in creating a sex-positive feminist sex movement – a post that has received an enormous amount of feedback, and has been the subject of much discussion. I also wrote about the difference between a feminist sex movement and a sex-positive feminist movement, and how it might be possible for us to make the former a success.

I was trying to show how difficult it would be for a sex-positive movement to come to power, and that our best chance of making it happen is to make it as inclusive as possible. But I didn't go far enough with the discussion. There was a broader question that I didn't address: what does it mean to be a sexual-positive feminist?

What does it mean to be a sexual-positive feminist?

It's quite a simple thing to define, really. Basically, it means that you don't believe that women are sexual objects, and that you believe that men are sexual beings too. In my experience, this is the definition of most feminists. It is what most feminists believe, and it is the definition which I myself have applied to my own politics.

In my experience, sex-positive feminism involves a lot of thinking about men and women as sexual beings. It is about trying to understand why men and women interact the way they do. It's about trying to understand the ways in which men are socialised to engage in sexual behaviour, and the ways in which women are socialised to be passive, or to be able to give and not get, or to be shut out of other people's sexual interests and desires. It's about trying to understand the ways in which men are culturally sexually objectified and sexually objectified women. It's about trying to understand why we are socialised to expect and desire sexual arousal from men, but not from women. It's about trying to understand why men are expected to be sexual and women not. And it's about trying to understand why men are expected to be sexual but not women. It's about trying to understand why we are sexual and not sexual, and why we have been sexual but not women.

Sex-positive feminism is, I think, a pretty straightforward approach to understanding how men and women function as sexual beings. It is very pragmatic, and it is particularly relevant to the fact that women are sexual objects. It is particularly relevant to the fact that we are socialised to expect and desire sexual arousal from men, but not from women, and to the fact that we are socialised to expect and desire sexual arousal from men, but not from women. Sex-positive feminism is about understanding how sexual objectification and sexual objectification of women involves a variety of different theories, and it is about understanding how sexual objectification and sexual objectification of men involves a variety of different theories. Sex-positive feminism is about understanding how sexual objectification and sexual objectification of men involves a variety of different theories, and it is about understanding how sexual objectification and sexual objectification of women involves a variety of different theories.

Sex-positive feminism is about trying to understand why men and women are socialised to engage in sexual behaviour, and how women are socialised to be passive, or to be shut out of other people's sexual interests and desires.

Sex-positive feminism is also a sound practical approach to the question of why men and women behave the way they do. I have seen it work everywhere from the sex-positive feminist sex movement, to the activist women's movement, to a radical feminist movement, to radical feminist sex activism.

In short, sex-positive feminism is about trying to understand the ways in which men and women function as sexual beings, and it is about trying to understand why men and women behave the way they do.

But it is not just about understanding men and women as sexual beings. Sex-positive feminism is also about understanding why men and women behave the way they do, about how they think about themselves and each other, about what they believe and are uncomfortable with, about how they behave towards other people, and about how they relate to society.

Sex-positive feminism is about trying to understand why men and women behave the way they do, about how they think about themselves and each other, about what they believe and are uncomfortable with, about how they behave towards other people, and about how they relate to society.

Sex-positive feminism is about trying to understand why men and women behave the way they do, about how they think about themselves and each other, about what they believe and are uncomfortable with, about how they behave towards other people, and about how they relate to society.

NEW YORK — A 16-year-old boy was arrested Saturday evening after threatening to kill a man in the Bronx, according to the police.

The boy, who is minors, was charged with criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, both felonies, police said.

The boy was at a Bronx park when he made the threat to the man, who is a neighbor, police said.

The man told police that he was walking his dog on the nearby West Side Highway about 7:40 p.m. when a man walked up to him and said, "You have a dog? What kind of dog? Where you from?"

The man told police that the boy then pulled out a black gun and pointed it at the man, who was walking his dog, police said.

The man then called 911 and called the boy's mother, who then called police.

The boy was taken into custody at the Bronx-Roosevelt Hospital Center.

He was being held in lieu of $10,000 bail.

The New York City Law Department said it could not release the boy's name because of his age. He is being held at an alternative detention facility.<|endoftext|>The US military's world-beating F-22 Raptor fighter jet is the most expensive weapons system ever built. But it's not getting any cheaper.

The Pentagon announced Wednesday that it's planning to buy 87 more F-22s — the same number the Air Force won't be using.

The F-22s are the most advanced planes built to date. They have been in use by the Air Force since 2002, when the US military first bought them.

Each F-22 costs about $80 million and can fly at twice the speed of sound — faster than any other aircraft in the world.

The F-22 was supposed to have been retired by now, but the Air Force refuses to do so, because the plane is so impressive.

"The F-22 is the most capable and advanced air superiority fighter aircraft in the world," Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement Wednesday.

"The F-22 is truly a game-changing aircraft that will save lives and make our airmen more effective and safer in the air."

The service wants to buy as many as 87 F-22s. The Air Force is already buying 78 F-22s; it's not clear how many it will buy in the future.

Last month, the Air Force announced it will buy up to 187 F-22s for as many as $1.5 billion.

All the F-22s in the Air Force fleet are manufactured by Lockheed Martin, which is the sole supplier of the plane. The F-22 program cost about $102 billion up front, plus another $19 billion to operate and support the planes.

Lockheed Martin has been working to speed up the production of more F-22s, but the Air Force has been slow to approve the new production plans.

Lockheed Martin has said it needs to ramp up the F-22 production line by about seven years to keep up with the Air Force's production schedule.

The F-22's production line has been operating at a breakneck pace since the program was first announced in 1997. But the pace has slowed since then, and production has fallen from its peak of 1,400 F-22s in 2007.

Lockheed Martin's F-22 program manager David Deptula said the company will continue to invest in the plane and continue to "meet or exceed" the authority's production targets.

"The F-22 continues to be the world's best air superiority fighter," he said in a statement Wednesday.

The F-22 is the most advanced plane built to date. It can fly faster than sound.

The F-22's speed is so fast, it can rival the speed of sound. The jet can fly at two times the speed of sound, or Mach 1.2 — faster than any other aircraft in the world.

It also has stealth technology, which allows it to remain undetected by radar.

The F-22 is so advanced it can be flown by only one pilot, who has to handle all weapon systems from the ground.

The Air Force says the F-22 is the most capable and advanced air superiority fighter aircraft in the world.

"The F-22 is truly a game-changing aircraft that will save lives and make our airmen more effective and safer in the air," said James.<|endoftext|>I have been told that when I write an article about "women in tech," it's often met with a slew of comments, some helpful, some hurtful, and some downright rude.

(CNN) The federal government has been spending up to $2 million a day to monitor protests in Ferguson, Missouri, where a grand jury has just announced it will not indict an officer in the death of Michael Brown.

But that money is not going toward public safety, but rather to the private security firms that have been hired to help police officers and others at the protests.

The Department of Homeland Security is providing $2.2 million in federal grants to the St. Louis County Police Department to pay for the services of the Tactical Response Team and the National Guard.

The grant, which is up to $2,000,000, went to the police department for the first six months, according to a police statement. It stops in September.

The amount spent in August, September and October on the operation has more than tripled, to more than $3.7 million, according to the statement.

The total cost of the policing operation is "still being determined," police said, but it includes "costs incurred by the St. Louis County Police Department, the Missouri Highway Patrol and the State Highway Patrol."

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The money is being used to provide "a variety of equipment and services, such as armored vehicles, helicopters, and other equipment."

The Times draws on a variety of sources to argue convincingly that the social club was a ritualistic form of place-making, a way of creating a place for itself that functioned as a "republic of its own." In order to understand this, it is important to understand the history of the social club.

The social club is perhaps the greatest invention of nineteenth-century New York. It was an invention of the city, not just of the people in it. It was a product of a particular time and a particular place, a town that was becoming the model city for others to follow. The social club had its origins in the early nineteenth century, when the city was a more homogenous place than it had been in previous centuries. The upper classes had been drawn to the city because it offered a wide variety of opportunities to meet as well as to socialize. As a result, many people were drawn to the city to be part of this social club. The social club grew as the city became more cosmopolitan, as the wealthy and the middle class began to move to the city from all over the country. The city's geography made it ideal for these people to live and work. The social club was a way to create a new venue for socializing. The social club functioned as a place where the upper class could meet in a more intimate way with the lower classes.

The social club was a powerful institution in the city throughout the nineteenth century. In the 1840s, it was the primary venue for socializing, and it was the primary means of meeting women, among other groups. It served as a meeting place for business and professional men who wanted to circulate information about lucrative opportunities. It served as a place where the upper and middle class socialized with the working class. The social club was a place where the middle and upper classes could meet in a more intimate way with the lower classes. The social club was a place where the upper class could meet in a more intimate way with the lower classes.

In the nineteenth century, the social club was a place where the upper class and the upper class were able to meet and socialize in a more formal and formal way. The social club was a way that the upper class could meet with the lower class and express their social superiority. It was a way that the upper and middle classes could meet with the lower classes and express their social inferiority. It was a way that middle and upper class men could meet with the working class, express their lack of social status, and indicate their desire to spend their time and their money on the working class. It was a way that the working class could meet with the upper class and express their social superiority.

By the 1880s, the social club had become the primary venue for socializing in New York. The social club served as a way for the upper class to meet with the lower class. The social club served as a way for the upper class to meet with the lower class. The social clubs functioned as venues for socializing in New York.

"We have to figure out how to increase the velocity of transactions, so the average time between a transaction and its confirmation is reduced."

- Thomas Voegtlin, CTO of Ripple Labs

The last time we spoke with Thomas Voegtlin, he was still a new employee at Ripple Labs, but had already earned a reputation for his work on Ripple and its XRP cryptocurrency.

Now, as Ripple Labs continues to grow, Voegtlin is taking on a new role: CTO.

"I'm taking on the role of CTO of the future of the blockchain," Voegtlin said in a recent interview. "I think the blockchain is going to be pretty big."

The former VP of Engineering at Coinapult, Voegtlin is now focusing on the future of blockchain technology and how it's going to change the role of banks in the world of financial transactions and payments.

Voegtlin says that the bitcoin blockchain has the potential to be the world's largest, but the protocol has a lot of limitations.

"There are certain limitations to the bitcoin blockchain," he said. "It's a big, slow network that's not designed to process very large transactions."

That's what Voegtlin is trying to change with Ripple Labs.

"We have to figure out how to increase the velocity of transactions, so the average time between a transaction and its confirmation is reduced," he explained.

Voegtlin says that the next step is to improve blockchain scalability, which is a key challenge for the technology.

The company has hired developers to help with this effort, and announced that it is building its own system based on the blockchain.

"The system is built on the blockchain but is built from the ground up to be a new system that does not have any known limitations," the company wrote in a blog post. "We are working to create an open source system that can be used by any blockchain project."

For now, Ripple Labs is working to improve its products and services, and work on the technology that will be used for its own blockchain.

"Ripple Labs is not going to be the world's biggest crypto company in five years," it said. "But we are going to be an important player in how the world uses digital currencies."<|endoftext|>The wife of the deputy who killed three people and injured others in a chase through West Memphis, Arkansas, on Thursday described the gunman as a "crazy person" who had been sent to jail for robbery and domestic violence.

The suspect, Brentley Vinson, was found dead after a foot chase with police in the town near the Texas border.

"He was a crazy person, and he would just pop out of nowhere," Mary Vinson, the suspect's wife, told KATV. "You just never knew what he was going to do."

She said her husband was in jail for a probation violation at the time of the shooting, and that he had been sent to prison for a robbery conviction.

"He had just been released a few days before," she said.

The suspect is also the father of the two children killed and injured in the incident. Mary Vinson said she was told that the shooter's daughter had taken her children to school that morning, but that he had not been home at the time.

"He was a good guy, and he won't be missed," she told the Associated Press.

Authorities said they were aware of the suspect's history with the law.

"We're currently in the process of trying to determine if he was on any other criminal records," said Capt. Kevin Bobo, with the West Memphis Police Department.

Vinson was being held on a charge of capital murder, according to KATV.

The manhunt for the suspect began just after midnight on Thursday when several police cars and K-9 units pulled over the suspected driver's car in a residential neighborhood in West Memphis and a gun battle ensued.

News footage showed police with their guns drawn chasing the suspect on foot and in a car before he was shot and killed. Officers recovered a rifle and a handgun from the scene and seized evidence.

The suspect's car was found riddled with bullet holes, according to a statement from the Arkansas State Police.

The police statement did not elaborate on the alleged motive.

"We're still looking to see why he was there," Bobo said.

The incident was the latest in a string of high-profile police shootings across the country.

For the last few months I have been working on some development tools for the Haskell ecosystem. I've landed my first binary product, yast2 , which allows you to transform the Haskell AST into a human readable, type-safe, and easy to use schema. There's a lot more to come, but the basic idea is simple: yast2 takes a Haskell AST, and transforms it into a schema that is easy to read and write, and does not require an external schema parser or parser combinator library.

I wanted to show off my work today, so I've released the Haskell package, yast2. The package is available on Hackage, and can be installed with cabal install yast2 .

I've been working on this for the last few months, and while I've been working on it I've also been working on the Haskell ecosystem at the GHC HQ. Last week I met with a group of people at the GHC HQ to discuss how to make it easier to develop packages for the Haskell ecosystem. My presentation and discussion with them was very inspiring, and I would like to share a few of the things that we discussed.

Documentation

One of the biggest concerns I've had with the Haskell ecosystem is the documentation. I've been in a position where I've tried to do a lot of documentation, and I don't think I've been successful. There are lots of packages on Hackage, and their documentation is scattered around the internet, which is really difficult to understand.

I've been working on a few things to help improve the documentation. The first step is to provide a centralized place for all of the Haskell packages that have documentation. We already have an online package index ( http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ ), but it's really not very well organised, and I would like it to be.

We need a central place for all of the documentation that exists, and I think that's one of the biggest hurdles. On the other hand, this is a great opportunity for other developers to submit documentation. There are lots of categories in the package index, and people are already submitting documentation to them.

The Haskell ecosystem is incredibly large, and it's really difficult to find all of the documentation that exists.

Building the package index

The first step is to make the package index more central. We have documentation, but it's scattered around the internet. Each package has its own index, and I would like to make sure that the documentation for all of the packages is available in one place.

When people look at the documentation for a package, they don't always know where to find it. The most common solution is that they have to search through the documentation for the package, and then search through the documentation for that category of documentation. Once they've found the documentation they want, they have to manually do a lot of work to find the documentation for that package. This is very time consuming.

I'm currently working on a wiki page that will help people find documentation for any Haskell package. When people look at the wiki page for a package, they will be able to see which categories of documentation it has, and then they will be able to find the documentation for that category of documentation.

I think that this is a great example of what I've called "deobfuscation". Some packages have documentation that is quite obfuscated. There is a lot of jargon in it, and it's hard to understand. If you're writing a library, you want to make sure that the documentation is easy to read.

A wiki page is a great way to deobfuscate the documentation, and make it easier to understand.

There are also many packages that have documentation that is very difficult to understand. If we have a wiki page for a package, people will be able to quickly find documentation for that package, and it will be much easier to understand.

Community

One of the most important parts of any package is the community around it. I think the best way to make sure that a package has a strong community is to make sure that people have a good way to contribute.

I've been working on a lot of different things at the Haskell HQ, and I have a particular interest in making documentation better. I think that making documentation better is one of the most important things that we can do to support the Haskell ecosystem. We need to make it easier to contribute documentation to the Haskell ecosystem.

One way that we can do this is by creating a package index that mirrors the documentation on Hackage. We already have an online package index ( http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ ), but it's not very well organised, and I think it's really difficult to understand.

We can already have a package index, but the problem is that it's only covering packages that are up on Hackage. There are also many packages that are not on Hackage.

But there is one more thing to be said about this book. I have read this book, and I have read it with a serious disappointment. The New Atheists is in my opinion a very bad book. And not just because it is bad, but because it panders to the worst kind of religious fanatics.

His chapters are filled with arrogant and racist statements about Muslims, and Christians, and Hindus, and Jews. He claims that there is a religious "religion" that has infected the world, and that the only way to destroy it is to destroy the ideas behind it. He says that Islam, the religion of the majority of the world's Muslims, is a "religion of hate" and "the most dangerous religion on earth." He says that the Christian religion is the "religion of white supremacy" and that it is "the most dangerous religion on earth." He says that Buddhism is "a religion of egoism and personal gain." He says that Hinduism is an "anti-science religion" and that its founder killed millions of people because he was a fanatical Hindu. He says that Judaism is "just a religion of covetousness," and that Islam is "a religion of revenge and war." He says that Buddhism is "a religion of egoism and personal gain," that Christianity is the "religion of white supremacy," that Islam is "evil," that Hinduism is "a religion of egoism and personal gain," and that Judaism is "a religion of covetousness." He says that Buddhism is "a religion of egoism and personal gain," that Christianity is "the religion of white supremacy," that Islam is "evil," that Hinduism is "a religion of egoism and personal gain," and that Judaism is "a religion of covetousness."

He claims that the only way to destroy Islam is to destroy its ideas. He says that modern Muslims, who are far more tolerant of other peoples than their ancestors, are "cockroaches." He says that the only way to destroy Christianity is to destroy its ideas. He says that modern Christians, who are far more tolerant of other peoples than their ancestors, are "cockroaches."

The New Atheists is the most dangerous book I have ever read. It is the worst book I have ever read. It is the worst book I have ever read for two reasons. One, it is full of racism. For example, he says that the Jews are the most violent people in history. He says that the Jews have been responsible for the deaths of "millions of people." He says that the Jews are the most evil people in the history of the world. And he says that the Jews are the biggest threat to world peace. The Jews are a threat to the world because they are "oppressors," "racists," "antisemites," "fanatics," and "terrorists."

Two, it is full of ignorance. He says that "the most important religious question of our time

The Wolfback, or the "Burgundy Bison", is a legendary figure in the Old West. He is the biggest mule in the history of the breed and a famed folk hero. The Wolfback became a symbol of the Old West and the Wild West, and was the key to the survival of the American West.

The first sightings of the Bison occurred in the early 19th century and were rarely seen. In 1858, a group of men traveling in the vicinity of Idaho Falls, Idaho, captured a bull and named it "The Wolfback". The name stuck.

In the spring of 1859, after a long journey between the Rocky Mountains and the Central Pacific Railroad, the Wolfback was brought to the San Francisco Stockyards. The Wolfback was shipped to the West and was promptly shot. The last Bison to be shot was at the San Francisco Stockyards in 1866. There are no records of a bull being killed at the Wolfback Ranch in California.

In 1872, the Bison was introduced into the United States. It was later admitted as a native American animal and was designated as a member of the Bison family. Other breeds of the Bison family include Bison, Irish Bison, Buffalo, and Warthog.

Today, the Wolfback is recognized as one of the most important American animals. He is known for his hearty endurance, strength, and ability to withstand harsh conditions of both the wild and the domestic environment. He was also considered as a symbol of the Old West.

Pre-release information Edit

The following article is a work in progress. Please be patient while it is being constructed.

This article has not yet been finished and checked to be accurate.

The following information is from a pre-release source and is not considered canon.

Star Wars: Rogue One: Scarif directed by Gareth Edwards and written by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy, starring Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Jiang Wen, Forest Whitaker, Alan Tudyk, Riz Ahmed, Jiang Wen, Forest Whitaker, Mads Mikkelsen, Donnie Yen, and Jiang Wen, is a film that will serve as the second installment of the Rogue One trilogy. The film is set for release on December 16, 2016.

Plot summary Edit

The film, directed by Gareth Edwards, tells the story of the characters who were killed during the battle between the First Order and the Resistance on Scarif, an Imperial-occupied planet. The film begins with a battle between a Resistance fleet and a First Order Star Destroyer over Scarif. The battle ends when the Star Destroyer fires a missile at the Resistance fleet, which destroys the ship.

Following the destruction of the Star Destroyer, the Resistance and the First Order rush to investigate the explosion. They find that the explosion was caused by a fighter squadron from the First Order nicknamed the "Bombers."

The film shows how these fighters are equipped, their weapons, their tactics, and how they are trained. The film also shows how the First Order reconstitutes the bombers in their new base on Scarif.

As the film progresses, we see how the bombers are used to destroy various buildings on the planet. These bombers are also used to attack the Resistance military base on Scarif.

The film, in my opinion, is the best installment of the series. The characters are interesting, the story is well-paced, and the action scenes are intense. The film also has a strong political subtext and is a good film that is well worth seeing.

Notes and references Edit<|endoftext|>The Seattle Seahawks are rolling along at the moment. They have a record of 5-1 and are currently the only unbeaten team in the league. They are also in the midst of a three-game winning streak.

But the Seahawks are not the only team making waves around the NFL.

The Denver Broncos and Oakland Raiders are also rolling their way towards 5-1 records, which means they are currently the only undefeated teams in the NFL.

Of the Steelers, Patriots, and Bengals, the Steelers are in the midst of their worst start to a season since the Steelers were a Super Bowl contender prior to the 1970 season.

However, their two losses came to the 3-2 Baltimore Ravens and the 3-3 Miami Dolphins in the first two weeks of the season, which means the Steelers are rolling right now.

The Patriots and Bengals are looking a little weaker than the Steelers, but they still have a chance to make a run at the playoffs.

Below are the five undefeated teams in the NFL, according to the NFL Power Rankings.

5. Denver Broncos

The Broncos are another team that has had a rough start to the season. They lost their first game to the Denver Broncos on opening day, but then bounced back with a win over the Saints on opening night.

However, they have dropped two straight games since, and their only win since has been against the Chiefs in the AFC Championship game.

The Broncos have a tough timetable to get things turned around. They have a game against the Kansas City Chiefs in two weeks on the road, but they have a matchup with the Patriots in Week 11, which could be a tough test in New England.

4. Pittsburgh Steelers

The Steelers have had a rough start to the season. They lost their first two games to the Baltimore Ravens and the Miami Dolphins.

The Steelers have not lost since, however, and they are currently the only undefeated team in the NFL. They have won three straight games and are now 8-0.

The Steelers have a tough schedule ahead of them, but they are 3-1 over the past three weeks and have a chance to win their first division title in the past two decades.

3. New England Patriots

The Patriots have had a rough start to the season. They lost their first game to the Baltimore Ravens on opening day, but then bounced back with a win over the Saints on opening night.

However, they have dropped two straight games since, and

I like to think of myself as a fairly tolerant Republican. I'm kind of a fiscal conservative, but I'm also a social conservative. I'm a little old-school when it comes to abortion rights, but I think gay marriage is an issue we can deal with over time. I'm a little old-school on religious freedom, which is why I see a lot of conservatives defending Hobby Lobby.

But as my daughter's birth control coverage was about to end, the Trump administration announced the end of the Obama-era rule requiring employers to cover birth control as part of their employees' health insurance.

The administration said the rule was an overreach of executive power, and it had been repealed on Thursday.

That's not true. It's still not true.

The Trump administration's executive order on the Affordable Care Act … has the potential to impact millions of women.

I am not kidding.

The order — which is still not legal — states that the federal government can't force anyone to provide coverage for birth control. There are no exceptions.

That means that no employer can be forced to provide health insurance coverage for birth control. And if he or she is, the employer is in violation of the law. There is no legal way to make an employer provide coverage for birth control without violating the law.

So if you are one of millions of women who is getting a letter from your insurance company saying you are having to pay more for birth control because of the Trump administration's order, you can sue the insurance company.

And it's not just women who could be affected. Many men who have access to birth control via their spouse's employer could also be affected. They can be sued, too, if their employer requires them to provide coverage.

What's more, the order could impact other kinds of preventive care. The government can't force you to get a flu shot or be screened for cancer. But the Trump administration can force you to get a prescription for birth control.

The administration can't force you to get a flu shot or be screened for cancer. But the Trump administration can force you to get a prescription for birth control.

The order could also impact other preventive care. The government can't force you to get a flu shot or be screened for cancer. But the Trump administration can force you to get a prescription for birth control.

If you think the Trump administration is going to use this to roll back women's rights, you're right. But there are ways that you can fight back.

First, get a copy of the order. You can find it online at the Federal Register.

You can also call your insurance company and let them know you are getting this letter. You don't have to say why — just let them know you are getting this letter.

You can also call your state insurance department and let them know you are getting this letter. You don't have to say why — just let them know you are getting this letter.

And, if you know of any employers who are still providing coverage for birth control, you can report them to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

The Trump administration has an opportunity to do something great for women. But they're choosing to abuse it.<|endoftext|>About

I'm a computer programmer who found his way into the world of music software.

I've been a musician for over 20 years and have been producing music professionally since 2004. I've written over 30 songs in that time with over a dozen more in the works. I've recorded an EP in 2010 and a full length album in 2011.

I'm primarily a composer and arranger but recently made the jump from composition to music software as well. With the help of my employer I'm able to pay my bills, fund a few personal projects and play music in my free time.

I've always had a passion for music and have been writing music since I was a child. I've always been very involved with musicians, creating music for bands and other musicians I've met over the years.

My goal is to be able to produce my own music. I've been working on this project for a while but need your help to get it out to the world.

The music is playing in the background

This is a passionate project that will take a lot of time, effort and money. As much as I would like to be able to devote myself to this project full time I just can't do it. I'm still trying to figure out how to make ends meet and will need to make some sacrifices in order to do this job.

Here is a list of what you can expect from my project:

I had just finished watching the prequels and I was shellshocked by all the terrible writing, acting and editing. It's not that I didn't love the movies, but I had a much different opinion of them. I didn't feel like they were thought through or well-crafted, but rather rushed and hurried through. The final product came off as rushed and rushed. This film was different.

I was excited to see the film and watch it again. I wanted to see how they changed what they created and how they had changed it. The film was a bit of a let down for me, but I was excited for the second time around. I was so excited that I nearly cried when I saw the final product. I thought, "Oh my god, they made it so much better." I'm going to be honest with you, I was so excited for the sequel. I really like the second film, but I'm a bit disappointed in the first. I thought it was a better product overall, but it was still pretty bad.

I've seen a lot of the criticism surrounding the film. Some people say that the film is too dark. Some people say that it's too soft. Some people say that the film is boring. I am not here to defend the film. I am here to say that I think that the film is a great film. I think it's well thought out and well-made. It's a great piece of art.

The film is centered around the young Luke Skywalker. The film really shows off the young Luke. He's the protagonist of the film. I think this is a great way to introduce the character. It gives us a chance to really see what he's like when he's young and has become a Jedi. It gives us a chance to see what he's like when he has lost his father. It gives us a chance to see what he's like when he's lost his mother. It gives us a chance to see what he's like when he's lost his friends. He has a lot of friends. It's a really wonderful way to introduce the character and give us a break from the prequels.

The film also does a great job of weaving a story that is about how Luke is going to have to deal with the fact that he's the son of Anakin Skywalker and Princess Leia. It's a great way to introduce the character and really build up his character.

The film also has a strong villain. It's really interesting to see how the villain is going to be introduced. We are already taken to see that the Sith are going to be involved. There are two of them. We are introduced to Darth Maul as well. He's a really interesting villain.

The film also has a strong focus on the Force. Luke Skywalker is more than just a Jedi. He's a Jedi who has become a Force user. He's a Jedi who has begun to understand the Force. He's going to have to deal with some issues that come with that.

The film also has a strong focus on Han Solo and Chewbacca. They're not just there to be droids or cannon fodder. They're there to play important roles in the film.

The film has a strong focus on the Force and how Luke is going to have to deal with it.

The world's top three auto makers — General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles — have joined the United Auto Workers bargaining team for a new four-year contract.

The UAW said Thursday that the companies had agreed to terms for a new contract that, if ratified by the union, would begin Jan. 15, with the first day of work scheduled for Feb. 12.

The new contract would be the third for the Detroit Three, which are also the largest private employers in the U.S. The new contract would also be the first for Chrysler, which is facing a potential bankruptcy.

GM (GM) said Thursday it signed a new, four-year contract with the UAW.

"We are pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with the Union representing our UAW Team Members on new contract terms," GM said in a statement. "We have made significant progress in the negotiations and we look forward to ongoing discussions to drive value and build a stronger team in the next contract."

Ford (F) said Thursday it reached an agreement with the union that would begin on Jan. 1, with the first day of work scheduled for Feb. 12. The automaker is facing several challenges as it tries to turn around its business after it broke its lease with the UAW in 2011. Ford has seen its share of the U.S. car market shrink more than 10 percentage points since 2011, and filed for bankruptcy protection in January.

"We are pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with the Union representing our UAW Team Members on new contract terms," Ford said in a statement. "We have made significant progress in the negotiations and we look forward to ongoing discussions to drive value and build a stronger team in the next contract."

The UAW said that the auto makers made their best offer, adding that the companies were making significant progress in the negotiations.

"We were able to come to a good agreement that addresses our key concerns and will keep our team members employed in the UAW-represented plants," said UAW President Dennis Williams. "We are pleased to be moving forward with a new contract with our two biggest auto competitors."

The new contract would replace the tentative agreement that expired in August, with both sides saying they were "not far apart." The previous contract expired on Dec. 31.

The UAW said that the companies would keep their current health care benefits, including health care for senior employees, and would continue to pay all employee contributions to pension plans.

The companies said the new contract would be "consistent with the UAW's long-term goal of putting more money in the pockets of our workers."

The UAW has been in contract talks with the companies for more than a year and has been facing a strong push from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other businesses to keep wages stagnant. The UAW has resisted the push, saying that it will not give in to anti-union forces.

The UAW has also been facing a backlash from some U.S. Fiat Chrysler workers who have walked out of the company's plants.

The companies said that the new contract would "preserve the ongoing role of the Teamsters Local 708 Bargaining Unit as the bargaining unit for the new UAW contract."

"With the addition of the new Teamsters Local 708 bargaining unit, we are pleased to bring to the table a union representing the best of the best in the industry," said Fiat Chrysler spokesman Ray Holt. "We look forward to making a strong and competitive offer to our Teamsters Team Members on Jan. 1 and Feb. 12."

The companies said that they are committed to keeping the new UAW contract "as competitive as possible."

The UAW has said that it is willing to negotiate a new contract that includes a wage increase in the new contract, but offers no details about the amount.

According to the study, which was conducted in 2013, whites were six times more likely to be killed by a law enforcement officer than black Americans.

"White Americans are more likely than blacks to be involved in violent crime, but they are less likely to be involved in lethal force incidents," the study said. "The analysis found that, compared with black Americans, white Americans were over 10 times more likely to be involved in fatal force incidents, four times more likely to be involved in nonfatal force incidents, and more than twice as likely to be involved in property crime incidents."

As a strong economy, Italy is renowned for its innovation and has developed a number of key innovations. These include the smartphone, the car industry, and informal banking.

However, Italy's most important innovation, the car industry, has been highly volatile, with a number of companies and governments having failed to adapt to the evolution.

The car industry's innovative potential has been driven by the ability to establish and maintain a 'car culture', which encourages innovation and can be considered a solution to the problem of innovation in the car industry. This culture has been built on several pillars:

the car industry needs to be agile and adaptable to the new technologies that are emerging in the market;

the car industry needs to be competitive by aiming at a low cost and high quality;

the car industry needs to be efficient by focusing on the services and technologies that make the car an efficient and convenient transport device;

the car industry needs to be innovative in order to become more efficient and competitive, and generate new products and services;

The car industry needs to be financially secure by focussing on the production of high quality products and services, as well as by encouraging innovation and competition which will generate new products and services.

The car industry has been able to play a key role in Italy's economic success, with the industry being responsible for more than 40% of the country's GDP. The car industry has also helped to support the Italian economy by providing jobs, jobs, jobs.

The car industry has been the driving force behind Italy's innovation, and has produced several key innovations.

This is the year the world is divided. At the center of the war is a young woman who has just lost her father. Noriko Shikage, known universally as Matoi, is a super-powered girl who fights against a shadowy presence. The shadow is the Organization's leader, its true identity a mystery to even most of its members.

Shikage, with her powers of "Heavenly Wind" and "Mountain Reversal," is the sole hope of the world. Her powers allow her to reach into the other world. She can see things she normally can't.

I've been using it with a single USB-C cable for the entire year, but now that Google has released the Pixel C, I want to move to using a USB-C cable with every device I own.

I've been using it with a single USB-C cable for the entire year, and now that Google has released the Pixel C, I want to move to using a USB-C cable with every device I own.

But what about those cases, the new cases, that I've been looking at when I think about buying a new case? I have no problem using a USB-C cable with any case when I'm using my Pixel C, but what about when I use a case with my old Nexus 7 tablet?

USB-C is still the standard

The USB-A connector on my old Nexus 7 tablet is still covered with Gorilla Glass 4, so I can't really tell the difference between the new Pixel C and a Nexus 7 tablet. The Pixel C is also still covered with Gorilla Glass 4, so I can't really tell the difference between the new Pixel C and a Nexus 7 tablet.

The new Pixel C is also still covered with Gorilla Glass 4, so I can't really tell the difference between the new Pixel C and a Nexus 7 tablet.

One of the biggest differences between the old Nexus 7 and the new Pixel C is the way the two cases are designed. The old Nexus 7 had a magnetic charging dock that would stick to the back of the phone, so I couldn't simply put the new Pixel C on the charging dock and charge it at the same time. I had to remove the dock and put it on the new Pixel C.

This isn't a huge problem, because I already have a charging dock in my pocket, but it's a bit of a hassle when I'm trying to charge my new Pixel C tablet.

The new case design

The new Pixel C and the new Nexus 7 tablet are both designed so that you can put them on the magnetic charging dock. This means that you can put the new Pixel C on the charging dock and charge it at the same time.

Chapter Two: The Green Dragon

She was a fine warrior, but still she was a beast.

The first thing she noticed was how fast she was, her pace was incredible. Once she realized that, she realized that she had to get away.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry…" She kept on crying, but she didn't know how to say it.

She was a beast, and she was attacking a human with her human instincts.

On the other hand, she was a beautiful girl.

He was already looking, to see if he could find a weapon to fight her.

"What am I, a human?" she shouted.

"You're a beast, you're a beast, you're a beast!" he shouted back.

"I'm a human!" she screamed, a little bit of anger was still in her voice.

"I'm not a human, I'm a beast, you're a beast, you're a beast!" he screamed back.

Suddenly, she noticed something, she realized that he was wearing a cloak, and a mask, and he was looking at something that was on the ground.

She couldn't see it, but she saw a mask that she had once seen before.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry…" she said.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry…"

He was apologizing.

When she was done apologizing, she walked right in front of him, and put her hands on his shoulders.

"Please, leave this place." she said.

He didn't move.

She continued to put her hands on his shoulders, until her arms were covered in his.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry…"

She tried to stop, but she was stopped.

She was crying, but she didn't know how to stop.

He looked at her, and his eyes were calm.

He was still looking at something on the ground.

Suddenly, he looked at her face.

He looked at her and smiled.

She didn't know how she felt, but she had a feeling that something was happening.

"My name is Creighton, I'm a traveling merchant, I came here to find a dragon." he said.

She looked at him and her eyes were filled with shock.

She was in shock, she never thought a human could say such a thing.

"My name is Diana, I am a member of the human race." she said.

He smiled, and said, "Very well, I will be leaving now."

"Wait." she said.

He looked at her, and said, "What?"

She looked at him for a second, and then she smiled, and said, "I know you're not a dragon, but I'm telling you, you're my friend, and you're a total jerk. I'm asking you to be my friend, I don't want to be your enemy, but I'm not going to be friends with a jerk like you."

He looked at her, and smiled.

"I'm not going to fight you, but I'm going to call you by your name, Diana. My friend." he said.

"Thank you." she said.

"I don't think there is much of a point to this. I'm going to go." he said.

"Wait…" she said.

He frowned, then he looked at her, and smiled.

"You know, I don't think there is anything strange about you, Diana." he said.

She looked at him, and her eyes were filled with sadness, but she said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry…"

He smiled again, and said, "I don't think there is anything strange about it either, we all have our flaws, but we're all people."

She said, "I guess I'm just a bit sad."

He smiled, and said, "Good, that means you're my friend."

She smiled, but she didn't know what to say.

She was feeling a little sad, but she knew she was just a little sad.

He looked at her again, and said, "I'm going to call you by your name again, Diana, my friend."

"Thank you." she said.

He looked at her, and smiled.

The Oceanside City Council votes to credit residents who help reduce carbon pollution by installing green roofs on their homes. Oceanside is the first city in California to do this.

A majority of the City Council voted Tuesday night to give residents of Oceanside credit for installing green roofs on their homes. This move can reduce greenhouse gases by about 7,000 tons a year, or about 40 percent of the city's total emissions.

"We're sending a message to the rest of the world that we're serious about being a leader in clean energy," said Mayor William Meyer.

Oceanside is the first city in California to take this step.

Oceanside's program is modeled on a program in Cambridge, Mass. In Cambridge, residents who help reduce carbon pollution by installing green roofs receive financial incentives. Since 2014, the program has saved the city about $94,000 a year.

"If you look at the benefit and the cost, they're really, really good values," said Lisa Anderson, a policy analyst with the Environment California Research and Policy Center. "The green roofs are the best thing that the city could do to help the environment."

The Oceanside program will be available to residents of the city as long as they meet certain requirements. It will cover all roofs on homes built after February 2010. It will be available for a three-year period, and the program will be monitored by the city.

"We're trying to move towards a green future, and we're trying to do it in our own backyard," said Councilman Mark Potts.

The city will consider extending the program to other neighborhoods if they can show they're also reducing emissions.

Residents who want to help the program find homes that meet the requirements can call (760) 953-9170 or visit oceanside.com.

The exchange is difficult to make out

Government officials seem to be a bit embarrassed

NEW YORK (AP) — A BBC reporter captured an awkward exchange between the government of Iran and the broadcaster's cameraman on Thursday, and the exchange is difficult to make out.

CNN's Michael Weiss posted a photo of the exchange on Twitter. Gupta, who was on a live broadcast in Tehran, initially recorded the exchange at the airport.

In the recording, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, speaks into a microphone as Gupta speaks into her camera.

"I cannot help but feel that you are in an old-fashioned era," he says. "In the 21st century, in the age of smartphones, people have got their own personal information, I wonder what your purpose is here."

Gupta responds: "I just want to note that the leader of this great country, Mr. Rouhani, has just called us a great nation. He has said we are a great nation. I'm sure you will say that again."

"Yes, I think so," the official replies.

The exchange is difficult to make out.

Gupta said Friday that she couldn't make out the words because she was distracted by what she was saying in English.

"For the first time in my career, I did not speak the proper word," she said.

She said she didn't know why she was speaking in English.

"I suspect that it might be because I am an Indian, and I am used to speaking in English," Gupta said. "And I've always felt comfortable with it. I'm used to speaking in English. It's been an easy transition for me."

Alexei Moiseev, a spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, said the exchange was recorded in the context of the official meeting between the two officials.

"We are aware of the exchange of images by journalists during the meeting between the officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the BBC journalists," Moiseev said. "The Iranian government is aware of the incident and is conducting an investigation in this regard."

The government of Iran announced Friday that Rouhani, the country's president, would be visiting the United States.

The visit will be his first to the nation since the 2009 election.

Gupta said she was concerned that the government wouldn't be welcoming Rouhani, who was seen by many in the West as a reformer.

"I'm very concerned that he might be very cold and stiff and not be very easy to talk to," she said.

"The Dirty Dozen" is a food pyramid designed to help Americans understand what to eat, what to avoid, and what to eat more of. The original pyramid was created by the government in the 1950s, but it was quickly dubbed "The Dirty Dozen" by the media and the public.

As the debate over the future of religion in America rages, a new poll finds that most Americans accept of atheists who want to run for office.

A new poll by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) finds that 63 percent of Americans say they believe "atheists who want to run for office should be allowed to do so," while only 32 percent said they "dissent from this statement."

The poll surveyed 1,451 adults nationwide from June 2 to 5.

The poll also found that only 27 percent of Americans say they "ever think of themselves as being religious."

The PRRI poll also found that 62 percent of Americans believe that "atheists who want to run for office should have the same rights as religious people."

The poll was conducted before the Supreme Court's decision on the Hobby Lobby case. In that decision, the court ruled that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993, "which has been used by a number of states to regulate private employers' rights to provide contraceptive coverage to their workers, should be interpreted to include the rights of people and businesses to exercise their own religious beliefs."

The Hobby Lobby decision, along with other recent decisions, have triggered a growing movement to allow atheists to run for office. This is the first time PRRI has surveyed this issue.

"Americans have a choice in this election cycle to stand on the side of the Constitution or the culture war," said PRRI President Robert P. Jones. "We are seeing a backlash against the culture wars and a movement toward constitutionalism. We are seeing a strong movement of Americans who are rejecting the religious right and embracing a more secular America."

The Hobby Lobby ruling has also sparked a new atheism movement. Last year, the Reason Rally in Washington D.C. drew an estimated crowd of 50,000 atheists and agnostics.

Rabbi Ari Berman of the New York City-based Agudath Israel of America, who spoke at the Reason Rally, says the religious right is losing its power.

"The conservative movement is losing its power, and the more they try to suppress the voices of reason and reason, the louder they are, and the more it forces people to hear what's going on and to think, 'Okay, I've thought about it, and that's not true, and I'm not alone,'" Berman said.

Meanwhile, the percentage of the U.S. population that describe themselves as religiously unaffiliated has risen from 8.2 percent in 2007 to 14.3 percent today.

"I think religious people are losing the cultural argument and losing the political argument," Berman said. "I think people are becoming more and more anti-religious, and that's by design."

The poll also found that Americans are also becoming more accepting of atheists running for office.

"Americans are willing to give atheists the same rights that religious people have, including the right to run for office," said P.J. O'Rourke, PRRI's vice president for research. "The American public is moving away from the idea that religion is a good influence in our society and looks at it more as a bad influence. They're saying we don't think religious people should have special rights, that's what we're saying."

The poll surveyed 1,451 adults nationwide from June 2 to 5. This poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percent.

LONDON - There is no health risk from contact with mosquitoes in the UK, the World Health Organization said Monday (Sept 6).

The WHO said there is a risk from mosquitoes carrying dengue fever, but that there is no evidence of any risk from the Zika virus.

The WHO said it will not recommend a travel ban on the part of countries affected by Zika.

Zika was first discovered in Uganda in the 1940s and is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.

The WHO said in a statement: "Currently, there is no evidence of an increased risk for the UK of Zika virus transmission from infected travelers who return from/to countries with widespread Zika virus transmission.

"There is also no evidence of an increased risk from the Zika virus in the UK as a result of mosquito bites from infected individuals.

"In addition, the risk from mosquitoes is low in the UK due to the absence of breeding sites and the presence of an effective vector control programme, which is supported by the mosquito control sector."

The UK is part of a group of countries known as the European region that are affected by the mosquito-borne Zika virus, the WHO said.

The WHO said it is advising pregnant women to avoid travel to areas with Zika virus transmission, and pregnant women should consider postponing travel to affected areas until at least two weeks before the expected date of delivery.

For people who have travelled to Zika-affected countries, the WHO said: "Information to help persons manage the risk of Zika virus infection is available online at: http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/Zika-affected-countries.htm."

The WHO has set up an emergency committee, involving medical specialists from the WHO and other international health organisations, to coordinate response by countries affected by Zika.

The European Union has said it will ban imports of mosquito-borne products from affected countries.

The WHO said its emergency committee will meet on Monday in Geneva, Switzerland.

It will discuss the evidence and determine the minimum required level of risk to public health in the European region, which includes the UK.<|endoftext|>A report by the U.S. Census Bureau says the median household income in the United States is $56,657. The same report says that the poverty rate is 14.6 percent. The Census Bureau report, however, is based on the most recent data from the most recent year available.

The poverty rate in America differs from the U.S. Census Bureau's report. The Census Bureau report calculates poverty based on the median income of families in the U.S. The poverty rate does not take into account the multi-generational nature of many families. The Census Bureau's report, on the other hand, calculates poverty based on the most recent data available.

The most recent poverty data from the Census Bureau is from the 2014 Income and Poverty report. The report includes data from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The poverty rate in the U.S. was 15.1 percent in 2014, according to the report.

Our parents, teachers, friends, and even strangers—even though they may not know us as well—are all very well-intentioned and well-intentioned people. They want the best for us. They want us to be happy. And they do want us to be safe and happy.

But there is a difference between "love" and "hate."

If you have problems with autism, you are not an "evil person." You are not "bad." You are not "bad" because of your autism. You are not a "bad person" because you are autistic.

You are a person. And just because you are autistic does not make you "Bad." It does not make you "bad." It doesn't make you "weak" or "bad."

And it certainly doesn't make you "mean."

If you're only "bad" because you are autistic does not mean you're a "bad person." It doesn't mean you don't deserve love. It doesn't mean you don't deserve love. It doesn't mean you don't deserve love. It doesn't mean you don't deserve love.

So don't tell me how I'm "bad" for being autistic.

I'm not.

I'm not "bad" because I'm autistic.

I'm not "bad" because I'm autistic.

I'm not "bad" because I'm autistic.

I want to use my Raspberry Pi as a simple web server. I know the basics of the basics but I can't seem to figure it out how to get it running.

Here's my setup:

Raspberry Pi

Raspbian Wheezy

HTTP Server

MySQL Server

Nginx Server

Raspbian is a Debian based distribution that is generally thought of as a Linux distribution.

If you don't know much about Debian it's a distribution that's based on Debian Wheezy (which is a Linux distribution that uses Debian as its base).

I'm using Debian Wheezy as it's my preferred distribution. If you have to choose between Debian and Ubuntu you should use Debian.

MySQL is a relational database that is commonly used for web development. It stores information in tables that represent the site's information.

MySQL Server is a free, open source, scalable database management system that provides a full-text search and indexing capability to MySQL databases.

Nginx is a webserver that allows you to serve static web pages (HTML) and dynamic web pages (JS) at the same time.

I know that you can set up your server to run Nginx as a reverse proxy, but I really don't want that. I have other projects that I want to run that require more server activity.

I'm using Nginx to serve static web pages. For static web pages you can use Apache to serve static web pages.

You can follow the steps below to set up a basic Apache web server and MySQL server to run a simple web server on your Raspberry Pi.

Note: Please be aware that you should only proceed with the steps below if you have a working internet connection. If you're unable to access the internet, do not proceed with the steps below. If you're using a Mac and don't have a local connection, you can follow the steps below using Mac OS X.

Step 1: Run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade to install the latest version of the Raspbian operating system.

Step 2: Download and Install Nginx

1. Click the "Download ZIP" button on the right side of the screen.

2. Download the Nginx software.

3. Extract the Nginx software to a folder on your Raspberry Pi's SD card.

4. Run sudo apt-get install nginx to install the Nginx software.

5. Download the Nginx configuration file and place it in the Nginx folder you created in step 1.

6. Run sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default and change the following line to reflect the following command:

# Add a 127.0.0.1 server block

server {

listen 80;

server_name your_server_name;
