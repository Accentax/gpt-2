Prior to Flight We will start by introducing you to your airplane. This will include walking around the plane and talking about various parts, why they're there, and how they work. After our walk around we will take a look inside the airplane. You will notice what will seem like a lot

, and what will become much less. These first few flights will be very basic: Takeoff and Takeoff/Departure Check. Start by flying the airplane with nothing in the way. You will take off with the prop, pull the power up, and pull the nose down to about 10 or 11 degrees of dive. Don't worry if you can't get this down 100%. It will all become less, as you become more experienced in the airplane. We suggest you do this with the landing gear down, with the engines off, and with the speed up. Once you are comfortable with the handling and flight capabilities of the airplane, take the airplane for a fly around. This will be a great opportunity to familiarize yourself with your new airplane. Once it's flying well, move on to the take off checklist: Takeoff Checklist (5 min). You may begin this checklist at any point during the flight or immediately upon takeoff. If you use this checklist, you may notice that there is not a single 'No' for this item. The 'no' is because we are trying to make sure you understand what the airplane is capable of and why you're flying it. We would also like to take the time to tell you, that no other item will be addressed in the same level of detail in this checklist. The reason for this isn't to make you feel stupid. The reason for this is so that you can understand and feel comfortable flying your airplane.

Fly around to the point where you think there may be a deficiency in the airplane, or you feel you might. We would expect you to fly out this checklist at least 20 times if you are just starting out. If you feel you have learned everything there is to know about the airplane, continue flying. But if you are not sure, you can always go back to these points to make sure there was no deficiency.

Fly around to the point where you think there may be a deficiency in the airplane, or you feel you might.

 of small things and there will be a lot of information that will need to be explained. This will not last long though! After getting familiar with the airplane we are ready to begin the Flight itself. After your first flight and getting through a few of the things you need to learn, the next step will be to get through the checkride! To do this you'll need to be logged in to your Flight Simulator. Click here to learn how to log in to the Flight Simulator. After logging in, you will need to have a few lessons under your belt. You will need to go through about 10 lessons total. After all the lessons have been done you will get to take the first Flight Test. The Checkride will be done in a few weeks after the Flight test. We will do a few short lessons for a test check. It is good to make sure you know every little detail about your airplane so you are ready to move onto Flight Testing.

Once you have been logged in and passed your checkride, it is time to earn your Private Pilot Certificate. You have completed 4 lessons of learning, that are the 4 things that it says to have done. From here on you will work through the rest of the program until you have earned your private pilot certificate.

Note: Flight Academy will be contacting you about getting your private pilot permit and medical. The flight training has completed at this point. It's just a matter of scheduling the medical to be in time for your next flight! There is a chance your Private Pilot Certification will be delayed. We understand how frustrating this can be for all the students. We have to make sure you are fully prepared for the first flight, and that you have gotten through the flight school and Flight Test procedures so we will keep it as low as possible on this one. In future years, as we grow this can be expected to last less than a couple weeks. Before you complete your flight test, you will have your ground instruction. This is to give you the opportunity to practice flying in various conditions and situations. During your test there may be times where you are given "Flight Tests Only" with a few instruction. If that happens to you, you may want to try and get additional information on your flight test to make sure you have got everything correct. The course is not a complete flight simulator experience, but it is a good introduction to flight. It does contain some other things that may be beneficial such as an instructor helping you to learn the various controls for your airplanes, and an instructor will occasionally come through the classroom checking on you and making sure you are flying properly. It's good to try and get some in-depth instruction on some of the different instruments and gauges available. For a detailed overview of the Flight Test schedule, Click Here

What does Flight Training cost? Your Flight Training course will cost $399.99. This was our base cost and the price for most of our students. We did add some extras for additional passengers. A passenger seat at the Private Pilot level costs $500 extra but it does reduce the price to $399.99. Our students have chosen our program because they love it! Here are a few reasons why: It's the only school that offers multiple airplanes, we always have the oldest and newest ones on hand.

It's one of the few flight schools that actually provides instruction without computers, it's amazing what you can do.

The instructors are knowledgeable and passionate about safety and airframes.

Our flight instructors have been in the aviation industry before and know their stuff.

 of different parts and systems: Engine - This part looks like the large metal block that the prop plane needs to spin up. It's also called a prop-drive engine – and basically it's an engine where propulsive force is produced by a flywheel underneath. There are a variety of prop-drive engines so be sure to select the correct one for your plane.

The engine also has various controls that we'll be using to operate the airplane.

If you'd like to see a basic overview of what makes up an engine, you can go back and check out our Engine Checkout.

Wing - This little wing is attached directly to the engine and it holds the airplane's lift.

The wing has a large diameter and is used for aerobatic maneuvers.

You will find a lot of different types of wing covers in flight school but we recommend getting a wing so you have something to help the airplane keep level. Once you have seen an airplane in motion we will move outside of the airplane, take a look at what we are in for, and review the flight review we planned earlier. Flight Review - This is your chance to observe how your airplane is flying so far. We'll introduce you to the various controls, how the airplane handles in certain situations, and some of the maneuvers we will be flying once we get home. From here we will review the lessons we've already done, check the Flight Schedule, and review the flight review that we plan to do next. The Flight Review We also plan to go over some of the safety rules in a flight review, so if you do not understand a given rule, be sure to ask us or another instructor when the review will take place. You will find some important rules in our Flight Review, and they will be listed here: Flight review rules - Check your Flight Schedule.

- Check your Flight Schedule. Flight Review Rules - Make sure you're logged in to your Flight Scheduling System with the same email address you'd use to log in to the FBO.

- Make sure you're logged in to your Flight Scheduling System with the same email address you'd use to log in to the FBO. Time Limit - When you are finished with the Flight Review, it is best to log back on to your Flight Scheduling System to check to see if you can schedule another lesson with the flight instructor you are flying with. Your lesson will always be scheduled two weeks after the Flight Review, because we want you to be ready for your next lesson as quickly as possible!

You can also log into your flight scheduler with your FBO username and password.<|endoftext|>HexaBot

It's about the next time you find yourself lost on a dark road, or you just want to have a laugh, and don't want to think about anything.

For those days when you don't feel like reading another article about "how to install hexaBot" or "how to use hexaBot" or "how to make an hexaBot" or any of the other questions and topics that I write about here - here, you have something else:

HexaBot with code in a file hexabots.sh !

Hexabot with code in a file that you can run

And the only thing you need is a hexaBot, and an Arduino! Hexabot is a great example of how to use a standard Arduino code, and use the Arduino language to talk to an Arduino. Here's a video demo of the HexaBot, and here's a video demo of hexabot with code in text, so you can make it do anything.

 of different parts but they all fit together to make up the airplane. You will learn to work your pedals, push the handles, and much more.


If it's your first time flying, we will be a gentle introduction to everything with you flying the airplane (as it was delivered). When we show you the airplane you will learn how you get in it, where everything is located, why it was designed, and how it all works. At this point you'll be starting to become familiar with the plane, which you should be able to do right after landing. This is the time in which you will have the best chance at flying at the same time, making it a valuable experience. During first few flights, you will be learning the best way to control a heavy airplane, which is what is required for the first flights.


You will need to learn to control this airplane as an all pilot crew (Ace Pilot's for you!). This will be no easy task! The more you practice, the more confident you will become. After a few weeks, you will be ready to fly. When you feel comfortable with flying, you are still learning so there is still plenty more to learn, but we encourage you to practice and take your time flying. We recommend flying in three different regions of the US, just to really get a feel for where the airplane is used. After practicing several flights, you can move on to flying larger airplanes. These days you can find them all in the same airport. So start with the easy ones and move on up!


Your First Flight! When you are ready for your first flight, you will pick a location to practice that you are able to fly from. When we are flying from California, we will be flying from LAX. This allows you to fly out of the LAX airport. When the weather is suitable for flight, you can fly from various airports, including LAX.


Once you are in the air we'll help you get settled in and let you practice.


On Your First Flight! Once you are ready to fly, you will need to fly the airplane to your chosen location. We'll help you get in the right position so your airplane will roll (or pitch) with the air in front of it by moving your control stick. You can then find your cruising altitude - altitude above you that is where you want to fly. Once you are comfortable flying, we will let you set your flight plan and let you know that you'll fly around the field (or area around the field). The most useful thing to do here is to have your airplane set for the minimum flight speed/range and then start flying. There are a few things we recommend you always do at the beginning of your flight: First off, check your instruments, listen carefully, look around, keep an eye out for things, etc. Also: You want the plane to be level! We'll give you your airplane, a set of instruments, and some notes on what to look out for.


What Will I Do on My First Flight? You'll have an opportunity to fly from the first time. Here is a listing of things you can do during your first time (the rest of the time is learning)


1. Get in the airplane. This is a good opportunity to learn everything it does and to practice using your pedals to fly a heavier airplane.


2. Put on your headset (this is a pair of ear buds). You'll be in the cockpit.


3. Let you see your instrument panel. This can be done with a magnifier or just holding onto your seat.


4. Check your throttle and trim tab (this is the toggle switch you should check for when you pull your seat back).

"Anybody who says that the recent election is not, at least in part, a racial event is functioning as an apologist, whether they know it or not, for white prejudice," says, Joseph Ellis, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian.

There are abundant examples of Trump's explicit racist statements. He didn't campaign in dog whistles; he used a bullhorn. He once called Mexican immigrants "rapists" and proposed a travel ban on all Muslims entering the United States. Even Republican House leader Paul Ryan once said Trump's comment that a federal judge couldn't do his job because of his Mexican heritage was "the textbook definition of a racist comment."

Trump's rise to political prominence was driven in part by a conspiracy theory coated in racism.

Trump led the "birther" movement that repeatedly implied Obama was an illegitimate president who was not born in the United States.

" (or "blackey") to white men in order to enter white-run hotels, restaurants and stores. Trump also called for a database that track Muslims and his call for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States," according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). The SPLC has said the Trump campaign had no official ties to the racists, but many of its members did volunteer on his presidential campaign.

The SPLC also recorded his racist statements. In November 2015, a week after announcing his candidacy, he described Mexican immigrants in lewd terms. "They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people," he said in a speech about his proposed border wall in Arizona. Later that month, in an interview with The Washington Post's editorial board, Trump called for a temporary ban "on all Muslims entering the United States." When another journalist referenced the SPLC, Trump went further, saying, "I'm going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had for 10 years, when anybody came into our country."

Trump also promised to resurrect the KKK. When the SPLC issued a report highlighting the hate group's resurgence, he released a statement saying the group had been "exterminated and destroyed."

Trump's comments about the Latino heritage of Gonzalo Curiel, the presiding judge in Trump University's class action suit, have been especially inflammatory. Trump said Curiel, who was born in East Chicago, Indiana, was biased from Mexico and couldn't fairly preside over the case because of his Mexican heritage. Curiel was born in Indiana, although his mother is of Cuban descent whose parents emigrated from Mexico, according to U.S. Immigration Bureau documents. Trump has questioned Curiel's judgment and suggested he has an "absolute conflict" in presiding over Trump University cases because Curiel was born in Indiana. Trump has called Curiel "unfair," a "hater" and said he "has no business trying to run our court system."

"The president has the ability to disavow any of this," says Ellis of the Ku Klux Klan coverup. "These people have to be afraid that they have a president with the power to fire or remove them. If he is truly a bigot, he would find a way to undo the most important thing he is doing for the country, which is restoring its image."

Trump is unlikely to take drastic measures to prevent such racist speech. Instead, he might attempt to dismiss Trump's racist supporters as "deplorables." Or he could go after them personally.

Trump has an extensive list of targets, says Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center. "It includes, for instance, the Jewish reporters who covered him in New York, the Latino reporters that cover him in New York, anyone in media who asks him questions," she says. "He has been called a racist many times."

Trump has already called for an investigation of the media "who question [his] background" and said the press "have to be much tougher." A Trump adviser told USA Today that the president-elect would "go after individual reporters and reporters groups that give him a hard time."

Some reporters are taking the threat seriously. When Trump was asked after a rally in Florida about threats to journalists in the audience by supporters, he said they were "very peaceful." In a CNN interview, Trump declined to criticize his supporters. "I don't know anything about that," he said, when asked about threats. "I don't know if you know about that. But I tell you, we're going to be looking into it."

" — proving white personhood by showing proof of birth.

Trump's rise to political prominence was driven in part by a conspiracy theory coated in racism. "If Trump had a black adviser with him at the convention, I'm sure it would have been all over cable news. It would have been the topic of every political talk show," says Stephen Colbert, the comic who mocked Trump on his Comedy Central show, The Colbert Report.

But Trump's ascendancy has also been aided by a long-persecuted group: undocumented Hispanic immigrants and Latinos. According to the Pew Research Center, one-in-ten American adults — 13 percent in August, the latest data available — are undocumented immigrants. About 40 percent of illegal aliens live in one of the 12 states where Trump won the most votes.

"You can't have the president-elect running around in a bigoted way, saying Mexicans are rapists and calling for mass deportation of people," says Jennifer Elzea, professor of history and ethnic studies at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.

Immigrants are less likely to vote, but the effects are far more profound after election day. They often feel a new sense of belonging or have a connection to a candidate whose campaign resonated with them. "It could help Trump get votes in states that would otherwise be in play — not to mention states like Indiana. Trump wins because of his support among the white working-class voters who would normally be more Republican-leaning," Ellis adds.

A 2016 study of Latino immigrants to the U.S. found significant negative correlations — both positive and negative — between Latinos' trust in the government and their belief that immigrants should leave the country.

And then on Election Day, immigrants were more likely to vote for Democrats like Clinton and Obama.

"I think Donald Trump has made a lot of progress in legitimizing white supremacy in the United States, and that's something that was going to take some time, but it might not be a question of whether it happens, but when," says Elzea, the professor. "I don't think that Trump won on racism, but on the myth that racism doesn't exist."

It may be too early to see whether that "fact" will hold. But with Trump's "alt-right" supporters on the march, and many white Americans on edge about a future where racial and ethnic minorities are in on the take, many Americans are not taking the bait.

"Trump just seems so out of touch," says Jennifer Lee, who voted for Hillary Clinton in November's election. Lee was referring to Trump's repeated claims that the United States is a "racist country."

"Trump just seems so out of touch," says Lee, an attorney from the Chicago suburb Park Ridge.

" from a white person to prove they had been freed, and they were often required to prove it on a regular basis.

"I think we can all speak honestly about that," Cruz said in January 2016. "I think he was born in the United States. He was born on American soil. We all know that."

Even after Trump announced he wasn't, Republicans continued to question the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate for months.

"When the conspiracy theories started taking off, of course that became part of what Donald Trump was all about," says Mark LeVell, a Republican media strategist and former adviser to McCain and the 2008 campaign.

Trump never had a formal position on the theory of Obama's birthplace until he ran for president. A month ago he said he was "absolutely" looking into the issue. He gave some ground when he stopped short of saying he believes Obama was born in Kenya, but he still made clear his position: That he believed Obama lacked legitimacy to be president of the United States.

"If I am so fortunate to be elected president, my plan will be to produce my birth certificate, sign it, and release it immediately after I take office," Trump said in February. "Because I'm sure he doesn't want people to say we were born in Mexico."

After months of the birther movement, no evidence of Obama's birthplace has surfaced. Trump has claimed his own position as "100 percent correct," but he's also said he doesn't know if Obama was in fact born in the United States and has said Obama was born in the United States but was "a bad student" so that he is secretly ineligible to run for office. And as recently as early May he suggested there were some people who doubt Obama's real birthplace.

"There are people that were wondering, where did he get the idea he was a Muslim?" he said on "Fox & Friends" in May 2014, referring to Obama. "We found out he really studied it very hard. We found out he really studied it very closely when he was a community organizer. So I think he's very proud of that and very proud of the fact that he grew up and went to a great school."

Even after Trump made his birther theory mainstream, he was reluctant to make any specific policy proposals on the issue. On Fox & Friends this past spring, Fox News host Steve Doocy asked Trump whether he would "get a serious investigation" into whether Obama was really born in the country. Trump's response: "Well, I want to focus on jobs. I want to focus on the military."

Asked about this answer in Wisconsin on June 5, Trump said, "I'll answer the question on Obama's birth certificate when I make my big speech, and hopefully I will have very little problem doing that. I mean, you know, maybe somebody has better ideas. Maybe I will have a chance to get back to you on that."

Trump has since moved the birth certificate conspiracy one step further. He started claiming, without any evidence whatsoever, that Obama was not born in the United States. On June 21 he said on Twitter he would "cancel" the press conference scheduled for June 15 in Washington, D.C. if the White House held any additional press conference on the issue.

Trump's position hasn't gotten better. He took another step on June 12 by stating that he still doesn't believe Obama was born in the United States.

"I don't know where he was born, I don't know anything about it. I was given that information. I'm going to give it away," Trump told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. "It could be something that, you know, maybe

" and were treated as inferiors. It was an example, says Ellis, of "how racism and hatred for others can morph into an appeal to the 'better angels' of human nature."

So there is an enduring, but often overlooked, parallel between Trump's candidacy and the "racically coded" campaign rhetoric used by the "good ol' boys" of the Jim Crow South that white Americans were able to use in the 1800s, says Thomas Espenshade, a professor of American Studies at the University of Houston and author of "The Making of the President, 1861-1865."

Trump's "frequently racist rants and rhetoric, and his willingness to use those rants for political purposes, is not only very similar to the language that was used by white Southern whites in the 1800s, but was also a staple of the white supremacist movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries," says Espenshade, who has interviewed more than 200 people who interacted with Trump or members of his staff during the campaign.

In his book, Ellis, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, makes an implicit argument that Trump supporters have a racist worldview, one that is informed by a racist past, and could not have voted for him otherwise.

"To imagine the kind of people who voted for Trump as the same crowd of racists of Trump's supporters does not take into account that Trump's most ardent supporters are also Trump's most extreme critics," Ellis writes.

The historian points to his interview with Michael Hill, a black Trump supporter, who said that Trump's election could be good for his future because "it's a wake-up call for white people to come out of that closet and see that we are racist."

Trump himself has expressed disdain for the role racism has played in his politics.

"I've hired a lot of people of color. A lot of jobs I've had to fill from all walks of life," he told NPR in February. "And you know what, there's no racism, there's no discrimination against whites. There's tremendous and it's one of the things I consider to be the greatest assets, is the fact that I'm a very talented person and I'm a very good person. There's nobody better than me."

But, says Ellis, "the role of racism in the Trump candidacy was not incidental." Trump "tore off its mask and revealed its racist roots," he says. "The way that he has handled the issue of race has been more or less consistent with all his previous statements over the course of about a half-century."<|endoftext|>It's always important to know who you're dealing with when dealing with any and all types of law enforcement, even in a country where it's fairly universal practice. However, you may not realize just how bad it can be for you when dealing with the law. While the concept of civil asset forfeiture should be quite familiar by now, it's actually a legal procedure where law enforcement can take private property or cash through civil asset forfeiture. For the most part, civil asset forfeiture is done so after criminal charges are laid, but even under a criminal prosecution, your rights have been ignored when it comes to civil asset forfeiture.

In the United States, we have a concept known as "equitable sharing"… an arrangement under the federal law whereby US law enforcement can circumvent state laws and take seized items without ever charging you. The federal government can give state law enforcers large sums of money to do their dirty work and it does NOT require a criminal conviction. Even when a state does prosecute a criminal case against you, it is allowed under the guise of the civil asset forfeiture law to continue their work without them being held accountable for their actions.

The community at GameFAQS are especially toxic, they often say that all Daisy fans are trolls that want bait, and trash talk the character with insulting drive-by posts.

Some even accuse her of being a Peach ripoff, despite their few similarities. No one bashes Peach that much, she's Nintendo's princess.

TLDR: For a Mario character that has been a recurring playable character for over a decade, Daisy deserves better from Nintendo and it's fans. She's more than just Orange Peach, and I genuinely was disappointed when she was just a colour in Brawl in my younger years.

 that he receives thanks to Nintendo. The reason why Waluigi received a Smash Wii U update in 2014 is because he was too popular with the fans (I would say to those who say he's not good enough: just look at this. I know, not the best example, but you get my point).

If there was ever a Mario character who needed an image makeover, it would be Waluigi. His face is always a sore spot for Mario players, and even some Nintendo fans and most other Smash Bros. fans. He's an icon of Nintendo, and his face belongs in a Mario game. Waluigi also doesn't really fit Nintendo gaming's "loyalty model", for which he was created, and yet Waluigi just got better with every iteration of Mario Maker, and is now being pushed through all stages and made into a playable character.

Nintendo, please go to hell. And if you're thinking that's a joke or we're all insane…please give me some real advice, because I'm really, really hurt by all this. I want Daisy in Smash. I want her to be a worthy opponent (for the record, the best Luigi main I know plays Daisy). I want her to be used properly in tournament. But I want it bad. And I'm still in shock that the game wouldn't allow it.

I will gladly forgive Nintendo if they ever decide to let Daisy be a playable character in Smash, because I will gladly forgive them for the last 8 years of my life.

Instead, that offseason became an albatross for the club, as the departure of striker Thierry Henry left a hole in the Red Bulls' lineup. Henry, at age 32, had won the league championship with the team in 2013, while leading the league in goals the previous two years. Instead, as Wright-Phillips' debut campaign was about to unfold, the club suffered a 2-0 loss at Red Bull Arena to the Houston Dynamo in Henry's return to the field.

Wright-Phillips continued to score goals in a big way, adding eight goals in just 17 matches, but not only were the Red Bulls struggling, they were in last place in the Eastern Conference, just eight points out of a playoff spot. What many fans, pundits, and pundits on both sides of the Hudson River saw as a missed opportunity to bolster the team proved to be a big letdown.

In his first season back in MLS, Wright-Phillips played an integral role in the Red Bulls turnaround, scoring six goals in just 11 appearances across all competitions, a sign of what could have been had the club had one more year and invested in a productive

 of Waluigi. His animations are almost identical, and he even has a similar voice actor. He even uses the same music from "The Legend of Zelda". You name Waluigi, and there's a pretty high chance that there's a chance that he's the default character for any Mario game, and that could be the reason why Waluigi fans are more abusive than Daisy fans

But that doesn't make Mario Maker a bad game. The level designs look incredible, they look amazing, and they have great music. The only reason they didn't include Daisy is because there's no Smash Bros. for Wii U on Wii U, and that's an insult to her, because she looks so good in Waluigi and all his appearances. Just take a look below at Waluigi's design comparison. They may be at the same design scale, but Daisy definitely isn't. If you do the same math, you'll notice that he's slightly wider and has more details, which would explain why Waluigi didn't even consider her for Mario Maker.

Even Waluigi's official Smash Brothers game, "Shantae and the Pirate's Curse", is not Daisy-themed. This is a very odd thing to see, because Daisy is based off an actual real-life character named Daisy Fortunella Collins, aka "Duke of Daisy".

Now that I mentioned Duke Fortunella, let's dig in deeper.

Here's her profile on Wikipedia.

Wikipedia is a great source. Go read it. It doesn't go into any specifics about her personal life and history apart from her first appearance. It just states that she was born in 1869 and that she was a musician and poet. It also tells us that she has "unusual taste" for music, which is why she's such a good painter or dancer.

Now let's go to her music page on the official Super Mario Collection website. This is how it states.

Duke of Daisy was an early champion of the musical, dancing, and acrobatic form of American Pop and Jazz (the modern "Jazz") before its popularity declined amid its association with the burgeoning black social and cultural movement. (Wikipedia, Duke of Daisy)

You can see the "unusual taste" here. A guy who loves music, dancing, and acrobatics. Is that too much of a stretch, but you get the idea. The article doesn't explain anything else about her, nor does it explain anything about her husband, Mario as a musician and dancer, so no one really knows what that all means.

But Waluigi does share a lot of traits with Daisy, and there's a lot to explain.

Wario's family are very old. Waluigi's father is said to be around 100 years old by Mario Paint. It's said that Waluigi's aunt is much the same age because she is supposedly older than Waluigi. Waluigi is the youngest of Mario's children yet has been around forever. Waluigi is the very last of Mario's children to be born, in fact, Mario was married before Waluigi was even born – he also had at least one child by Daisy before she was conceived. Waluigi never left his mother's side. Daisy went missing after her father went into hiding and the rest of her family went into hiding as well along with her as well.

I don't think any of those is too much of a stretch. When playing Mario's games, I rarely have to think too hard about any of that. Mario himself says there is no rule saying that he has to have more children. It was probably just an accident that made him think about having

It's not worth addressing Waluigi in this thread, but it would be a lie to say that the Mario Maker community has completely turned its back on Daisy. There can be many, many reasons why a developer would make a character that's not Mario, or why a character is chosen by Smash Brothers. The bottom line is that people play Mario for many reasons, not for what they wish to be.

The actor, who plays Sherlock's arch nemesis Dr. John Watson, revealed that the cast and crew of the show were a huge help with the script for the new season and that they were a joy to work with.

We also spoke to castmates Martin Freeman and Amanda Abbington on what it was like to film scenes and to work with Cumberbatch on the set of Sherlock as well as how they keep themselves fit for the filming of the show. Below is an exclusive excerpt from our interview with them that reveals the secrets behind their roles.

The new season of Sherlock will see Moriarty (aka Andrew Scott) back for the very close of the run. Why did you want to come back?

SUE LAWLER (Cumberbatch): So we go into [the second half of the second series] and we find out something that we thought we had figured out, and it goes a little bit more in a direction that's very different, and you're all as shocked as we are.

BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH (Freeman): We're all very excited, but at the same time it was a very hard choice for us, because obviously our plan was not to bring Moriarty back. We were all waiting to find out what it was and I think that's where this whole thing, when we got into season two, was a lot of discussion, of why we would bring him back. One of the reasons is because Martin Freeman is really good in every single scene and every single scene in the second half of season two is as good as Moriarty ever was. One of the reasons was obviously the scripts that the director wrote and the great writers. But also, the set and the cast. We're all in really great form. Everything from the actors to the production people to the wardrobe to what was going on at that time. We've all had an amazing season at West End.

MARTIN FREEMAN (Freeman): We all loved it and what has happened to us is a real surprise, but everyone's great. The writers are amazing, the director's fantastic, the actors, the crew, everyone is brilliant.

SUE LAWLER: The people who do the makeup, the set designer, the set dressers, the people of course that helped to bring things to life – we were so lucky with these people – and all the actors are incredible. We've had incredible performances.

BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH: It's really funny because the first thing I did when I got the script [for the new season], my first scene that I shot was actually in the second-to-last episode of last season, and it was the last scene that Andrew Scott had on screen. And as I was watching it it became very clear to me that something was happening, and I just

Some even accuse her of being a Peach ripoff, despite their few similarities. No one bashes Peach that much, she's Nintendo's princess.

TLDR: For a Mario character that has been a recurring playable character for over a decade, Daisy deserves better from Nintendo and it's fans. She's more than just Orange Peach, and I genuinely was disappointed when she was just a colour in Brawl in my younger years.

Before you bring up Waluigi

It's obvious that Nintendo and the fans put him at a higher pedestal. They acknowledged that they planned to put Waluigi in MK7. They didn't even consider Daisy for Mario Maker! And he has become an extremely popular character thanks to the exposure

And there are several references to Waluigi throughout the MK series. Most notably Waluigi Bros and Waluigi Smash Balls.

Wario also has similarities to Daisy and Waluigi. Like Daisy, Waluigi is also from the Mushroom Kingdom and can transform into a giant walrus.

The Waluigi amiibo is also basically the same. A Waluigi amiibo in the Super Smash Bros. series is actually a Waluigi amiibo in Mario Maker for Wii U, and Daisy appears in a Waluigi amiibo.

They both are giant, stupid and always chase Mario. The Waluigi amiibo is even named after Waluigi.

And the character itself is based on Waluigi's appearance in Mario Paint - a 2D Platformer game, which is a Mario game.

A Waluigi amiibo is also the name of a Waluigi costume for Brawl, and a Waluigi amiibo is the only Mario character in the game which has a Waluigi amiibo costume. And the character is also based on Waluigi's appearance in Mario Paint, which is a 2D Platformer game, which is a Mario game.

The Waluigi amiibo has his own version of Mario power ups too:

When holding a Waluigi amiibo, Mario can pick up and throw items or coins.

When holding a Waluigi amiibo, Bowser Jr takes damage.

If a Waluigi amiibo is obtained, when he picks up an item or coin, Yoshi will be thrown.

Waluigi in Mario Maker even has Waluigi Smash Balls for you to use if you want to make Waluigi. It looks like a traditional Mario level. The only problem is that Waluigi Smash Balls disappear very, very quickly. They're actually based on Waluigi's appearance in Mario Paint, which is a 2D Platformer game, which is a Mario game.Waluigi in Mario Maker even has Waluigi Smash Balls for you to use if you want to make Waluigi.

After that, it took me a while to recover from my visit … and there was another visit from the doctors two weeks ago. I really can't give you a good reason for the delays, although it is possible that it had something to do with my being in such a hurry to get this done so I wouldn't forget about it …

Now the dentist is going away for another six weeks, and I will get to make sure that I do this before she leaves (well, I am really looking forward to that!)

Anyway, I have been doing some research on how long a tooth must sit before it is fully grown to allow the growth of the rest of the teeth.

My conclusion is that a child should begin taking out their first teeth at an average age of 6 years old (I am using the average age of the parents of my twin daughters at 5). After that, it would be about an average 6 to 8 years for the others (with a couple of exceptions, in their case, I will let them know!)

I decided to look at data from Canada, New Zealand and Australia. They all have very different ages (usually a little more than in the U.S.). They show that the age at which teeth grow in New Zealand is more like 1 year old in the U.S. (from an estimated age of 8-11) and 2

Republicans have their next big election of the 2016 cycle, the Iowa Republican presidential caucus, coming up. And for at least a short while, I think the party will be torn between a conservative candidate and conservative positions on everything from the economy to abortion, on which they've tried to have it both ways.

The first candidate in the field, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R), has an anti-abortion record as its front-runner. He's also led efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, which does offer breast exams if patients aren't willing to pay for them themselves, but the anti-choice activists, and their allies in the media, are not taking him lightly.

The second Republican in the race is Donald Trump, and he's had it with those same conservatives and what they have done to the Republican Party. He has spent much energy this year attacking Cruz personally and in a way people on Twitter, such as National Review's Jonah Goldberg, have likened to a modern version of the Soviet Union. He's also gone out of his way to make clear that conservative principles, which he's long promoted, would not take precedence over the Republican primary.

On Fox Business Network on Wednesday, Trump spoke directly to voters in Iowa:

"I have a great relationship with the evangelicals. I've got huge majorities with evangelicals in Florida. I've got huge majorities with evangelicals in South Carolina. I love them. And I'm going to make them proud."

Trump had been talking about an ad he'd seen that attacked Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on abortion and abortion policy during the Iowa Caucus.

"We have never had a candidate for president that believes that being pro-life is a liability and should be eliminated from every discussion, from every debate, and this is an example of the kind of thinking that our country needs in our leadership – we need the leadership of Donald Trump!" he told Chris Wallace.

It sounds a lot like some of what he said to Fox News' Sean Hannity.

"We're going to take care of everybody because our country, our government, can't take care of everybody, but most importantly we have to take care of our leader," Trump said on Hannity's show. And, just as he did with Cruz, he's made the fight for defunding Planned Parenthood one of his big issues. Trump and Cruz have a very good friendship going back to the primaries and the primary debates. Their respective camps, the Trump camp and the Cruz camp in particular, have had a lot of back-alley communication, and that has continued into the caucuses.

So what does Trump mean when he says, "No-brainer!"? His answer is very specific, and it would appear that he would be in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood even if Republicans won the election.

In 2008, as Cruz was preparing to run for Senate, I asked then-Sen. McCain (R-Ariz.), his biggest critic on abortion in the Bush years, about defunding Planned Parenthood in the presidential election. McCain said that was a debate he wasn't interested in having.

"No, not really," McCain told me in 2007. "Look, I am pro-life. But Planned Parenthood gives family planning help to 1.5 million women in America every

 was the Guggenheim Bilbao (2008–2011, architect Mies van der Rohe, architects Guggenheim Bilbao SA and the New York Foundation for the Arts). It was made in the Guggenheim Museum's own style (the "Renaissance Gigue"), with an organic structure, which was inspired by the works of the Swiss landscape architect Albrecht Dürer and the architect Hans Haacke (among others). The building's complex is shaped like a barrel, with two cylinders, each measuring three stories long. The main cylinder has a base, with interior spaces containing large transparent windows and arched doors; a triangular window at the top projects from the uppermost cylinder, opening to a large rectangular area. The cylindrical cylinder and its interior structures form an uninterrupted whole. The building is decorated with the same kind of arched doorways that characterize many of the buildings in its style. A monumental staircase from the first (lower) cylinder to the second (upper) cylinder leads to a roof deck. The building's two cylindrical cylinders are not connected by stairs, as the ground floor is also reached by a staircase from the lower cylinder (as it is on the ground floor and uppermost cylinders of the Mies van der Rohe Bilbao). Since the roof deck is at the top of the building and has the same height as the cylindrical cylinder, its exterior wall resembles a cylindrical barrel and a ceiling-level window. This architectural form has its own formal qualities, as it is able to express the tension between the interior architecture and the exterior, a tension that becomes apparent in the architecture itself. The building is intended to show the interplay of light, volume, and materials in a manner that is visually pleasing. In contrast to "normal" architecture, the Guggenheim Bilbao appears as a cylinder, a kind of cylinder or a spherical shell, and as a cylinder is a cylinder in an organic structure.<|endoftext|>The video would have started up the next day, if not for the fact that I'd been in a bar for the past several hours. "I need to get a life," I said, in the most deadpan manner. I was a little drunker than I'd been in months, and this was coming out of the blue for me. "You'd be surprised," said the bartender, "that the most difficult thing I feel about getting a life is that there just isn't enough of one for me."

I was just getting over a divorce. I had recently gotten a new job and had been living in an apartment for the last year. As a result of the divorce, I had a lot of moving to do, and I'd come from a place, a relationship, and a life where I'd been able to get a lot. I felt like I could take on the world—which was strange, considering that I had not been in the world for some time. I felt like I could take on the world, but at the same time, I felt like I should not. And so I didn't.

I had a lot of moving to do.

It took some time for me to feel like I was moving forward again in the years since my divorce. In some ways, it seemed like I was stuck in the past. All of those things I felt weren't even relevant to me if I was living in the past—but they were important because they were part of the past, and to some extent they were an explanation for why things were different than what they had been, rather than what they really were. Now that I was still working and was making a lot of money, things seemed to be finally improving. Some day, as a result

The report confirms what we've known for over a year—that members of the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, knowingly participated in an effort to influence the outcome of the US election, and helped facilitate a disinformation campaign in an attempt to help the then candidate.

The release of the report was widely heralded as a milestone in the Trump administration's efforts against Russia. The report also came one day before a January hearing before a Senate Committee set to investigate alleged Russian operations around the US election. In his opening statement, the president-elect himself called the release of the report "a tremendous victory for our country" as he celebrated his win over Hillary Clinton.

We should note that this document has a very different tone than Trump's. It is filled with accusations, conspiracy theories, and innuendo—far different than the way Trump characterized the hacks.

The White House did manage one significant difference: the release of this report contained a list of individuals who worked on it. They were not named, but they included a former senior intelligence official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and a former senior adviser to the CIA director, among others.

But the biggest piece of news this past week, and the one that most directly challenges the idea that Russia interfered in the 2016 election as US intelligence alleges, was that former President Obama—who, despite Trump's insistence, did not do anything about it during his time in office—has taken the unprecedented step of declassifying the entire document.

This is an extraordinary move for the office of the president. It is a public acknowledgment that the American people have a right to know what exactly Russia tried to do during the election, and its goal of undermining the US democratic process.

The documents released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) provide no new evidence—only new allegations—that Russian actors tried to influence the US election in any way. The document does not provide any evidence on Russian involvement in the hacking of Democratic political institutions, or its publication in WikiLeaks. The document does not even indicate a Russian role in the Russian campaign surrounding the leaking of private email and document information belonging to the Democratic National Convention this past July.

This release is a significant milestone, and one that sets a precedent that will likely set the legal and policy grounds for future disclosures of information about foreign interference in US elections.

It also demonstrates what is likely to be an even more serious concern of Russian interference in the future: the very high thresholds of trust foreign intelligence agencies must meet before making claims to US audiences that may not be true. The fact that the CIA and ODNI are not providing any evidence to back up their claims leaves the possibility open that they will continue to make these claims, if necessary, to make themselves look good to their allies, and possibly to help push a narrative of US-Russian cooperation.

 was the Stadshaft in Hamburg, Germany (1964–68, architect Otto Friedrich, architects of Frank Gehry and others). This is a unique architectural building that exemplifies the new modernist style.

For architecture and landscape, the second half of the twentieth century was characterized by a return to traditional forms. However, this time, rather than being inspired by abstract works of art and architecture, the architecture of the 1960's and 1970's was inspired by landscape and nature. The buildings of this period are often designed for the countryside, the forests, the sea beaches, the gardens, and the wilderness of the landscape. However, in the 1980's-90's, new styles of architectural and landscape buildings have been added to this tradition. The buildings of the new wave are often based on organic processes-the processes of plants and animals-and are considered almost natural. One of the first of these new types are the concrete house, often based on recycled materials (for example, the Kombinarem House in Copenhagen, built using an old shipping container).

New styles of organic architecture are closely related to the natural forms of landscape, trees, plants, shrubs, and rocks, especially when they resemble the local culture and traditions. A new trend is to form buildings from natural materials, which is called the organic design. This style resembles organic processes and consists of natural and naturalized materials. It is often combined with organic forms in order to create a holistic appearance.

The term landscape architecture or landscape building in particular comes to us from the works of Ernst Stuhlinger (1912-2004), whose works were strongly influenced by European classical culture. He was interested in building the most natural environments possible. A characteristic of landscape architecture is its ability to express a sense of calm, freedom, and timelessness. It is based on a profound knowledge of the landscape and the plants and flowers that grow in it. Stuhlinger's works are characterized by the fact that their form reflects the composition of the land, its orientation and the season of the year. By placing plants, animals and elements of flora and fauna in harmonious relationships, he creates an environment with an atmosphere of tranquility-often referred to as "happiness". He believed that, when it came to architectural design, the landscape would take care of itself. He often considered the environment as being a partner of the architect in his work.<|endoftext|>It's an exciting time for gamers. The next generation of consoles are on the way, with Sony and Microsoft having unveiled their plans recently. Then there are the long-rumoured next-gen consoles (Gran Turismo, Gears of War, Fable Legends and so on), where gamers' interest should be high. As gamers wait for the new consoles, Microsoft and Sony have made a commitment to provide the best possible gaming experiences on the next-gen.

In an interview with GamesSpot, Microsoft's Phil Spencer gave gamers a hint at the next consoles:

"The next generation of consoles is all about the games. We've got a commitment to continue to push the boundaries of game design. I think that's where we find our greatest success, and again I want to get this out there early—we have lots of exciting things on the horizon for Xbox."

Microsoft has already announced their plan: next gen will be bigger not only in terms of the hardware, but also in terms of the content; gamers will be able to play many of their favourite games for free (for example: you can play a free weekend of Halo on Xbox One), but there are big games in development with the intention to release on the next-gen.

"His transition with his new D has been somewhat seamless."

McLennan, who keeps a close eye on goalies around the league in his work for TSN, says Miller has been better in his movement this season.

Miller might not have been ready for this challenge, but he has learned a valuable lesson: no matter what happens, you have to enjoy the process. It was time to take that approach that he got from St. Louis, and he hasn't had any regrets about it.

"There's not much better than getting the opportunity to be in St. Louis and having the opportunity to play against the opposition and having to compete against them," Miller said. "There's no better feeling than that, and I'm definitely really excited, it's been fun.

"It's been different in St. Louis, but there's a little more pressure with the Leafs, but you just know that you're the guy in a situation like this and you have to stick with it, and hopefully do what I've done: be on your A-Game and stick with it. I can handle it if I need to. So hopefully I can handle a little bit more and be that guy for the Leafs."

The London Games have seen a number of sporting stars come out in support of same-sex marriage, after several Olympic champions came out in favour of the causes in the lead up to the Games, such as Sir Chris Hoy, who announced he supported the proposals.

In the US, the same-sex marriage debate has been a major political issue, with Republican Senate candidate and former Senate majority leader Todd Akin's 'legitimate rape' comment leading many of his Republican opponents to call for his withdrawal from the race.

Australia, meanwhile, is preparing to host next year's Rugby Sevens World Series, which would see a world record be set for the best Sevens game played on the men's side, as Australia looks to take on a global sporting leader like the US or Canada.

New Zealand's Sam Bremner is another New Zealand sportsman who is supporting same-sex marriage, and he said today that it would be a great idea for the country to allow people to register their relationships so they can have "the freedom to show their love."

"It does mean it's a lot easier to stay together as a couple in New Zealand for life. So I think it would be great," Bremner, a former rugby player turned television presenter said today via Facebook . "It would help with relationships later in life. It might actually be a thing as people get older."

"I feel like I'm starting a new chapter in my career in Denver," Miller said of his decision to re-sign with the Avalanche. "I'm really excited about the opportunity the Avalanche had given me to play a full season in the NHL. I know I've worked hard the last couple of years, and I feel like I've had my best year in the NHL.

"I'm thankful to the Avalanche for having the same vision as mine regarding my development. I plan on taking it a step further with this next season and continuing to play at an exceptionally high level as I build on this year."

He hopes that will happen.

"I want to get back to where I was in St. Louis," he said. "That's where I felt I was having the best season, and with another great year to build on with Colorado, things will just get better for me overall."

He's already a player the Avalanche think of as a future captain.

"Our goal, going into this season, was to make this team better," head coach Patrick Roy said. "I think we did that. It's not the best that we've played, but right now we have seven more games to go, and so we have to go and be a better team. And I believe it's going to be a great story for this team to have a guy in the NHL that's in a similar situation as Semyon Varlamov, and be able to talk about that in the future."

Now, Miller will work to do one thing more:

"I'm going to try to win," Miller said. "I don't think about it too much – I've had enough of that over the last couple of months. But I'm going to go there with a win attitude and try to make the team better, and bring a Stanley Cup to Denver."<|endoftext|>The first step: the design for the body

If the design is going to be changed, the first step is to determine the overall shape and dimensions for the body. It must have straight lines, and must be as accurate as possible in accordance with what is necessary for the finished product.

After determining the shape and dimensions, the shape and dimensions are turned into a drawing via a computer program. After the computer drew them, they were colored with a transparent paint (to reveal the color of the paint in order to trace the shape).

The pattern that is painted on the sketch is called a CAD (computer-aided design) pattern. CAD pattern is used to create the actual parts. For example, a rectangular hole is traced on the CAD pattern via 3D printing, which then is molded into the exact shape of the hole.

After the CAD pattern is finished, the design is sent to a design studio, which is involved in the actual drawing and manufacturing process of the parts.

The CAD pattern is then sent by e-mail to 3D printers. There are many types of 3D printers. For instance, many printers in the home use FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technology which is capable of making a single layer of parts with a layer thickness of 0.2 mm.

For our project, we chose a high-end desktop FDM printer called the Makerbot Replicator 2X. It has a very large build area of 3,843 square centimeters in 3D printing.

The printer produces a single layer of parts with a layer thickness of 0.

They show a group of people and a truck traveling on I-25.

This is from just after the shooting in San Bruno. The truck was spotted as a white vehicle with tinted windows, and it is definitely not someone's home. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the person in that truck is a suspect. The paper also reports that the gunman, Eric Harris, is dead. It's quite possible that Harris and Klebold didn't have time to reload their guns, and that they simply had to shoot to kill after a brief discussion.

Another shot of the truck from earlier. It's hard to get a feel for the size and shape of the vehicle — we're pretty sure it's a van, but we have no way of knowing for sure.

Other photos show more suspects along I-25. At least one person is in a car and at least one is on foot. One photo shows an empty home, although more shots of a house or apartment building could show that it was not inhabited at the time. It's hard to see from this angle what kind of clothes these people wore.

The genetic engineering was done in order to render mosquitoes infestful parasites. But instead of killing their prey, the modified mosquitoes become infected when passing through human mouths, so mosquitoes can't breed with their offspring. That's where the mosquito nets came in. This allows mosquitoes to pass their offspring to wild species without having to find another means to propagate.

The mosquitoes are produced by a company in Florida called Oxitec, which has raised about 5 million sterile females over the last few years in the Florida Keys. It began offering the mosquito nets, known as ABC mosquito nets, to public schools in the first quarter of this year, and as of Monday were being offered to some of the city's public elementary schools. Oxitec and local and city officials say there have been no reports of any local residents contracting dengue fever or chikungunya by eating the mosquito nets, at least until now.

Dengue fever is an illness that attacks the central nervous system. Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne virus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and is usually a mild infection. But in tropical areas, the virus can lead to fevers, high fever, rash, joint pain

 But with his experience, he was able to focus and get ready for the next game."

Still, could anyone really have anticipated a 10-1-0 start?

"He has adapted to his new surroundings a lot quicker than I expected," former NHL goalie Jamie McLennan said. "There's always trial and error, where you're getting to know the tendencies of your new defensemen in front of you, how they play, how they like the puck set up behind the net, or how it's going to work with exchanges.

"His transition with his new D has been somewhat seamless."

McLennan, who keeps a close eye on goalies around the league in his work for TSN, says Miller has been better in his movement this season.

"He's a positional goaltender that plays at the top of this crease, and when he's on his game, he reads the developing plays well and anticipates," McLennan said. "He's been much more efficient in his movement, crease management this season, very efficient with his rebound control, and has delivered big saves when needed; something that wasn't always there in St. Louis. His comfort level in the net is very high in

 that regard."

What he needs to do next

McLennan added: "He needs to finish better. He's a quality penalty killer. He played well on that in the American League. He could improve his faceoff percentages and do away with the 'woe is me' mindset when he loses the puck. He needs to get the puck out of defensive zone to start his attack; the defensive zone goes off the skates, it becomes a free play. But he needs to do better when he does enter the offensive zone."

As for his personal development, Miller, 24, says he's been impressed by the strides he has made in his craft – as a goaltender, too.

"As long as I'm skating, I'm going to feel comfortable on the ice," Miller said. "That's always been a goal of mine. … I'm definitely still a work in progress as far as my skating ability. I've got ways to go, but right now I have confidence in where I am."

GRAHAM HENRY has been named in the squad named to train in Dubai.

The former Reading FC footballer will train with the UAE under-23 side this week and is part of the 18-player squad for the friendly matches later this week against Pakistan.

Henry can look forward to training with his new club at the Al Ain training complex in Al Ain on Monday before heading back to The Madejski to prepare for their final game of the season.

He will return to Leeds United Football Club and start pre-season training with the first team squad as well as the U23 squad.

"It's good to be included in such a good squad in the UAE," said Henry, who played under head coach Neil Redfearn while with the Royals.

"I'm looking forward to working with the coaching set-up and will be looking to bring my experience from last season to the club where I want to succeed."

The UAE will face Pakistan in friendly matches on Tuesday (August 6) and Friday (August 12).

The UAE U23s will compete against the Pakistan Zaka-e-Lahore at the Dubai International Stadium on August 14 and 16.

The woman, who has asked not to be named, was shopping in Devonport on Thursday when she put the bag in the bin.

She then noticed two stamps on the outside of the bag with the words 'Titanic' and 'Sinking' and opened it to find a letter from her son William.

She said: "I was out shopping at the Dorset shore when I saw the plastic container with the marks on it. I assumed it was empty so I just emptied the bag out. The moment it came out I read the words 'Titanic' and 'Sinking' and thought it must be old or something and put it in the bin.

Islamic terrorism is Islamic

Professor Siddiqui said there was no denying that ISIS was an Islamic organisation, as their vocabulary was rooted in Islamic terminology.

"Although it's very easy to say any violent jihadist or any ISIS member or anyone who joins ISIS is not a Muslim anymore, simple and simplistic denials of things don't actually move the conversation," she said.

"The problem now is that we're looking at everything from the prism of terror ... so even things that are not linked to violence give off the impression that ultimately they will lead to violence.

"It's become very easy for a lot of Western societies to perceive the Muslim presence as a real threat."

The problem with the veil debate

Professor Siddiqui said her concern about with the veil was that it reduced Islam to a dress code.

"The veil has become this iconic image of everything that the West has struggled against," she said.

"It struggled against segregation, it struggled against inequality. It has tried to create a space of at least some equality where women have autonomy.

"The veil, which was once seen as all the exoticism of the East, is now everything the West detests.

First posted<|endoftext|>I was driving home from the grocery store and found myself in a state of amazement when I saw this thing. Well, I was in a mind-body state because I hadn't even done anything that would have brought out that aspect of my personality. It was a very strange experience and I can't really find words to describe it. It was an awakening of my inner child. It made me wonder, what were these things, and just why they were placed in my way.I don't remember what I was doing when I saw it, but what I do remember is how intense the reaction was when I asked myself what was happening and what their purpose was. I asked myself why does it have to be there when, if we want to make more of our life and not live so much for the next day, why not look within and find the purpose of our existence? There was no doubt that the light was calling out to me, but I was so fearful that I didn't hear anything, or I didn't understand and I didn't even want to listen. I was just waiting. Then, after about 30 seconds, the vision was pretty much complete. Everything began to look like this. I remember being in the darkness, but it was not black and I did not have a bad trip, so I'm not sure why that is. I think that I was confused and didn't know what was what. I was very happy and excited to find everything had been explained to me. I can recall feeling all of the emotions and knowing everything perfectly. It was like my whole being was suddenly light all at once and I was free. It was all very exciting, like an awakening of my inner child. I had so many questions but I never wanted to ask so it is not easy to put into words. I was happy that it all made sense and wasn't crazy or a mess. It was very calm and simple. The next day I went about my normal life and didn't think anything about it. I think I was confused. It made me wonder what it could possibly mean, but I still kept it to myself. Then just recently I just discovered that I have an ex-wife who knows where it all came from and has been reading me a lot of books about this topic recently. I couldn't let the experience go so I decided to try to find out on my own. It was very difficult to believe at first, but I believe that it could be connected with something that I've experienced, or something that I might see in the future because it is happening very quickly now and will keep happening all the time. I would guess that it is time to start living this life with joy and love, and not fear. It is the natural state of being. It's all about the little things that are in our life and the little ways that we can be better ourselves every day. It is the simple things that are so hard to understand that make all the difference. It is the little moments that we miss out on that make the biggest difference in how we look at the world around us. All those little details and the love that we give

She said many young people in Australia are going abroad to try and escape a home where they believe the strict gender segregation is an attempt to impose some sort of gender hierarchy, with women oppressed and the men able to wear a full beard.

"And the problem is, in many ways this is a much more insidious Islamism that's actually going to require far more complicated responses," Professor Siddiqui said.

Well, that's when you turn to The Old Republic Forums and you say, "Well, I don't play a Jedi, but I would like to see it." And you make the jump to the Old Republic Universe, which is the official fan forum that all content about SWTOR is available to read. And of course, that means that if you're a regular here, you're able to see it.

The new villain is the villain Darth Malgus (or Malgus the Dark Lord), who was introduced in the Season 1 finale on March 30. And since then, that character has had numerous encounters at various points throughout the various SWTOR chapters. Here on the forums is a collection of the encounters.

This is Darth Malgus, who is voiced by Frank Darabont.

Darth Malgus

Darth Malgus (a.k.a. Malgus the Dark Lord) is the "oldest surviving Sith Lord" (and the current leader of the Sith Order). He is the most powerful of those the original trilogy has seen (the only remaining Sith Lords are Darth Bane and Darth Nihilus). He's the leader of the Sith Order of former Jedi Darth Sion (as Darth Sion the Dark Lord) and former Jedi Revan (then Darth Revan the Dark Lord). Malgus also heads the Sith Empire and the Sith Triumvirate of Darth Nihilus, Darth Traya, and Darth Marr. He holds the position of Supreme Dark Lord of the Sith. In the early years of the original trilogy, he was the Sith apprentice of Darth Nihilus. He was an ancient and powerful Dark Lord who, through the years, has managed to destroy more than two million Sith across countless star systems—including the Jedi Order itself. Over the years, he has come to learn about and use the power of the dark side. He has been called the "Old and New Sith Lords," as he knows his way of the force more than any.

The one of the encounters that is especially interesting is the encounter Darth Malgus is the Dark Lord encounters with the Jedi Council. This is the one encounter he doesn't win. I'm not saying that the Jedi were unbeatable, but you may feel differently after completing the encounter.

He appears in the first two Jedi Council missions as well as in the final chapter as a boss. I have made notes of the events here.

First posted<|endoftext|>The U.S. Department of Justice opened a preliminary probe on Monday into whether the Baltimore Ravens or the city of Baltimore violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter.

The probe was announced late Monday by an anonymous law enforcement official familiar with the case, who asked not to be identified discussing a pending investigation.

At a press conference Monday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch confirmed the existence of the investigation. She said the department will take the lead in it because the investigation is being conducted internally.

In October, Justice Department officials met with Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake to express their concerns that federal intervention had been needed, including whether civil rights charges against the six officers involved in Gray's arrest, detention and death would stand up, according to an account posted on Baltimore's CBS affiliate.

When asked Monday afternoon about a potential U.S. Justice Department involvement, a department spokesman said the investigation is ongoing.

"At this point, the Department has no comment on the possible involvement of the U.S. Attorney," said the spokesman, Ian Prior.

In a statement, the Justice Department said the preliminary steps have been taken "in order to gather more information on this troubling incident and provide guidance on appropriate actions."

"At no point has the department begun an investigation and this is a pre-investigation," according to statement from John Carlin, a spokesperson for Lynch.

On his weekly radio show, host Don Imus called the probe "highly disturbing."

"I've had to tell friends to stop calling and talking to me, because I'm afraid that I'll get into trouble," he said. "This is a good investigation, though. We need a full review, and to the people of Baltimore, it was an accident that killed Freddie Gray, not a robbery. We need a full investigation. And to the state of Maryland, it was a serious error of judgment where the police thought they were doing the right thing."

Former Baltimore Police commissioner Kevin Davis, who took over the department in October after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody sparked rioting in the city, said Lynch's confirmation of the probe will be an important step toward getting the right answers for Gray's family. Davis said he would welcome U.S. assistance because the "police were doing the right thing on every level."

"We should have had the autopsy done after the fact. You should have had the blood drawn," Davis said. "(They) should have had all the things to prove it. Because if someone takes the time to find those things, it just brings the whole event full circle. And that's really what we need here — not a piecemeal investigation. This needs to be a full investigation, and they just did that. And they didn't find a thing."

Davis said he also wants a review of the policies and training of the police department, which he said could help prevent any future incidents

What is the veil?

The word "veil" refers to any covering as opposed to a full face veil, which covers everything but a woman's eyes.

The Arabic word for the veil is niqab.

A man has been left with permanent facial disfigurement after being gang raped and bashed by a gang of Asian men.

The man, who is aged in his 30s, was in a bad way when he was attacked on the streets of Bangkok, police had said.

The gang attacked the victim as he was walking home.

The video footage, which was filmed after the attack, shows a gang of 10 Asian men beating someone with a metal rod, including one who uses it to stab the victim.

During the attack the victim is dragged by his ears to a nearby hotel and raped.

He is forced to drink his own faeces and is then thrown on the ground into a tyre by his attackers.

The victim later lost both of his eyes and his left hand after the attack which left him with permanent physical disability.

He now uses one hand to hold a fork and is still forced to go to daily therapy for pain due to the attack.

The victim told a local newspaper how he had wanted to go back to Bangkok to do some gardening.

He said: 'The hardest part about my life, now that my eyesight is fixed, is that people look at me. They see a man with one eye and don't really know what it is like to go through this.'

He thanked the ambulance workers who helped him.<|endoftext|>(CBS News) The Department of Transportation on Tuesday released the first federal report on the deadly crash that claimed the lives of 13 passengers and three crew members on United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pa. Last year, a congressional probe concluded the flight crew didn't act fast enough to interrupt the hijacking by hijacker Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was killed during the battle with the passengers and crew.

Federal investigators said in Tuesday's report the cockpit chatter and crew activity did not indicate what led to the crash.

What did help the investigation wasn't what happened on board or as the investigators discovered, that the cockpit voice recorder, or CVR, and flight data recorder were damaged, the report concludes.

"The loss of both critical CVR systems was a very significant challenge," the report says.

The investigation determined the plane had encountered severe turbulence and turbulence that lasted for a cumulative of more than 60 seconds. The report also said it discovered several anomalies with the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder.

One thing did not raise suspicions, officials said, was a flight attendant's comments just hours before Flight 93 took off, and that wasn't surprising, according to the

The Calabasas middle school that was shaken this month by attacks on redheads was jolted again Monday when news spread that two 12-year-olds and a 13-year-old had been arrested in the bizarre incident.

The students were identified in a criminal complaint as Matthew A. Gage and Matthew S. Anderson, both boys from nearby Carpinteria. They were charged last week. The charges are misdemeanors, meaning they won't be on the district's permanent criminal docket. The boys were placed in a youth center and required to turn over their passports on Monday. The suspects turned themselves in after Taylor called police.

Samara said she was touched by Taylor's reaction to the events.

"She said something about 'we're not letting this happen again, we're sending a message.' I felt that was an important message — 'hey, things like this don't make me feel like we're safe here, they make me feel like I need to keep taking extra steps.' It's not the same school," she said. "I feel like it was important to show that this isn't okay."

More Southern California Stories:<|endoftext|>When was the last time you looked at a television set and thought to yourself, "Hey, this is the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life..."? When was the last time someone told you how great it was to be watching TV on your computer, and how you should really start watching more television? I thought so.
On my regular computer screen I often find television commercials interrupting my work. I sometimes think what a great marketing move it would be if we lived in a world where commercials never appeared on television because we didn't like them, and instead we could just read them on the computer screen at work. If that sounds like an idea you might consider, then maybe you would be interested in our new project: watching a TV commercial over and over until we get the most amusing or exciting effect. But before I can get to that, we're going to need to get the most annoying commercial off the screen!
I will be using Adblock Plus for this project, because it is a great and easy to use ad blocking software. But if you don't have it, just disable Adblock Plus, and continue reading.
After installing Adblock Plus, you need to open up your Google Chrome browser, and go to this link . Go ahead and open the Chrome Extensions page. (Make sure you have the "Developer Mode" selected.) Click on the little gear icon at the top, and then click on the "More tools" menu. (It is under the blue text. Click on the "Load unpacked extension" icon.) Then click the small wrench next to "Load unpacked extension."
You should now have the ad blocking extension installed on your computer. After doing this you are now ready to start getting adverts off our television screens.
First we need to make sure our television is turned off. I don't know about you, but every time I turn the TV off it just makes the annoyance of commercials that much more annoying. To turn the television off, go into your living room, put the power cord in an outlet, and then turn the television off by pressing the button it is connected to. You need to press the "OFF" button and "SCEA" button for this to work. It is important to keep the power cord out of the way in order to be able to easily turn the television off. After the television has been turned off we can now start getting an ad off the screen.
Step 1: Right click on the television in the control panel and click on settings. At the top right of the screen click on advanced.
You should then see an option called "Ad blocking." Click on

==================== COMPLETION 30 ====================
 said she was so upset with the behavior that she called the San Gabriel Valley Union High School District's emergency operations plan and sent students home around 5 p.m. Monday.

At the end of the school day, some 400 students and teachers staged a silent prayer outside of the principal's office, the only public place where people could gather for the prayer.

"We wanted to make the point that this kind of attack is wrong, wrong, wrong," Taylor said.

The principal said she'd received dozens of emails of support.

The principal said it's not just a problem at Samara's school, but that she hopes it won't be the last incident at her school.

"Everyone needs to come together and stand strong and show what tolerance is," she said.

The principal said administrators were working with teachers to plan anti-bullying lesson plans.

In a statement, San Gabriel Unified school officials said all school staffers would begin using the code names "Bubba" and "Gus" beginning in classes Tuesday.

Samara said she understands why some redheads are afraid.

"I don't blame them for fearing me," she said, adding that she also worries what she believes to be a lack of respect for people with red hair.

"I understand why people are afraid of it," she said. "I know there are a lot of people who hate red hair."

She said that most of her peers who didn't participate in the attack were "happy" and didn't mind the jokes, but that a few did find it hurtful because they'd grown close to Samara, whose red hair is a source of family pride.

A redhead has been killed in a drive-by shooting, Samara said, and she said in the wake of the attack she doesn't think of any of her own friends as safe. She said she's not sure if more attacks are possible.

"Maybe it's just the time of year where it's more visible," she said, and she feels she's just a small minority.

The attack was apparently a "joke" but "the kids got carried away," Taylor said Tuesday.

"My guess is it was a prank gone wrong," she said.

Redheads aren't the only group that worries, Redhead Network Executive Director Susan DeAngeli said. She pointed to the case of a student at Rancho Cucamonga High School in 2006 who was suspended for wearing a Confederate flag bandana and told by his instructor that the symbol was "racist."

"That student just needed a little prodding on the subject of a history lesson," she said.

Redding High School has two redheads on its basketball team and about 150 in the student body, spokesman Brian McConathy said.

There are few incidents on Calabasas High School's campus, most of them occurring in nearby communities, he said. He said Samara said her parents were supportive and gave permission to make public announcements saying that the school would protect her.

"We want everyone to know what we can do together," she said.

 an ordinarily peaceful campus that sponsored a tolerance assembly for students Monday in the wake of the attacks. The "South Park" episode, first shown in 2005, was itself supposed to be a lesson in tolerance but misfired, with harassment of red-haired students taking place at schools across the U.S. and Canada over the last few years.

The Calabasas middle school that was shaken this month by attacks on redheads was jolted again Monday when news spread that two 12-year-olds and a 13-year-old had been arrested in the bizarre incident.

Samara Kleinfinger, 12, said she and other red-haired students were summoned to the principal's office on Nov. 20. There already had been at least one attack and administrators, alerted by students to the possibility of more, wanted to warn Samara and others to be careful.

Samara said she was punched and kicked by six students on her way to the office.

"They seemed to think it was a big, funny joke," she said. The rest of the day, a knot of friends protected her as she made her way from class to class.

On the first school day after Thanksgiving break, principal Kimmarie Taylor
==================== COMPLETION 31 ====================
 sent home a letter to parents that said: "There has been a recent report of racial harassment of a minor on our campus."

But Samara said this is ridiculous, because this has been a problem on the calabasas middle school since the first day of school, and many students have been the victims of physical and verbal harassment of their red hair. The only students singled out for ridicule, she said, are the students with the lighter-haired parents "To pretend otherwise is absurd."

It's the latest chapter in an increasingly bizarre series of incidents that have involved students at schools in a variety of states. In November, a Middlebury, Vt., student, Toni Paul, was taunted with "red haired" as she walked home from school. In October, several students at the University of Southern California were taunted with "red haired" — a slur that in some circles is considered an anti-Semitic epithet.

In the Calabasas school, parents and students had been discussing the issue at a school meeting in October and talked about their own experiences. One redhead, a third-year high school history student, said she's been teased since kindergarten and can't understand why people keep making light of the incident.

"It's just a joke," she said.

But another redheaded junior said that she was called "red-headed" at least once a day. "It started with, 'You're not as pretty as a redhead'," she said. "I got called a lot of racist things — such as, 'Go back to your country.'"

The sophomore said she doesn't blame the students but thinks the bullying is not just a school problem. She has heard of bullying in other schools and knows many kids feel isolated with their brown hair.

"I think, when you talk about race in America, there's so much hate. We know other people are racist but, 'Oh, they're just joking,"' this student said.

But on campus, redheads seemed to be enjoying the attention and even were encouraged to come up with an anti-bullying event when the school term ends in January.

Samara said she hopes other parents take the issue seriously and that administrators learn from them.

"It's kind of the end of the school year. I want them to really realize that this is something that should really be dealt with."<|endoftext|>The Canadian Press


TORONTO -- An Ontario woman has been found guilty of murdering her toddler daughter with his fist.

Martha Kowalski, 55, was found guilty of second degree murder on Friday following a trial that lasted more than two months.

An expert testified a child cannot die from a single blow to the head.

Kowalski, who has spent 22 years in jail for a previous murder conviction, faces up to 25 years in prison after she is sentenced.

Kowalski attacked her daughter, 3-year-old Elizabeth, near their home on Nov. 22, 1992.

She then suffocated her daughter with a scarf before disposing of the baby corpse in the back yard.

She also allegedly stole the child's brother's identity and gave him to another woman to raise.

Kowalski testified in her own defence that she killed Elizabeth after she learned that her husband had an affair and the two were going to divorce.

The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the second degree murder charge.

The judge presiding over the trial ruled the jury could not convict Kowalski of first degree murder as his verdict on murder would have had to go back to his previous trial.

==================== COMPLETION 32 ====================
 said all of the school's red-haired students were told to stay home that day as a precaution and that "the whole school was out, in a very, very dark, scary mood."

But Samara said the threats on her were real. As students of color, the incidents were particularly painful.

"They can pretend I'm not really an American, just as they've tried to pretend I'm not a redhead," she said.

Kleinfinger said there are people on campus who "try to pick on people like us." The threats, she said, led to a "witch hunt."

Still, she said she has learned to be "sensitive," adding, "If you feel threatened, you should ask the principal" for help.

Meanwhile, some schools around the nation are making it easier for students with red hair to wear a head covering without fear of attacks.

In October, a 7-year-old girl, Elizabeth from San Francisco, sent a letter to students at the high school in which she wore a head covering for the first time.

The Los Angeles Unified School District recently allowed hair to be dyed red in its special-education classes. And last year, the South Carolina State Board of Education voted to allow children enrolled in special-education classes to wear a red hat to school.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which provides support to students with red hair, said there was no evidence that attacks on students with red hair were racially motivated. It said teachers can be helpful and protective.

"We have no data demonstrating a disproportionate percentage of attacks on students with red hair, as opposed to those with other hair colors," said Robin Wilson, executive and legislative director of the association.

Although there is no scientific research that has studied attacks on students with red hair, the association has heard from a lot of parents in the past year.

"We've had calls from parents all over the country saying, 'Please report a red-head assault to law enforcement,' " said Wilson. "We've had calls from parents saying, 'Don't let the school do this to you.' "

The association has reported several cases over the last two years, in which the children who attacked their classmates — typically, white children — were disciplined.

Wilson said, "There is nothing at this point showing that the attacks are racial in nature. And when they are, parents can come forward."

On the other side of the debate are those urging caution.

"There is nothing good that can come of this," said Dan Grossman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Stanford University Schools of Medicine and of Education. "There may well be a case, but it's hard to prove. It's difficult to prove that someone was mentally ill, for example, and was targeting only people with red hair."

There is no easy way to judge whether someone has a mental illness, but even in the most dire situations, doctors consider mental illness a complex, multi-factorial issue that is influenced in no small part by how severe the mental condition is, the severity of the person's symptoms and his treatment history.

"It is hard to determine if someone is in need of help because of his or her red hair or because of something else," Grossman said.

Grossman said the problem also doesn't exist in a vacuum. Although it does not occur frequently — he calls it an "exasperatingly rare" event — he said one out of every 25 people on Earth has red-hair color.

"We think red hair is a recessive genetic tendency, and it's quite possible that someone could have red hair

Q: Which plant-fiber products do we recommend you use?

All plant-fiber products provide composting benefits, and as the amount of plant debris and food matter in your garden diminishes, the amount of waste grows.

Q: What should I do if I cannot find a plant-fib product?

There are several easy and convenient ways to acquire composting and compostable material. Here are some of the easiest ways that you can purchase such materials:

Q: What are the best place to get compostable materials?

There is a range of composting materials we offer at this point. Since we are a small, locally-owned business, our materials are sourced locally. There are three main categories of materials that are used in composting:

Biodegradable Compost

Paper

Plant Fibers

Plant Fibers

Paper compost is the most common type of compost used, as it is the most widely used material in commercial applications, such as in newspaper production, the pulp and paper industry, and many schools. Paper compost consists of about 65% cellulose, 22% lignin, and 1% hemicellulose, plus water. Most commercial paper bins are made with wood pallets or old pallets. When you use paper compost as the primary compost in your garden, the following are acceptable materials to purchase:

Cotton: Any color, from white to black, although not all colors will work.

Q: Why do you use compostable packaging?

With plastic products that contain plastic or polyethylene, the plastic is produced as a byproduct. When you use compostable packaging to store plant-based food or ingredients, you are not using any plastic at all. The plastic does not make its way into your environment. We know that you can't avoid plastic altogether, but making a product out of a compostable material allows it to be made into a compostable product.

Q: So, which packaging to pick?

Plastic: If you're looking for food packaging with compostable packaging, plastic is one option. We recently started distributing one of our packaging options as compostable food packaging – a 1-lb bag of our plant-based flour (pictured). Other options are: a 2-gallon, 100% compostable container, and a 2-gallon, non-compostable container.


Paper: With paper products, some compostable options are: a 3-lb. box of our plant-based protein powder (shown), and a 2x3x3.5-ft. box of our compostable bags.


Coffee Mugs: With coffee cups and containers, you can choose to use a variety of paper and compostable options. Here are some of the options:


Lid: We sell 12-gal. compostable lids for hot plates. This is what comes with your compostable cooler and food item. This box contains two lids: a 3-lb. box of our 100% compostable hot plate lids and a 3-lb. box of our non-compostable lids.


Food: We have a wide array of compostable packaging options for food products. Just use the shopping cart selection (we recommend you click on it if you don't see your product you need).


Q: How do my compostable containers stack up to these options?


There are many similarities between our compostable lids and compostable containers used for coffee cup, and plant-based hot plates. They're both made from a single piece of material. They can also be stacked together to make a compostable cooler. And, they're both compostable and recyclable.


Q: What can be composted in a compostable cooler?

Coffee Mugs and other paper kitchenware, coffee cups, plates, trays, and food can be placed in the compostable cooler. When a compostable cooler is used for composting, the plastic does not end up in the landfill. Our coolers are designed to withstand the heat.

Q: Where else can I purchase compostable products? How does it compare to buying in person?

We are proud to offer both our home composting system and our commercial composting system. We can take the composted products we sell and process them into compost for your home. We're also happy to bring compostable products to you for you to process in-person at one of our facilities. Learn more about our services below!

Q: How long does a recycled product need to be in my refrigerator before it is used to compost?

This depends on the size of the container. Read more about how long it takes to decompose.


Q: I don't have a waste container, how will I dispose of my waste?

A: This depends on the product and where it is coming from. Generally, you can put your waste in the dryer. We also have an online waste bin that will safely send recycling waste to our processing plant from both household and business. Read more about how to dispose of your waste.

Q: How long does it take to compost plant-bound food waste?

A: A simple composting process takes under 12 weeks to achieve the right temperature for the right type of material. When processing large quantities of kitchen waste, as is typically necessary for plant-bound food waste, additional steps (such as adding a binder or other additives) may be required. Read more about how long it takes to compost food waste.

Q: How can I reduce the amount of my compost from going directly to landfills?

We offer a low-input composting option that is a great option for those concerned about how their compost is processed or the level of waste reduction it delivers. By doing our composting in house rather than sending the compost to a landfills, we are able to reduce the amount of compost that goes directly from composting home piles to landfills by as much as 99.4%, without sacrificing our low-input composting process.

Plants need to be fed every year. With wheat straw, plant growth is stimulated every year so even the most efficient composting system will still have to process a quantity of food for the earth every year. This can be prevented by choosing products from plants we have in our community.

Composts made with wheat straw are better quality and are better for the environment. There is no need for chlorine, nitrates, nutrients, and other additives that can harm soil and plants as these are only added during the processing of wood.

Q: Is composting safe for dogs, cats, or small children?

These products are safe for their intended use, however they should never be used if your children are in the home, as they could ingest the food or waste. We do however carry several products specifically for the home composting process. These products are designed to ensure that food and waste are only turned over to the proper container.

Q: What would happen to my composting when it's full?

It would continue to compost. When your composting is full, you should discard the waste in the compost pile.

For more information about composting, please see our product safety webpage.

Q: What is compostable food?

Compostable food, such as fruits and vegetables, is food that will decompose and become food again in the proper method. Compostable kitchen foods have been tested to make sure they would decompose in the correct compost location or compost heap. If you notice any changes to the amount of decomposition that a plant or animal has experienced, such as a plant that is not ready to decompose in your home, then the food you purchased is not compostable.

 But Hermione Granger still always retains a bit of Hermione Granger, no matter how garbled an interpretation of her is (and let me tell you, although Clare had a lot of faults, I thought that her interpretations of the Harry Potter characters were, though not totally accurate, both compelling and interesting). When I opened the book, I knew that Clary was Ginny. Alec was Harry. Isabelle was Clare's version of Blaise (who back then was not officially male or female, and could therefore be interpreted by fandom either way). Valentine was a strange mixture of Lucius and Voldemort. And Jace, of course, was undeniably Draco.

Jace is so Draco, in fact, that it's impossible to see him as his own character. The way Clare characterizes Jace is the exact same way she characterized her Draco. They share lines (the ones she didn't steal from Buffy, of course), they share nervous tics, they share appearances, and they even share memories. The second I read the scene in which Jace tells Clary the story about the boy and the falcon, I felt an unpleasant jolt of recognition: that story is one Draco tells in one of the Draco Trilogy installments. I couldn't remember which one. I couldn't even remember
==================== COMPLETION 37 ====================
 how to describe all those similarities except by referring to the novels, since I'd read so many Draco books. But the scene was an example of how Clare is able to create a Draco who is both both different and identical, so that the reader who loves both her Draco and her Draco and Jace are able to understand the character even when (as in "Clary's Guide to Witchcraft") they can't quite identify them.

One could argue that it would be better to let the reader choose their Draco. But I don't think that's the point. I think the point is that Clare's Draco creates an identity for himself in a way that makes it quite easier to identify with him than it would to identify with Clary and Alec and all the other characters in the books.

I also think the purpose of Draco is to be relatable to children. Many of them can identify with a lot of things, because they are children; but few children can identify with any single character on their own. The characters are not so much relatable as symbolic. They symbolize something that is important to many of their readers; they become something for them that they can identify with, and in the case of Draco, the thing they identify with has a lot to do with having a "voice." It's not enough that I like a character. I identify with her, even if she is my personal favorite character (and I know she's mine as well). For him, I have an entire family. I identify with her because so much of my identity is tied up in what his voice says, says to me, says to her. He says how I feel. I think that's why, so far, he has been one of my favorite characters in the Draco books.

I want to return to Jace, even if it is easier to point to him as Clary's Draco, because I think I have a few words for him. There's one thing they share that Clary doesn't. When Clary tells Jace about the boy and the falcon during their first interaction, Jace tells her, without telling her (or us, for that matter) what he is saying—that it is he who told her, not Godric Gryffindor, not Harry and Ron, or Voldemort—and Clary takes advantage of this to help a little. She is very quick to assume that he is telling her something that must be true, and therefore she wants to believe it. This is a very human impulse; we can see it in many stories. But it's dangerous.

But then there are several things that Clare does to show a little more depth—some of which, I might point out, I can actually relate to now.

For example, Jace is a lot more aware of the difference between men's and women's voices than Clary, or Clary's parents, are aware of the difference between people's voices and their actual genders: he knows that he needs to listen to the voices of his friends, and he is quite adept at doing so.

This is an easy one, but I think one of the ways in which Clare's Draco is more relatable and therefore more important to children is that, although Harry is a boy, he actually comes from a mixed-up family of boys who are not his real parents.

It's something that I have a lot of sympathy with. It's something that I have a lot of sympathy for him trying to figure out. I don't know how anyone does it. I don't know how anyone figures out this. What I can definitely do, though—what I actually do—is to be able to identify with the pain that children feel when trying to figure out just how to tell you

What did bother me was that I couldn't remember the part where Draco says that "there's an old saying that 'only a fool can remember the past'." I remembered it. But it wasn't Clary that I recalled. I thought about Clary. I thought about Valentine. I thought about Isabelle. But what I remembered was Jace.

Claire, by contrast, is a completely different character. She doesn't exist except when she is being clairvoyant. For all Rowling's assurances that she is not taking any of Claire's dialogue from this series, this is a perfect fit for Claire. Claire, in these novels, is everything that happens to Clary, all of which happens in the past.

It's so jarring to imagine the character of Claire not existing in the same books as Clary. It's a bit like suddenly becoming obsessed with the life of the little boy you love so much and can recall so clearly. It's like when the people in your family can remember such a thing, but when you ask them directly, they don't remember all the same details that you do. It's like being an adult. It's like you had a memory from a different life. It's like, well, if you had a memory, that's enough. You're fine.

This all makes a lot more sense in retrospect now, as I've taken some time to reflect on the fact that Claire was Rowling's idea. Claire had no choice but to become the "Clairvoyant" character she was designed to be—or else she would never have been created. There's no way that this character would have been conceived and written if Rowling had not wanted to introduce the character. But as far as the characters of Clary and Claire are concerned, they were created. A little girl's life is suddenly turned upside down. (And as long as I've read the novels, the events leading up to the revelation are always just as jarring. The first time that Clary becomes the Clairvoyant in Hogwarts, she does so with the power to see things that Clary is, as mentioned earlier, unable to perceive. We learn this a few years later–when she's in seventh year at Hogwarts–by way of a very telling epigraph. Here is how the epigraph reads, from the third Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: "Clairvoyance, at least until recently, had been considered a gift of the faint-hearted." Clary's powers grow progressively stronger and her perceptions and memory become ever more sensitive to tiny details. In the Harry Potter novels, she's able to use these powers to do almost everything she uses clairvoyance to do, including: read books for the "magical" history, learn how to use her clairsentience to look for lost objects, read and write stories, and even change the age of the universe to that of a baby bird.)

Because Claire is a character created by Rowling and an important one in the Harry Potter universe, it was important to me that she not only exist, but that she be the best character I could create for her. And because she was meant to represent a real person (Claire as the first time I heard the term clévénage was in an exchange with Claire's father; the term clévénage is French for "child of two"), and because she is such a strong character, I felt that she should be represented as well as possible.

In addition to being Claire, she was also designed to be able to be read as a

 But Hermione Granger still always retains a bit of Hermione Granger, no matter how garbled an interpretation of her is (and let me tell you, although Clare had a lot of faults, I thought that her interpretations of the Harry Potter characters were, though not totally accurate, both compelling and interesting). When I opened the book, I knew that Clary was Ginny. Alec was Harry. Isabelle was Clare's version of Blaise (who back then was not officially male or female, and could therefore be interpreted by fandom either way). Valentine was a strange mixture of Lucius and Voldemort. And Jace, of course, was undeniably Draco.

Jace is so Draco, in fact, that it's impossible to see him as his own character. The way Clare characterizes Jace is the exact same way she characterized her Draco. They share lines (the ones she didn't steal from Buffy, of course), they share nervous tics, they share appearances, and they even share memories. The second I read the scene in which Jace tells Clary the story about the boy and the falcon, I felt an unpleasant jolt of recognition: that story is one Draco tells in one of the Draco Trilogy installments. I couldn't remember which one. I couldn't even remember
==================== COMPLETION 39 ====================
 whether Jace was Draco until I looked it up in the first volume of the Harry Potter books (the "A History of Magic" chapter on how the Order got its name). And that was exactly what Clare wanted.

Clary's story is essentially a series of questions: If Harry Potter had never been born, would Hermione Granger have become Hermione Granger? How would they behave in their first year at Hogwarts? How would the other students (if such exists) treat them, and how might they treat them? Is Draco really who he appears to be? And what about Severus Snape? And is it possible that there is a real person behind Draco Malfoy—or Draco—because he is so, so deeply confused? (It's not a real person who tells Blaise's story, it's just a version of him, as Clare puts it, but he really is a Draco; it's just his words that aren't always consistent with his actions.)

After reading the whole mess of Hermione/Hermione, you might guess that there were only two main characters in that book, Harry and Hermione, which is where Clare ended up. After all, the first paragraph of the Prologue of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone describes just that: Harry Potter, a wand in his hand, and Hermione Granger standing next to him—and it was just before their first year at Hogwarts. Clare's characterization of Blaise was just as interesting—he starts out as just one part of Alec. And Clary's characterization of Ginny, Isabelle, and Jace was just as fascinating: in these books, Clary gives us many characters, none of whom are entirely like the previous one.

There were a lot of things that I missed while reading this book, which is not a complaint in itself. But there were these other bits and pieces that bothered me (and, frankly, not many other readers, because this was also the way that Clare designed her characters, which is why she decided to give some of her characters odd-shaped eyes instead of round), and that annoyed me. When Clare decided to portray Hermione and Harry as best friends and, by default, the two best friends in the Wizarding World, she was off about the idea that "everybody's best friend". She couldn't have been as shocked as she thought at the idea of Draco being a romantic interest of a girl in a "girl group" when they became very close; her reaction is so different than that of a reader or a critic that it was simply hard not to have a response to that—not an unkind one, but just a slight one, so I did. (I'm not going to discuss the actual issue of Hermione's sexuality here, because that hasn't really been a thing that's come up in the Wizarding World ever since the first Harry Potter book.)

Clare isn't the only person who makes Hermione a best friend who also hates Hermione (there's something to be said for a love that is based off of respect, after all); the relationship between Ron and Hermione has the same problem, as does those between Neville and Hermione (the latter of whom develops into an emotionally stable, self-confident sort of person, despite her intense hatred of Hermione, despite Hermione's repeated bouts of emotional outbursts); Remus and Hermione had their differences, but Remus loved her in the end, as well Harry; and in fact, Harry and Hermione are, as Clare puts it, "best friends," and it's hard to dispute that idea.

But Clare's desire to present their friendship as a special thing is pretty different from Rowling's. Rowling was very clear about the basic structure of the Harry Potter books: Harry is the central character, Neville is the second-most

 the character that he was describing, but I remember that this story is Draco telling it in Chapter 2. I remember everything and nothing. I read the book, I watched the movies, I re-watched the films, I re-read the books, I go back after every adaptation, I read more, I re-read more, and the thing is: no matter how much one knows about Draco Draco, the person Clary thinks she's reading is almost identical to Draco in every physical and psychological way. Jace, Clare, and the others are all me. I'm only a partial personality, however, but this person is so close to me that the only way she could have done it would have been to be the exact opposite of me.

What do I do with that knowledge, however, of my own duplicity? How do I reconcile the fact that I'm the one who, in writing this entry, made myself out to be someone I was not? Well, I'm not sure, really. I'm glad, though, that we finally have an answer: that it was Clare. Clary has a huge part to play in the Harry Potter universe, a central one in a lot of ways, and in this book, she proved herself a perfect vessel for what is, ultimately, a story about a person who is more than Draco: she was Draco, the author is Clary, and her interpretation of all the characters is Clary's.

When I first read the Harry Potter series, in the summer of 1997, I knew exactly who Draco was and where he came from: he was a boy who lived in an orphanage, and he got into trouble with the other kids in the orphanage and was expelled. I had only known him in his Draco mode, and I knew that Draco was just my Draco. (Now, I have been able to identify Draco's gender in several different ways: Harry, for one, sometimes refers to Draco as being female, and other times simply as "he" – the one with curly hair and glasses, the one who is a bit of a dork, the one who can charm the ladies with a few lines of dialogue.) I knew that he was Harry's best friend and that they had had an awful time at Hogwarts, both because of Harry's death and because of Draco and their fight in the library, and I knew their parents died, and I knew who their parents were, especially since Hermione gave an awful description of the Malfoys' last year at Hogwarts. I knew that they were evil, and that they were both Slytherins. I knew, at the time, that Harry Potter, the boy on the front of the book, was really Draco Malfoy. (Even when the first movie came out, I kept hearing the lines about Draco and Harry being friends and friends only: it was a thing that I knew to be true, and had always, for the first few years of their friendship, assumed to be so.) I knew that Draco's parents died and that he had to move schools after that to avoid bullying (this, to me, was the central conflict of their friendship and the true story of both Harry and Draco), and that he eventually became a Death Eater and betrayed Harry multiple times in order to protect his secret. So, as I said, my Draco was my Draco.

But I also knew that Clary had to be a partial personality, because if I was going to write a true Draco, I couldn't do it with "the first Harry Potter fanfiction author." When I began writing my novel Draco, I wanted to tell the story of Draco Malfoy from Clary's perspective. And there is a great temptation to do this: as we all know: the fact that I wrote

 away from controversial topics (including climate change, Planned Parenthood, the TPP, trade, immigration and the NSA) in an effort to put himself in position to appeal to voters skeptical of a Trump presidency. In the end, he didn't, but nonetheless came out ahead.

The final round (in which each of the five candidates who finished in the top four was invited to the stage) was more of a repeat, with a slightly more muted tone from Trump. This is a disappointing outcome for the GOP, whose top contenders have made some decent inroads with conservative audiences by presenting issues in a serious way. He got the bulk of the first three hours.

Overall, it was a rather quiet and unremarkable evening, with the exception of a couple of good moments for Cruz. The debate was more a product of his being the leader.

This debate was a reminder that the Republican Party's biggest threat to its political future doesn't come from other candidates, but from the media.

That said, if Trump isn't going to get the Republican nomination, he's at least putting a dent in some rather important issues and issues-informative debates.<|endoftext|>Barry O'Reilly

Barry O'Reilly's father (left) is among those calling on the NFL to punish the Washington Redskins for allegedly mocking Native Americans during Thursday's "Redskins" game, while the team denies the charge.

Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder has a history of making inflammatory comments towards Native Americans. The team has a history of mascots and team names that are derogatory towards the Native Americans who called Washington home for thousands of years.

On Thursday night, Washington blew a 22-0 lead in their game against the St. Louis Rams, thanks in large part to a Redskins' defensive unit that was called off of the field due to a knee injury. Snyder's name was called and Redskins players responded by taking a knee before the game had even been under way.

Now, four days later, there are calls for a fine and a ban from future games.

Snyder released a statement on Thursday saying that if the Redskins "misstepped" (I've italicised the word misstepped) and called off the rest of their defense, then they should have been fined. He added that he was "disappointed" in his players and that "it is never on the coaches" to decide whether or not to call off the rest of the defense.

However, he then claimed that he hadn't intended to do anything, and that the team's defense called off of the field was a part of the game itself. This is not true. The team's head defensive coach, Joe Barry, and the unit's defensive backs coach, John Butler, were both taken off of the field by the coaching staff to be evaluated on Thursday night.

There is also video evidence of the Redskins players calling off the rest of their defense following the Rams victory. In the clip, first posted by The Post's Dan Steinberg, they can be seen talking to a referee before calling for an official to come onto the field. They can then be seen taking their knees again when the official comes onto the field. The player in the video with Butler is the head defender Barry claims did NOT call off his defense.

As you can see, the entire defense is still on the field when the official arrives and there are still Redskins players on the field. Barry also admitted that a few of his players would've liked to stay on the field, according to Steinberg:

Barry — who acknowledged that "a couple of the more passionate and passionate" players who wanted to remain on the field might have been able to stay — said he had heard from one

But it's up to you, you have to come out and say, 'That's not right.

 away from a direct confrontation on a number of issues. His forceful defense of the right to vote was perhaps the stand-out moment of the night, and it was no surprise that he did the best when it counted the most. This may be the night that he finally breaks free from the GOP establishment machine and becomes that star-fucker that he so desperately wants to be. It is a moment that we are all looking to see, and he did it. But while one of the best debaters on the stage, his performance was not enough to gain him a majority on the stage, and his lack of foreign policy knowledge and knowledge of basic constitutional process left a bad taste in my mouth.Finally, let's move beyond the debates and look back to who had the best performances over the course of the evening:The most entertaining debate of the evening was a clash between the two most unpredictable personalities in presidential politics. Trump and Cruz were not in lockstep throughout, and, especially in the latter debate, had a fair amount of spats and even insults. The main storyline of this debate was Cruz's inability to stick to Trump, which is something that he's had trouble with before and may have difficulty doing again here. Trump on the other hand was much more at home in New York, and I'd argue that in this debate he was less focused on Cruz -- he was too busy attacking the moderators, as he did throughout the evening -- but that's OK from the Trump perspective, he's not the one who won the debate, he's the one who gets to play Trump in the debates and he's just as entertaining and entertaining while doing that as Cruz is while playing Cruz.The other thing I noticed on this debate night, as it relates to how the debates have gone so far in the primaries, was that the moderators seemed far more interested in getting a one-on-one between these two politicians and letting them go at it than they were in actually asking substantive questions, if only because it was so much funnier watching the candidates engage in meaningless schoolyard insults and name-calling.In an earlier edition of the debate, Cruz called Trump a "con artist and a serial philanderer," suggesting that he could not be trusted as president, which Trump denied. In the current debate, Cruz referred to Trump as "a little Marco" again, and Trump did not deny it.In this debate alone, Trump called Cruz "Lyin' Ted" at least four times, and Trump also called Cruz a "liar", which he denied. I'm sure we'll be hearing similar stuff from these two characters and many more in the days, weeks and months to come, even if they are not the two that end up winning the nomination.The other thing that is worth noting about this debate night: this was the second debate in a row in which Trump and Cruz both seemed less confident and seemed to have less confidence as a result of the experience of last night. If they fail to make an impact tomorrow night in their second matchup with each other, that will likely further strengthen the argument that Trump is a more capable general election contender than Cruz, which could lead to more establishment/neoconservatives/Republican moderates abandoning Cruz altogether and handing the nomination to Trump at a contested convention.Trump's performance was not the best of the night, but still a great one, as we've already seen. I've been having a really good time watching this spectacle. And then there were some people<|endoftext|>The second season premiered Sunday, and fans are going to be ecstatic. But it's time we take a step back and consider what a masterpiece this show has truly become.

 away from controversial issues and taking on Trump in a substantive manner that I believe won him supporters and viewers. It will be very interesting to see how his demeanor improves over time - it's currently a little unhinged. The Republican National Committee had to be encouraged by the inclusion of Rubio in the last debate, though, after his disastrous showing in the first two. He showed better poise, and did better homework on Trump in the last debate, but still appeared more comfortable attacking Ted Cruz and "low energy" Jeb Bush than debating Trump. He had little success in closing the deal on the Trump-Kasich sparring match, which, as usual, may have contributed to the lack of depth of both participants.

The debate, at times, was more of a slog by comparison to the first two. The first two were fast paced, energetic, and engaging and, at times, got down to brass tacks, discussing crucial policy issues, debating issues that matter to voters, and engaging in lively exchanges over substantive matters. They were focused, passionate debates, and the candidates were in full force from the very beginning.

On paper, the third debate should have been a much-improved outing for the Republicans, but was anything close to such?

As it turned out, the only real drama, in the end, didn't relate to politics but rather to the candidates' health. Trump's health status may have been what most people were concerned about, and was a reason his performance has taken a dip in the ratings in the wake of his debate performance. But at the same time, his coughing fit was the reason the Fox News moderator, Chris Wallace, repeatedly asked Cruz a question on Trump's health and noted, "you said it's not your problem."

There were some tense moments during the debate when the candidates discussed issues on the floor, such as the Affordable Care Act and immigration, but the substantive policy discussions were a bit lacking. It might have been a more substantive debate had there been a question or two that related to major policy issues instead of just attacking each other.<|endoftext|>In case anyone was confused, the next time you're in a bar, a public library, a coffee shop, or even the park with your parents and want to read a book, all you need is your smartphone -- or a tablet.

Google made this abundantly clear today by announcing it will be offering a new app called "My Library." When you download it on your smartphone or tablet, the app will present you with a list of books on the device you want to read. You can filter this list by title, author, language, or genre, and it will even let you buy an e-book (of course).

The list that is being offered for free today is only a starting point -- it will expand as technology improves and Google continues to add new library content. What's interesting, however, is that, in order to browse the list of available e-books, you'll need to use a smartphone or tablet with Google's latest mobile operating system. There's a pretty good argument that many of these e-books available through Google's My Library app don't fit the standard definition of e-books -- a Kindle doesn't technically constitute an e-book, for example.

The company says that it will continue to keep this new app as free -- I don't know how that will work, though -- and it's not clear when it will be made available for Android and other mobile vendors.<|endoftext|>An anonymous reader writes:

Kate laughed nervously and scratched at the newly shaved spot on her head with a little shrug. "It is. But the same friends who helped me get ready are the ones who sold me the tickets. They couldn't make it tonight or their plans changed or something. They couldn't believe it when I told them I'd buy the tickets."

Chloe flashed an appreciative smile at Kate as she turned toward the downtown area. "You can tell me to shut up if I'm being too pushy, but... Seriously, you know you didn't have to go all-out like this. What's the deal?"

There was a bit of all-too familiar fumbling in the passenger seat. "It's like I said, I guess. I don't spend nearly as much time with you as I do the others. And I want to! But I just... I-I don't know..."

"Is this a guilt thing, Katie?"

"No! I mean, well yeah a little, but I do honestly want to spend more time with you. I suppose it's just that I think I'm not cool enough?" Though phrased like a question,
==================== COMPLETION 49 ====================
 it was almost an accusation, more directed at the other woman than at Kate. "And that's sort of a shame, but I mean, yeah, if it makes you feel better."

Chloe glanced back and forth in the rearview before sighing and looking back at them. "I think I might be. I guess the one time in a while I've really enjoyed spending time with you has been when we've just been chilling. That seems like, I mean I've had other moments when that's helped me feel better about stuff, but not a lot. Not enough to make me want to commit suicide. I just kinda feel uncomfortable around you, you know?"

For that, Chloe felt a little guilty about taking that tone of voice to Kate. For now at least. It was kind of unfair to assume she was being rude or spiteful, even if she knew her intentions were a bit questionable. Her own behavior felt a lot more like spite than any kind of genuine concern about Kate's feelings. For her part, Kate knew deep down it had been a mistake.

Kate had a little too much going through her head by herself all the time. Maybe that was the reason Kate didn't want to be around Chloe for a long time. That little voice in her head needed to be calmed and, to that end, it was probably best the two stayed friends. The moment Chloe took any action that would drive that voice more and more towards her or away from her, she'd only worsen things and become unbearable to deal with in every possible way.

Chloe's thoughts turned back to the day she'd discovered Chloe's little secret.

"How much did you...?" Kate began as she glanced up from the road to look over Kate's shoulder at the other woman.

"A total of... nine bucks?" Chloe laughed uneasily. "You could say that."

"And what were you thinking?" Kate looked surprised and a little disappointed.

"I know that it's not really fair for you to ask, but that was a hell of a lot of money to pay for the tickets." Chloe shrugged. "I mean, I thought about it a lot for sure, but my father and everyone else said no, they couldn't afford it."

"You had a few options," Kate pointed out.

"You could try to figure things out on your own. I would have told you, even if I didn't think you would have had that much faith. I think it would have been easier if I'd just said it was too expensive, but I'm too trusting for that. Plus, I felt like there was a chance you could have got that for less."

"That means you're really glad I didn't tell you," Kate sighed with a sigh of relief. "Thanks for that, I appreciate it."

"But don't think I don't understand." Chloe looked into Kate's eyes. "I know you don't want to put your life on the line - even though I'm a fucking miracle. And I wouldn't blame you if you didn't trust me. There's nothing I wouldn't do to keep my promises and, as I said, sometimes I don't give a fuck about the consequences... Even at my age, I've done some pretty stupid things. Sometimes I just need someone, someone I trust, to be there when I fuck up." Chloe reached up with her left hand and brushed some hair from her head. The fingers curled lightly over her hair and Kate saw the same look of doubt she had seen on Chloe's face earlier as Chloe looked into Kate's eyes. "I've done a lot of dumb things and they all just seem innocent in retrospect,

Kate laughed nervously and scratched at the newly shaved spot on her head with a little shrug. "It is. But the same friends who helped me get ready are the ones who sold me the tickets.

 the words were something Chloe had heard Kate say more often than not over the last year, at least in public.

"Oh?" Chloe could hear Kate's eyes bugging out as she tried to recall the last time she'd heard an actual statement similar to the one she'd just made. "That's... I don't know... I kinda feel the same way." Kate could feel a tinge of guilt in her stomach as she realized that even knowing there was no shame with Kate and whatever she was feeling, she had to agree with the decision to pull back a bit.

Not that any of that had anything to do with Jack, but at least she didn't have to deal with the man anymore. It wasn't fair, but she still had to consider his feelings even if she didn't entirely agree with them. "So... You wanna hang out? Go have fun? Meet new people?" Chloe asked. "Like I said, I know you guys don't spend much time together, but you can still help each other out. You guys could even hang out when you have time and have fun. Or if you don't really want to, you could just hang out and... meet people from other worlds or something?"

There was the slightly amused smirk from earlier. "That is one way we can do that. Actually, it's one of the best ways. I'm gonna go get them." Kate called to the back window of the car, "Good luck."

The road out of Arcadia Bay was winding, one-way off-ramps that were dotted with traffic lights that all seemed to be red and yellow while the rest were clearly blinking. Chloe smiled at her friend as she hopped out of the car and walked toward the traffic lights. "Hey, man."

"Hey, Chloe."

"You look happy right now."

"You look like you're having one of your happy thoughts."

"So? That means I'm not having them right now. I mean, who says you go through those anyway?"

Chloe chuckled as she climbed onto the overpass. "Yeah, you know, not like I didn't have them when you got me started. But... well what'd you call it when I was about four years old? 'Happiness is what you make of it'," Chloe said with a laugh as she watched Kate walk the rest of the way to the exit.

"Well, maybe if you'd just keep them to yourself for three years and then put them in, that might have ended up being more like my happy thoughts. Like, if you could just do anything you please," Chloe said with a shake of her head. "Just be happy or whatever. Even if I'd never have heard of them before."

Kate's grin widened and she turned around with an out-of-character grin on her face. "Hey, there's something you don't know about me, Chloe. I really like to talk about my happy thoughts. Like I said, we have them here in my head."

Chloe had to struggle not to grin as she walked on her own path to the exit, looking to see if there were any other humans in the car. She stopped in front of the last passenger that had been sitting in the seat, who saw her and rolled down the window in an attempt to hide his face behind his hands.

"Hey!" Chloe called out, looking down at the man. As she did, his eyes snapped open. "You were listening, right? Because right now, your happy thoughts may be all I have, so I'm not going to let you go back to them."

"Oh, Chloe." This was

Kate laughed nervously and scratched at the newly shaved spot on her head with a little shrug. "It is. But the same friends who helped me get ready are the ones who sold me the tickets.

 the line that the girl had said felt something else, like a warning or a hint. Or just the tip of a secret iceberg. Kate couldn't be sure how this was all related to her own feelings for the redhead, and was unsure of how the girl would take that news.

Chloe just stared at her, taking a breath to try and get it out. It took many tries, but eventually she managed. "I'm your best friend. I love you. I hope you're as fine with me being your best friend as I am with you. Just... Don't ask me, ok? Okay? It's just... There's just somethin' I want you to hear."

Kate stared blankly at the redhead for what she hoped was a long time. Then she finally looked up. "Huh?"

Chloe just grinned and held up one index finger. "You never asked. I didn't ask. And you didn't ask me either. Why?" She waited a moment, then nodded to the driver-side window. "I'm kinda... I'm kinda gay." She gave Kate a wide, goofy grin and waited for the blonde to react one way or the other.

It took her over 20 seconds, but Kate managed to do it. "Oh my God. You ARE gay."

They were the few moments during the journey that the two of them had spent together without Chloe's constant reminders of who she was, without the constant worry. Even with the way Chloe's eyes were wide and her posture slumped, Kate could feel the tension lift from within her. "Me too." She said, before realizing that this was probably not going to be enough to put an end to Chloe's current, ever-present frown. "You're not? You don't believe me?"

Chloe's smile slowly grew. "No. I believe you. I'm just confused." She looked around at all the open and closed vehicles as she pulled the car to a halt. Kate felt her stomach drop at her friend's awkwardness. As if she was an idiot, Chloe kept staring out the window.

"What's wrong?"

Chloe's look wavered and it took a short moment, before she gave in. "I don't know. It's just been bothering me recently... For a few days now, I'm like... What are you thinking, Kate?" She looked out the window again, her eyes wide and her face pale. "I thought you liked me?"

"I do."

"Okay," she sighed with a little shake of her head. Her friend took a moment to look up at her again. "Well... Well it's just... I don't know... Just... I'll try not to think about it too much." Chloe gave Kate a small kiss on the cheek.

Kate was momentarily taken aback at the sudden change of pace, but she quickly adjusted to their new setting. "Oh, wow. Well, all right, I guess, since you're a big girl now." Not entirely sure how that statement would be received, Kate tried to think of the best way to return the gesture. "So... So... You never had a girlfriend before?"

"No, no." With a small smirk, Chloe turned around to place her forehead against her knees. "But I thought I'd been with one when you were just a child."

"Oh. I guess that's what happens sometimes, huh?"

"We'll have to get you some friends soon, huh?"

For some reason, Kate wasn't quite ready to believe that just yet. "Well, yes, I guess you're right. I could see

Kate laughed nervously and scratched at the newly shaved spot on her head with a little shrug. "It is. But the same friends who helped me get ready are the ones who sold me the tickets.

==================== COMPLETION 52 ====================
 Kate could practically see Chloe sigh over it.

Chloe paused slightly, her eyebrows squirming. "Katie... What? You don't want me to go out with you because you're afraid you're not cool enough for me?"

Kate nodded slowly, trying to process what she'd just heard. "I don't know how to answer that," she finally said, looking down at herself.

Then she felt like she really needed to take a deep breath. The moment of weakness was starting to bite her, but for some reason it was a relief to be in her car behind Chloe with her back toward her.

"I want to spend as much time as I can with you, Max," Kate assured her. "It's just... I want to spend time with you! I want to go on a date! I want to do stuff!"

It came out in such a rush, she almost had to yell at herself. Chloe didn't seem to notice at all.

Then Kate decided that she wasn't going to try and argue with Chloe any further. She would be there for Max, even if Max didn't want to be there for her, if she didn't want to be, at least that was how it felt right now.

The car stopped at Max's first apartment and they quickly made their way inside. Chloe stepped inside first, her arms loosely crossed across her chest. Kate followed close behind.

Max opened the door to the apartment and stood with her back turned to the girl who was now standing right next to her. She looked so much like Kate. Maybe she should talk to her before things got awkward. Maybe talk to her for a moment would do Max some good.

Kate took a deep breath. "Max!" Kate started.

"Oh. Kate. Sorry... I'm just so tired. I'm... I'm so sorry I couldn't do anything! I was... I'm getting really tired just having this conversation."

Kate's hand shot out and rested at Max's shoulder, pulling her into a tight hug. Kate squeezed her tightly and gave a slight squeeze back.

Max squeezed Kate's hand as she tried to sit up.

"I can't be mad at you," Kate told her. "I feel like I'd never be angry with you. I just... I just feel bad. Max you just have a lot going on that makes it hard for you to get dates... You have to be so busy and your life is so incredibly stressful."

Max started to get up but Kate had her pinned by the shoulder and made a small "come here" gesture as she did, pulling Max to her. Chloe made a face as she realized she was staring at this two year old and didn't think it a good idea to break it.

"Oh, hey Kate. I'm sorry about that. I guess I wasn't able to keep up." Max gave a shaky laugh, trying to keep some of that energy she felt from Kate to herself. "I'm just so tired and I didn't want to leave you waiting."

"Oh, so Chloe's the one who's always making you wait?" Kate inquired. "I thought you were good on the dating front."

"Thanks for worrying about me Kate. Thank you for... trying to help me."

Kate smiled and squeezed her right back. "Don't let me stop trying I promise I won't if you don't want me to," she said, her smile a little weak but sweet.

"I know you'll try," Max assured her. "I know you might even end up with a date!" Kate was beginning to regain her composure as Kate began

 LOVES his TUFF Cot Raised Aluminum Bed. He's had it several weeks now and has not had a bite on it (yet!!) I'm giving this bed four out of five stars because not only does it have more durable materials than most dog beds, but I have not found a dog bed that is as good value for your money... The only other thing I would consider to improve this bed is to have a better handle shape. My dog has a tiny bit of a claw hold on the handle that causes it to dig into his leg and leg pads. I would be really happy if I could get my dog to try it without it taking up too much house space on the shelf... He just sits there and scratches at his bed...


And, of course, if you need any other information, just contact us!


Thanks again for an excellent product!


Update: Two months into using this bed, and so far, so good (with no issues.) My dog, who has chewed up every type of dog bed and carpet, hates his TUFF Cot Raised Aluminum Bed. And I can totally understand--the dog bed comes with a no chew guarantee (so, if your pet chews it up, send it back to us), and the bed has a protective zipper cover.


If you're like me, and you're worried about leaving your Tuff Cot Raised Aluminum Bed laying around for a month or more, the manufacturer recommends that it be stored in a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid, if the dog can't chew through the plastic.


Update: We purchased this TUFF Cot Raised Aluminum Bed together last year. After receiving it and starting to use it, I noticed that my dog is now getting along just fine. However, I noticed that my dog had a habit of throwing his bed after he chewed up the other one. I started doing research on the best and most durable beds for dog beds.

I finally just bought a new bed and bedding for my 1 year old puppy, but since I'm no longer using it, I'm going to make another post with his info.

I'll update this review about 2 months from now, since we've left the first one behind.

Update 7/13/16- I'm currently using the original TUFF Bed and bedding we bought a year ago, and it hasn't caused any issues. In the meantime, I am also using a large ceramic dish (about 30 in diameter), about 2" from the edge of the bed, which I have in case of emergencies. Our dog has chewed it up but has not taken any bites yet. She's still very much a house-training breed, and I would rather have her chew every other bed/dish, than every bed/dish!

Update 6/5/12- We've been using our dog's original Tuff Cot Raised Aluminum bed...the ones shown in the picture- and it has held up just fine.<|endoftext|>"It seems like they're only there [on Wednesday] for the games. How do you take a guy who's been here all of a year, been called up from the minors multiple times, been an impact player in the playoffs, and then go there and watch him just sit there and get his ass handed to him by everybody else for nothing.

I ordered these beds two nights ago and the next day she chewed up a hole in one! This has been going on for two weeks now so I'm not so sure about its durability. It has been in two rooms and there is only one bed left to go! This has been going on for two weeks now so I'm not so sure about its durability.

Cot Raiser Love the Cot Raiser. Great product. I have a 6 month old GSD who chews up every bed I give him. He chewed several holes in the crate liner. I tried to do a DIY patch that would be attached to the crate liner, but the holes he pulled out. So I ordered the Cot Raiser and she has kept my dog nice and comfy. Love her.

TUFF Bed K9 baller crate pad. So far it's been great. My dog has not even tried to chew it, not once. Can't say enough good things. It would be cheaper to buy the Tuff Bed for the cost of the crate pad, but I love that I only pay for the one. We have two dogs; he chews up a bed every so often. So far in 3 days the Tuff bed is holding up like a champ! I don't know why most dog beds don't last for more than 5 days when I've tested.

Great bed for large dogs Great product, my 10yo Lab has managed to chew through the corners. Only a few holes so far

Best bed ever I bought this bed when my dog got destroyed. We had it delivered and it was less than a month late. I couldn't be happier. He loves it. I wish the warranty was longer.

First time consumer I was buying a new bed, and we were in a rut with the other dog's so we went to the pup lounge. I was looking for a dog bed that would be a simple, light, easy to clean, and inexpensive bed for our 2 month old pup. I was a little hesitant about the Tuff Crate Pad, because the customer reviews seemed to be bad and our dogs would go through it easily. I saw this one in action (with the dog beds that I own) and knew I could deal with the fact that the dog was going through a little more of a mess than my other beds. When we moved in the next night and he had to go through it we knew the bed would be durable. Even when we put it in the car, and went about our business, he didn't complain about it at all. We were quite nervous to have it move into our family room, as we have other dogs and they are not much of chewer. He didn't bother them at all, and they are so much more peaceful knowing they don't have to go through the carpet. So far this bed is holding up to our dog for the first time, and we are sure she just won't be going too long without it, and that is quite good because after 3 days she has gone through it two more times and the corners are all torn up. I am a little worried and unsure about the durability, but I will be sure to follow up

The Cujo Cot, on the other hand, has a special no-chew design that was specifically created to stump even the worst of bed destroyers. It's the only bed we have that we rate a 5 out of 5 in terms of durability, and while it won't stop bullets, it'll stop 99% of chewers. Of course this bed is covered under our warranty, so make sure to send an email to our warranty department ( [email protected] ) with a photo of the damage if you have not already done so, so that they can get a claim started for you.

Update I just wanted to say we still have both the dog beds we bought a year ago and both are still in very good condition. I'm pleased that the beds have lasted so well.


Thanks!


So far so good! My dog
==================== COMPLETION 55 ====================
 LOVES the TUFF, but I'm still trying to get her to eliminate outside the crate or in her crate. She can't seem to find a way to make it go inside. She's the biggest kibble eater I've had since I've had my first puppy...she gobbles through anything she can get her paws on. Recently I tried giving her the TUFF bed because it was just a bit smaller than her current Kong Toy. She loved it, and the dog bed was a HUGE improvement over my old Kong Toy. I even tried using it in the crate instead of my Kong Toys. But then it started to come time to remove the dog bed, and I realized she wouldn't go through a new Kong Toy in the crate. I was a little worried since I love her new Kong Toy, but she got the idea of removing the Kong when I put it in the crate. So I put it back in the crate, even though it still hadn't gone in the bed yet. At that moment, I noticed the dog bed had gone into the bottom of the crate, which was a few feet from our foot. So I took it out, gave it a good sniff, and then put it back in the crate. So far so good.

Doggie Love!! I bought this for my 4 year old Dachshund after seeing the reviews online and after going to the local rescue rescue groups when he couldn't be found. The crate pad is perfect. It fits him perfectly. And I can't thank you enough for making such a wonderful product. I have recommended your company (and our home) to anyone and everyone who will listen. Thank You!

TUFF Bed My dog ate the bed and then ate the crate pad :(

Great I'm the one who originally thought of giving this pad to our Doberman. It has been a very good dog crate pad and a welcome change over our old "crate liners" from PetSmart. We've had it a few weeks now, and so far so good for her and our other dog. I did feel there were better products out there. She loves it, and she hasn't left the crate since we got it and still hasn't had a chew (she'll just lay in her own poop). The only complaint we have is that she is starting to eat her own bedding, so if you're thinking of switching over to a better bed, I'd start with this bed.

TUFF Bed Crate Pad Great product for our 7 month old Lab who chews anything she can get inside. I bought this crate pad after giving many review and getting no comments. She seems to enjoy it and we think she's better off in it. She hasn't yet tried to chew it, but I did give her a treat when she did try it. My dog didn't have to take her dinner from us in 6 months but she has had the bed. Thanks again for the great product!

Best Crate Pad I've Ever Used I gave my 4 year old border collie a Tuff Bed crate pad. It was like he owned the room. He loves his crate - even though he digs in the sides.


His current bed was a pain to get the blankets out (we tried to keep clean) and there were a lot of holes. The Tuff Bed is much much better! He loves his Tuff bed and hasn't had a problem with it until now. He seems to have put a "gash" in the back of the Tuff Bed. It has just had some stuffing removed, so the "gash" is still there. I'm very curious if his damage to the bed is more psychological or is it real? I feel as bad for my

==================== COMPLETION 56 ====================
 was chewing on bedding (a soft, fluffy bed) today while I was taking a shower. So I had my husband take a picture (which he has done many times in the past), and my dog immediately fell asleep. I had not heard the noise from the shower in full swing yet, but I knew someone in the house had made a sound so I quickly moved into the shower. While washing my hair I heard more loud noises. Then I heard a loud "click" and then my dog started barking really loud again. I came out to find out that our new dog bed is in one of two distinct pieces. The other piece is still in the crate. It was in the crate with my dog the previous night and when he tried to chew on it he destroyed a piece of it (I have a hard time believing he has that much determination to tear it up in this way) and took most of the fabric covering the bottom of the crate. When I got home the other end of the bed was just as bad as the one in the crate. I got him out of the crate today and took him to the kennel to get him out of this thing. The first thing he did was he proceeded to chew and scratch on the other piece of dog bed. After he got the other piece of it out of the crate, he started chewing and scratching on it again and the crate piece again. I will say he started destroying both pieces at the same time. Then we went through and got a brand new dog bed.

We love it! I'm 5'3" and a 60 lbs male. I don't consider myself a picky eater. I am a very active dog that loves to play and run around a lot. I had been looking for beds that would last and do so in a secure manner. I wanted it light in weight so it wouldn't bother my older dog. I had never tried a bed that was this light. A lot of dogs are able to tear it up. They were able to tear the stuffing and stuff inside as well. Our 5 year old beagle loves it and loves being able to sleep up there at night! He hasn't tried to chew it yet. Also, my wife loves that she can finally move around or have her space, when our dog was in the crate.

Chewy! My pitbull would chew up anything he could lay his big teeth on. I used to buy dog beds and dog toys from the local Walmart. One day I stumbled across this dog bed on a shelf at Walmart. I got it, hung it in the living room, and was just a little disappointed when she just kept chewing on it. I tried to feed it to her anyway. I had just bought a new dog so I wasn't worried about losing it. Boy, was I wrong! She ripped it right down to the seams! At first I was shocked and worried but since then I have only used it in the crate and for bedtime. I really hate to say it but there is no getting used to it. It was definitely worth the price of admission and the wait. It is made of quality material and is so worth the money - a lot MORE than the other dog beds I tried!

Great Product! I am a big, strong-mouth, dog/mommy/pets lover. That just means to me, I don't like to let others put down my food for me and my children. So after some research (I read on other pages that it had been tough) a friend had just ordered a very similar product, which she thought was great, so I took a chance on it. I also read the reviews, but they didn't seem to help me understand exactly what kind it was or what

DCS: L-39 Albatros Update


Work continues on the L-39 with the primary focus being on the ZA version. Once the ZA version is complete, we will also add the new training missions and move the L-39 out of beta.


A Review of DCS Versions


At this time we have three different versions of DCS World available and we understand that some of you may be a little confused. In order to provide more clarity, here is what you need to know:


Ver. 1.2. This is the current released (stable) version of the game that includes all modules except the Nevada DLC map and L-39. It however uses our older graphics engine.

You can download it here:


Ver. 1.5. This version includes all the same content as Ver. 1.2, but uses the new graphics engine. At the end of December 2015, we plan to move Ver. 1.5 out of Open Beta and make it the new released (stable) version.
==================== COMPLETION 57 ====================
 However, this time we will not be including Nevada DLC.


Ver. 2.0. This is a new version, called Version 2.0, that incorporates the Nevada DLC map and L-39. Also included is a new L-39 variant (not in the Nevada DLC, but included there). Version 2.0 also adds an additional 3th mission for L-39, in which the ZSU-23-4 Shilka intercepts an MiG-23. The L-39 is now able to be used in all missions of the Nevada DLC.

You can download Version 2.0 right here:


If you are interested in the history of DCS World, we include a historical overview here:


There you will also find important information about DCS Version 2.0, including download links.


DCS: MiG-29 Flaming Cliffs Update


The Flaming Cliffs terrain is an additional world map on the map selection screen. This new map features new terrain features and some of the same aircraft are available. However, the new maps are not compatible with the other DCS World maps so you must either use the current versions with Flaming Cliffs, or find another map to fly on.


The two maps are compatible with each other because they're separated by a distance of about 25kms.


Flaming Cliffs terrain features:

Three large, uninhabited islands with new weather types. The new map features all the same weather types as Nevada, plus new visual effects.

Small, uninhabited island, which is perfect for flying a Mirage-M/Ka-50. The island is also a strategic bombing location for the Russians so be aware of that.

Two other new radar-absorbing islands.

New buildings, including a new HQ with a helipad to refuel aircraft from.

Flaming Cliffs is another map that includes airfields; however, unlike Nevada, you won't be able to fly over them. In addition, the airfields have been moved up to the mountain ranges so you may need to fly at higher altitudes.


The MiG-29 is compatible with Flaming Cliffs, as well as two of the other three DCS World maps with new aircraft, but only the Mirage-M/Ka-50 is playable in the Flaming Cliffs map.


DCS World Operations Mode Changes


The first thing you'll notice in Operation Arrowhead is that the map is larger, so we've added some additional controls. For example, you can turn the lights on/off, adjust the pitch of the aircraft, and the camera is also swiveled around.


For DCS World users, there is new default keybindings for the following:

Mousewheel for the pitch

MOUSE2 for the roll

MOUSE3 for the control

MOUSE4 for the HUD

These are just a few of the new controls that are available. The default controls are accessible via "H" on the keyboard.

Please send us your videos, pictures, and feedback and we will include it in a future update.- Some fixes have been made to ensure that the L-39 now flies more smoothly and accurately. We have adjusted the flight parameters and added a few new flight parameters, such as a faster maximum speed and better turn performance in the YAW control.The L-39 Albatros has received a large number of improvements, mainly focusing on accuracy. Since there are no ground data available for the L-39, as the plane is flown over the ground it is not possible to get exact data for every small detail. One of the most significant improvements has been to increase the minimum airspeed required to reach high speeds, so that the L-39 can properly meet its performance specifications at those higher airspeeds. The L-39 now flies at a slightly faster speed than before at higher airspeeds, which means that it can reach slightly higher altitudes. The L-39 has also been adjusted for a slightly faster stall speed, allowing it to handle a more "narrowly" planned approach to an airport. The L-39 is now an excellent training aircraft, as the higher speeds for which the aircraft was designed allow for a more relaxed airfield training approach. The following are some of the major improvements made:

DCS: Mi-8MTV2 Magnificent Seven Update


Due to the long release cycle of our DCS: Mi-8MTV2 aircraft, there will not be any additional updates to this aircraft over the next few months as we complete the full implementation of the full AI system.


DCS: L-39 Albatros and P-51D Mustang


Two new L-39 series aircraft are now being planned for DCS World, the L-39ZA "Pilatus" and the P-51D "Mustang". Both aircraft were designed to perform the roles of a bomber escort and a close air support (CAS) aircraft in different environments. The L-39ZA has the unique ability to fly extremely high and rapidly under their own power.

The L-39ZA will be modeled using the same high-resolution textures that make up the "Flaming Carpet" map in DCS: Mi-8MTV2 with an additional amount of detail added.


The P-51D will be modeled as both a World War II era and modern style aircraft. It will feature the full set of 3D sounds that are currently available for DCS: F-86F Sabre and DCS: Mi-8MTV2 and will also include the sounds appropriate for its configuration.

Both aircraft will have their own unique and advanced mission system. The P-51D's mission system has been greatly improved to accommodate the new mission system and will support long-form missions in addition to daily and weekly short-form missions, and in-depth campaigns with multiple endings.

Celtic could rely on more space opening up after the break, with United having to chase an equaliser. Their cause was further enhanced when Dillon was sent off for a straight-legged challenge on Emilio Izaguirre. There didn't seem any malicious intent, but it was a dangerous enough tackle to merit the dismissal.

The decision irked McNamara, who was eventually spoken to by the referee Bobby Madden.

A second goal was inevitable, though. Morris repelled two shots with diving tackles, before Forrest eventually steered the ball into the net from 20 yards. The Celtic substitute was less composed minutes later, when he missed from the penalty spot after being bundled over by Paul Dixon.

The miss was particularly chastening, since some of his team-mates had wanted him to let John Guidetti take the penalty. The fans chanted for it to be Brown, but at the end of a difficult week for the Celtic captain, he would have taken most satisfaction from lifting the trophy at the end.

Live text commentary<|endoftext|>In the second of a two-part interview with Günther Spieckermann, the German journalist who recently died aged 91, here he talks about his final years. It was not until he turned 91 that he decided to tell his family that he is dying, as his brother had been doing for several years:

I have no regrets about leaving a public legacy, says Spieckermann

"I don't have regrets about leaving a public legacy. When you leave, you don't get your life back. All of a sudden, you don't know what happened to you for 30 or 40 years, the work you did. Now, after you've left, you find out that your colleagues are all dead. Then you remember yourself, and there's everything, everything that you ever did, that was done in the name of the newspaper, or journalism. There's not a thing that you've ever regretted. There's nothing that you've ever done that you regret. That's something that's hard to understand in life."<|endoftext|>The Obama administration will not enforce existing regulations for offshore drilling, even for the controversial North Dakota oil spill, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced Friday.

Salazar will use a process allowing him to defer enforcing existing regulations, and instead allow the Interior Department to focus efforts on a potential federal lawsuit against oil companies.

The administration's move is a dramatic shift in how environmental regulators will respond to last year's devastating oil spill in the North Dakota town of Mayflower.

ADVERTISEMENT

There has been no estimate of the impact of the spill on the environment and no time frame has been set for the response so far.

A legal settlement between the Obama administration and oil companies must be approved by a judge before the process is completed.

Salazar on Friday told members of the Federalist Society, a conservative-leaning group that includes conservative Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia , he did not know when the court would rule on the oil drilling issue.

Seth Jaffe and Peter Wallsten, both former senior Justice Department officials under President Obama, published an article Thursday on the Huffington Post that said the settlement should be "immediately approved by a federal judge to restore basic financial stability."

The U.S. has no laws regulating how oil companies drill for oil in federal waters. On Thursday, President Obama reiterated his opposition to offshore drilling.

"For the past four years, I've made clear I was opposed to offshore drilling," Obama wrote in a statement. "That's been my position."

In an interview Thursday, Obama said he believed that the decision to allow drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic Ocean did not meet the standards of his environmental legacy.

"The idea that in four years we can take our foot off the gas and say, 'We're okay with this level of pollution' — I just don't think that's a responsible course for us to be on — to me, that's not where we've got to be," Obama said in an interview with the Marshall Project and other reporters.

"I just wouldn't accept that, just so you guys know," the president added.

"I think my legacy would have ended by the time this administration was finished. And I would have thought that my legacy on climate change could have begun much earlier."

It is unclear whether the administration would move forward with a lawsuit against the companies responsible for the Mayflower oil spill.

 emulate his hero Sir Matt Busby and win his second domestic title. There were echoes of Busby's career-best achievement at Glasgow City when the former United midfielder was applauded off in triumph.

United had another outstanding performance but were unable to find the elusive third-quarter winner for the second successive season.

It was United's first title for 19 years and a further blow for Celtic after they were beaten at the 2014 European Championship final in Portugal.

United had scored in each half but could not find the final pass before half-time

United did not really have to wait long for their equaliser, as they were rewarded with the goal they deserved.

Nedum Onuoha gave Brown the chance to win the game with a magnificent low shot, but he pulled the ball back for Michael Keane to finish.

The United goal was reward for a terrific first half which saw United on top.

The best goal of the game came when Darren Fletcher took advantage of a slip at a free-kick to burst clear before firing in an emphatic shot from 20 yards.

The visitors also had chances but their confidence seemed to evaporate when their midfield was caught in possession. It was costly as McEvoy found himself with the ball just outside the box, and he was denied by a fine save from McNamara.

Celtic were not finished yet, though, and they created a stunning one-two for Dillon before the break.

Morris's corner on the right had been cleared, but the ball was allowed to drop to McEvoy, who turned in from four yards.

There was no way back for United with 10 minutes to go, for a succession of dangerous United shots were blocked by Celtic players with the home fans becoming more desperate by the hour.

The only real chance to seal victory came in added time. Morrison raced onto a free-kick on the right and unleashed a rising shot that McNamara parried away.

It mattered little, however, as Celtic wrapped up the title with three matches still to play, leaving United needing to win their last two matches if they are to hold on to their title.

There were some happy faces at Celtic Park on Monday, with some of their players reunited with their fans.

"Reports indicate that tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims are living in a state of near-permanent displacement in Myanmar," it said in a report released by the office of the assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific.


"The situation of the Rohingya in Myanmar is, to put it crudely, appalling," it said. "Hundreds of thousands have taken refuge in Bangladesh and have become internally displaced within Bangladesh. They urgently need protection. They also face serious threats to their lives and security."

Celtic could rely on more space opening up after the break, with United having to chase an equaliser. Their cause was further enhanced when Dillon was sent off for a straight-legged challenge on Emilio Izaguirre. There didn't seem any malicious intent, but it was a dangerous enough tackle to merit the dismissal.

The decision irked McNamara, who was eventually spoken to by the referee Bobby Madden.

A second goal was inevitable, though. Morris repelled two shots with diving tackles, before Forrest eventually steered the ball into the net from 20 yards. The Celtic substitute was less composed minutes later, when he missed from the penalty spot after being bundled over by Paul Dixon.

The miss was particularly chastening, since some of his team-mates had wanted him to let John Guidetti take the penalty. The fans chanted for it to be Brown, but at the end of a difficult week for the Celtic captain, he would have taken most satisfaction from lifting the trophy at the end.

And with his team leading the Scottish Premiership and with a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay with Dundee United to come, Brown will hope to

 have a more satisfying season.

The visitors had never been so sure of their place in the final. The result meant they finished the regular season with a 14-point lead in the table.

But Aberdeen have a chance to equalise on Monday at Pittodrie. Having been hammered 10-0 in the final of the Scottish Cup in October, they must be concerned about the effect losing four in a row has had on their team spirit.

The hosts were particularly wasteful on the break in the first half as Celtic took control.

After having several excellent chances, the Bairns began to dominate possession with their front men. But they were unable to create clear openings, and the final third continued to be as devoid of quality as it had been from both sides.

Scott Brown was Celtic's hero in the final stages

The match was played at Wembley - a first for a Scottish cup final between the sides and for the third time in the Scottish Premiership.

Celtic and their fans made an outstanding trip to the UK for this occasion. Even the crowds that had gathered in East Kilbride and Edinburgh were largely from Scotland, and it was heartening to see them in the crowd.

Despite the heavy defeat in Glasgow, there was a spirit of optimism in the away fans in the aftermath of last week's drubbing in the Scottish Cup semi-final with Hamilton.

Having beaten Aberdeen in the last eight, the club was more than happy to be awarded a home tie. Celtic had a couple of players who played at Pittodrie - Lee Wallace and Lee Stewart - among the players who arrived in Glasgow in a group that also featured Hearts and Rangers.

As usual, Celtic were able to maintain full strength in Scotland, and it gave them a presence in midfield that they will have admired. Gary Mackay-Steven looked the first to react after the final whistle and will hope to regain his place.

The visitors did not have many complaints about the conditions. The Celtic fans, who had been kept penned in for a fourth successive night, were more vocal than usual and seemed happy enough with the atmosphere on the Kop.<|endoftext|>With a year of work behind us, it would be easy to start writing articles and books about how to beat the game of Starcraft.

I believe every single Terran player on the planet would have tried their hardest to break this game down to pieces. But there are simply too damn many different ways these guys, and their strategies, can be executed and the meta-game shifts are too fast to keep track of.

I will be going over one thing every night here: I'll cover one of my (mostly) overlooked, but very important, strategies, that many a player can be able to utilize in the future to win a big event. If you feel like you're not good enough to do the thing I'm going to cover or find it more useful than my article and are stuck in bronze, let me know. I can probably help you get up to the very top of the ladder again, and I can provide any additional feedback or help that you might need.

How to Overcharge and Overcharge for an Expand

It can be pretty difficult to find time to play with a solid playstyle. We often have a large amount of Starcraft to play and it can sometimes get to the point where we feel like we can't squeeze any time in for improvement. I think we tend to start cutting corners in some way, shape, or form whenever we have this amount of Starcraft we can play and the lack

With six wins in his last eight games, United's run of six consecutive league defeats is the least impressive of their league campaign so far, and McNamara knows it.

OTTAWA -- The Senate will begin voting March 22 on a motion that would prevent any government from making any changes to the Senate by making the top two chambers of Parliament the same.

There has been no motion introduced to date on the matter by Conservative Senator Jean-Guy Dagenais.

The motion does not set specific criteria for how the Senate should be reformed, but does say that no member of Parliament should be elected to the upper house if the House of Commons would elect a majority of its seats. Instead, it would set out to create a so-called "balance of power" chamber that would have 10 MPs, rather than the current nine.

The Senate is now one house where a Liberal-appointed Senator chairs it. While the Liberals also control the House of Commons, the Senate continues to be viewed as a less than favourable chamber for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as Parliament has been rocked by a series of scandals, with one recently forcing the Prime Minister to resign his seat in the upper house.

The Liberals have not committed to reform the Senate, but last month said they would consider Senate voting reforms once a new leader was chosen, but nothing has been revealed about when that would be. The government has maintained that any new leaders must be seen to be "non partisan." While the Liberals hope to hold a leadership convention after the next election, no date has been set.

"We want it to go through the Senate process, we want to have the debate on the merits of it, but that's up to the government," said Conservative Senator Linda Frum.

Frum also questioned whether the motion will have any effect on the governing Conservatives, who are currently embroiled in a separate scandal.

"I don't think the Senate has jurisdiction to be a thorn that's in the side, in our side, of any other parliamentarians or government members, and I hope we wouldn't see that happen in our favour," she said.<|endoftext|>The Obama administration's effort to use the threat of terrorism to restrict access to firearms is coming under new scrutiny after a man in Louisiana who was trying to buy a handgun got a visit from law enforcement officers on Saturday.

Louisiana gun shop owner Mike Denny says the shop was the only one allowed to sell firearms, but that a gun-registration check didn't get through because he couldn't produce a handgun registration certificate.

"The police came up and said 'Your sales permit doesn't count because you don't have a registered handgun,'" Denny told The Huffington Post.

The National Rifle Association is claiming the incident proves that the administration has the authority to ban sales of firearms to anyone trying to obtain them, whether or not they passed a gun-sale background check.

"That proves it, I don't know why they're not using this authority," said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. "There are some very poor people having their fingers burned for wanting to buy a pistol and this is one of the examples of why you don't have to be a criminal to own firearms."

Denny said he couldn't confirm whether investigators were aware of the store's possession of a handgun permit, but said it is likely.

THE CONTEST

We're calling the writing contest Redivider '17, which stands for Redivider '17 Literary Competition. Please enter with Redivider and email us your entry to contest.redivider [at] gmail.com.

For writers of fiction, we're looking for "a novel, novella, short story, or other creative nonfiction work" (Redivider's emphasis). We don't like flash fiction or nonfiction with no plot. You don't have to be published, but if you are, you must follow these guidelines for entry:

You must be at least 15 years old to enter.

You must live in the United States and Canada.

You must be registered with the American Booksellers Association as a member. (Don't believe us? Click here.)

A few final terms and conditions: We want original works (not just reprints or excerpts), and you have to make the final chapter your own.

We think it's important that we give you the opportunity to submit a work that has wide appeal. The first 250 people who submit to R17 will be chosen at random.

This contest opens at Midnight on January 14, 2017 and closes at midnight on March 16, 2017. If you don't hear from us within 4 weeks, send us an email and we'll set things up.

The agency has no intention of releasing such information, but it's not a big secret, according to documents obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

The leaked NSA files, which date from before 2011, suggest that government employees have been using Bitcoin-mining software since at least 2008, when documents show a document on "Bitcoin in Action" was produced. That document describes that a mining rig "generates and sends payments to users when validating blocks." By that same account, the documents say, computers are "mining to generate addresses to send Bitcoins to."


Some of the documents from that email dump appear to confirm that the NSA has software to track Bitcoin mining data, according to Ars Technica. A May 2008 email from NSA employee Mike Mearls says: "We have a project with NSA to use blockchain.info to keep track of mining activity."

The NSA is not the only group that has access to such Bitcoin mining data. In April, the British House of Commons

HACK YOUR SCHOOL

We love stories about how students and faculty make the best of a bad situation, but we also love stories about how teachers and students take advantage of a perfectly healthy situation for their own benefit. We're thrilled to be able to do both with Hack Your School. To apply, submit a 250-word entry (no more than 1,000 words), with a strong focus on the student-faculty dynamics at your school in an open-ended narrative or blog post. Your submission must be received through the RIT Submissions website by 2 March 2017. All materials must be submitted in plain text in the Subject Line in a Word file (.doc or .docx). Please include at least a short bio on the first page of each item. To learn more, including some examples of stories we've won in the past, read on. For additional guidelines, visit the Rules For Winners page and check the Blog Winners and Winners Archives.

We're thrilled to announce that the 2016 winners of the Hack Your School contest were announced today. In this year's contest, we asked for students, teacher, and parent submissions to help us identify the top ten stories on campus that feature students and faculty at RIT in unexpected ways. Check them out!

Congratulations to the winners of the 2016 Hack Your School contest, which included stories for the 2016-2017 school year! As you can see from their descriptions below, many of the entries were inspired by current events; others were created in response to real-world situations within the context of an RIT education. It's important to note that this wasn't a category that we were asked to narrow down too much, and the stories may vary considerably. In fact, two of the winners are only just starting their careers and another two came from students who were in their early grades and were just given the chance to write about what it's like to be in that place on campus. So while this award is for creativity and imagination… a story's content matters too.

Here are our winners!

"The Secret Lab," by Nisha Rajpal

"The Secret Lab" is set in a top secret location on campus, and features four roommates learning about physics and physics technology. Nisha Rajpal, an RIT graduate student majoring in Physics, wrote the story that follows three of the four roommates at the same time, from a first-person perspective that is so engaging that some of the audience members are totally convinced the story is real. We couldn't be happier with the final product as we know that readers will become hooked in no time, and we can't wait to see where the story takes them as they move on and meet new students in the meantime.

"Love" by Taryn Eichhorn

ABOUT THE COMPETITION

This year's contest is called the Big Picture: Fiction Contest. In the past, we have held contests with a more literary focus: the Science Fiction Fiction Contest, Horror Fiction Contest, and Science/Sci/Tech Writing Contest. We will be following this tradition as well by focusing on fiction as our chosen genre. One of the great things about the web form and our competition format is the scope for our writers to expand their scope of stories. As the competition moves forward, we will be announcing more contest-specific categories.

This contest is open to all writers and is open worldwide. The winner will serve as a mentor for the author of their first published fiction piece who applies to the contest. We will be judging entries from the first year. Only fiction submissions are accepted.

To learn more about the contest and submit for this year's competition, visit their website: https://www.tinyletter.com/bigpicturefiction

THANKYOU

Everyone that entered the last contest, and especially those who participated in past, made it possible for us to continue this tradition for this year's Big Picture: Fiction Contest. The community of writers and readers supported both our competition and the competition itself. This year's Big Picture: Fiction Contest is truly a one-of-a-kind experience.

Violence against the person 208, of which 38 caused serious injuries and 1 was fatal

Sexual offences 2, 1 of which was rape

A significant number of the attacks are related to gang activity or the theft of vehicles of various types.

ably through the retail and home delivery system

The substances are sometimes used as projectiles and to 'disrupt or frustrate' the actions of the police and of the courts.

There are various reasons some may use these substances:

To create a distraction for a police response – for example pouring bleach into a vehicle windshield and leaving – to cause damage or at the very least cause annoyance to police and potential suspects. [This is often referred to as the 'bottling a riot']

As a form of protest, as often happened during the 2011 riots

At the moment there is absolutely no evidence that crime of this type is linked to the illegal sale of other drugs. It is thought more likely a victim or victim's family will contact their lawyer to ask for compensation for 'psychological damage' or the victim may be unable to face the pain of an injury or to support their family or friends who may suffer

As a form of attack and intimidation – such as throwing acid at a person or vehicle. [This is usually not called an attack but is a nuisance to the victim. It was also common during 2011 riots with people throwing acid and putting it in cars, buildings and public transport.]

In the past there have been reports of gangs using acid against each other.

The UK's Criminal Justice system


The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (CJA) applies to all cases and is particularly important when evidence is being tested in court. It also applies to 'disappearing' evidence like fingerprints and DNA, so police officers face a whole suite of challenges and requirements when dealing with these types of cases.

All evidence (as in all cases) is treated with care by the courts and must be disclosed to the defence and to the defendant where any doubt is apparent to the court. The defence and the police do not have a 'blank cheque' on the reliability of evidence and must examine all the evidence in detail for any possible inconsistencies. This process is known as the 'trials process'. The court will not allow any evidence to be admitted when it is shown there are significant doubts about the truth or reliability of the evidence.

It is for the CPS 'to make its judgment' with regard to whether a suspect has a reasonable basis for suspecting his or her own death.

There is a requirement for the CPS, as always it must act in the interests of justice. However, in criminal trial the CPS have much greater powers to charge, test and charge over other types of evidence and to prosecute an accused person for a greater period (for example, a life sentence).

There is a mandatory requirement for the police to tell the public any case where there is evidence of a specific offence and then when there is sufficient evidence to prosecute for this offence, which is what the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 states.

The crime 'year'

The Crime Crime Agency publishes the Crime in England and Wales 'crime year' – which compares crime in 2012 to the previous year (see here for details). The Crime in England and Wales report also publishes statistics on 'all the crimes' and the statistics for all crime recorded in England and Wales are given as crimes per 100,000 population (in other words the crime rate).

What has happened in the UK so far this year?

Below is a summary of crime rates in the UK so far in 2015:

The Crime in England and Wales report suggests there were just over 1,200,000 crimes (1.24 million crimes) recorded in the UK in 2015:

Crime rate in England and Wales is about half the UK equivalent of Italy (2.3) and Japan (2.9)

able are present in household products.

There may be no requirement to use them and they may be considered to be innocuous.

Some of them have been banned in many countries, for example ammonia and bleach, for obvious reasons.

People with 'clean hands' can dispose of such products safely

Why people use them

The substances may cause minor discomfort or irritation to the skin when consumed, including irritation to the digestive process (which will usually be not noticed by the victim and not be a health issue).

It is a way of making an unpleasant experience 'more tolerable'.

It creates a feeling of being out of control as a result of the corrosIVE substances' effect on the body chemistry

People may feel that they cannot get away with 'normal' or 'good' behaviour

It creates a feeling of 'disorder' and anxiety

It might also be used in 'deliberate sabotage' with the aim of 'breaking' or causing damage

There is evidence for a link between use of corrosive substances and a higher risk of mental health issues. (See links in main article)

Where corrosive substances are used

People are thought to be more likely to use them when at home, even when the room has the highest levels of contamination as they become more likely to believe they have done something to cause the contamination. However, such occurrences are less common when people use the substances at places where there is no contamination.

Reasons there for the spike in use over the past year

London is one of the safest cities in the world, in part because the levels of crime in the capital are well below the levels in similar urban areas, notably Paris, Amsterdam and Berlin.

The increase may in part be due to the large increase in the prevalence of gangs during the last few years: The Metropolitan Police says this is likely to have led to increased activity in the criminal community in London and that gangs are now the largest non-law enforcement group in the capital.

The report says that more often corrosive substances are used by young people, though this is not always the case.<|endoftext|>(CNN) As she sat on the front patio of the home she and her husband owned in Virginia Beach, Virginia, last summer, Susan Taylor's blood pressure went down. Doctors told her she was high enough that she could be taken to the hospital and admitted for a medical evaluation.

"I knew it was not a good sign," Taylor told CNN. "I'd had one doctor tell me I wasn't high enough, and that was a few years before they tested for cocaine. I thought I had to have been smoking or some kind of drug."

In an attempt to help lower her blood pressure, her husband prescribed a prescription painkiller called Dilaudid. But the drug is highly addictive, Taylor said.

When Dilaudid is mixed with acetaminophen, it causes a dangerous interaction that can cause respiratory seizures for the prescriber, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Acetaminophen, also called Tylenol, is found in many over-the-counter pain relievers.

As her pain became worse, Taylor called 911. Her husband, an air traffic controller with the state's Department of Defense, heard the call on his police scanner and was alerted.

But on the way to the emergency department, he was instructed to bring the drug by his truck to avoid an accidental exposure. He told reporters he felt "drugged to the gills."

Taylor says he never heard he had been exposed to the drug, but he was placed in isolation while he awaited evaluation by doctors.

"The doctor told him he was dead on the spot

The corrosive substances are often associated with property crime for which a quick clean and a 'brighter tomorrow', and are frequently used as weapons for street gangs

These substances often cause chemical burns to the eyes, nose and respiratory system

It is estimated that around 70% of corrosive substance related crime has been committed by the gangs and they appear to be in a position to profit from this

How to help

Do not buy products with any kind of warning

Do not store these products away from heat and sunlight as this will cause them to deteriorate

Check the packaging for the substance that contains the words 'harmful if swallowed' in large black letters

Consider whether you live in, work in or visit London and take precautions if in contact with anyone living in or visiting the capital especially a homeless individual

The Metropolitan Police's Operation Rake is taking the issue of corrosive substance related crime seriously and have set up a dedicated team of officers to deal with this issue. Operation Rake is the most extensive and targeted operation undertaken by the Met's dedicated corrosive substance detectives.

If you have information that could help to identify a suspect you can contact the Met via 101. To remain anonymous you can contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org and press 'submit a tip'.

The film is rife with inaccurate statistics, and it is impossible to evaluate its claims without further information. Still, it is interesting to look at the statistics.

First, to clarify, in NOM's film, two men or two women can technically be considered a same-sex "marriage" between a man and a woman — unless, that is, they have two men and a man, but the movie clearly doesn't count their relationship.

When comparing the general population population to couples who are in same-sex relationships, NOM's statistics say that gay men and lesbians tend to have a much higher rate of divorce than straight couples. But the National Survey of Family Growth data, which the film cites, suggests that gay couples are no more likely to divorce than straight couples.

The NOM film claims that, in 2009, the divorce rate for same-sex couples was 14.4 percent, or 2.28 times the rate amongst straight couples, despite statistics suggesting that the rate was actually slightly lower than the national average among all couples in the country.

In a fact sheet accompanying the film, NOM claims that the rate was actually 13.7 percent in 1999, despite the fact that the statistics cited by the US Census show that the divorce rate for US households headed by same-sex couples was actually the same as in 2009.

If we focus on the number of heterosexual "divorces" among the population based on the rate found by NOM (6.4 percent) and compare that to the rate as stated in the Census Bureau (14.4 percent), we find that heterosexual couples are actually half as likely to leave their marriages than those in same-sex couples.

So far, so good for same-sex couples. But is NOM wrong in its assumption that the divorce rate for gay couples is higher than it is for straight couples? Maybe not — but it's worth pointing out.

And with that said, it's important to keep in mind that NOM's claims are not backed up by empirical

 crimes in London where a corrosive substance was used or threatened to be used

2010 293

2011 259

2012 162

2013 210

2014 166

2015 261

2016 458

2017 119 so far this year. [Maybe suggesting a decrease in 2017?]

In the London 'crime year' 2016 to 2017 corrosive substance use in crimes can be broken down further as follows:

Violence against the person 208, of which 38 caused serious injuries and 1 was fatal

Robbery 118, 10 of which caused serious injury to the victim

Sexual offences 2, 1 of which was rape

A significant number of the attacks are related to gang activity or the theft of vehicles of various types.

It is worth pointing out that although the increase in use of corrosive substances is concerning the numbers are very tiny indeed when compared with crime in general

Reasons why corrosive substances are being used

The various substances, including drain cleaner, oven cleaner, ammonia and bleach are cheap and easy to purchase

There is no onus on the retailer to restrict or question the sale of these substances

They can be carried easily and for the most part 'legally' and almost undetect

able

It would seem difficult to challenge the sales in certain circumstances, as it is unlikely that the retailer would be called before a court.

The sale of these substances could mean that those who buy are in most cases not aware that they are purchasing the substance, and it is not necessarily for an illegal purpose.

They can also be used with a view to the person having a sexual benefit, which of course is illegal.

The use of corrosive substances must come under the jurisdiction of Health and Safety at Work regulations.

In particular, the requirement that a substance is not dangerous for the health of others (such as the health of people in the home) is a factor in determining if it is used to impair or to make dangerous a person's health.

Other considerations include that a substance is not used as revenge (as it has a limited duration, and is only a short-term effect) and that it is not used to cause serious injury to a person.

Where do the statistics come from?

The information provided was collected using the Home Office's national crime recording systems 'C-Crime' and 'Crime Survey for England and Wales'. These two databases are compiled from information recorded by police forces (and, in the case of crimes against the person are recorded by the CPS).

The annual figures are published yearly in 'Crime in England and Wales' and 'Crime in England and Wales - Table 1' and in 'Publications - Crime in England and Wales - Table 2'.

The data has been collated over the years, starting with the 2001/02 data and now going through to the latest available, 2016.

The Home Office has stated that it is difficult to use the data to define levels of change or trends because a large proportion of crime is not registered. The figures indicate rates rather than absolute levels. However there is a level at which someone falls under the 'statutory definition of crime'.

More detailed information is provided in the 'Crime Statistics for England and Wales' publication. The detailed data for 2012/13 has been released on the website of the Parliamentary Research Service.

How does the Home Office compare with the previous years?

The Home Office reported crime statistics based on the data collated from police forces from July 1998 to March 2015. This was to remove the impact of changes in recording practices.

This year's data from the Home Office shows that:

there were 7.3 million recorded crimes in the last year compared with 7.2 million in 2010/11

crime has been falling steadily since 2007/08, and dropped from the low recorded level in 2007/08 of 7.3 million

the number of recorded crime incidents reported to the Police has fallen by 20% in the last two years (from 4.08 million incidents in 2010/11 to 3.65 million in 2012/13)

this year's reported crime data does not show changes in the proportion of crime 'reported to the police'. Data is not yet available to show the proportion of crime 'which was dealt with by police'

In the latest crime statistics there were 17,400 more victim contacts and 1.3 million more victims assisted in the latest year than in the previous year, whilst the total number of incidents rose by 2% (from 3.9 million in 2012/13 to 3.91 million in 2013/14).

In terms of levels of severity - the level of offences which requires a police investigation - the number reported fell by 2% in the latest year - from 2.09 million in 2012/13 to 2.00 million in 2013/14.

As an introvert, one of the difficulties I have in living out that part of myself is a fear of commitment. It can manifest itself as a fear of committing; of putting myself out there and opening up to opportunities or socializing in a way I feel I don't need to, or if I feel uncomfortable enough when talking to people, that I would rather run away from them than to be uncomfortable. To put myself out there, to make a change, to commit to this or that. I don't want to be afraid of commitment, because if I were, I wouldn't do it.

But what I'm afraid of isn't that I don't do this or that or the other thing that I sometimes want to do. I'm afraid of committing to something that I'm not yet sure if I need to do with that person. I think of this not as a fear of being obligated, but more like a fear of being unable to let go. If I could make a decision that I didn't feel entirely sure I needed to do, I'd be free to do much more than I need to, and I'd be free to let go of that one thing before it spiralled into something bad.

This is why, as an introvert, the things that I have the least control over are the things I choose and the commitments I make. If I want to get in touch with my emotions while meeting somebody, I can't decide or choose where to put myself. I either do it alone and let the other person do whatever they need doing with their emotions or I go through a series of awkward actions together, before finally we say, I'm doing this together. It's the same to me with a choice: either say yes to something, or I wait and hope that if I do it, it will bring me the things I need.

I guess in the end, I'm afraid that saying yes will bring me that thing I want even though it isn't as important to me as it once

In a resolution passed unanimously by its members last month, the organization said America has struggled with race relations and racial disparities for decades and must continue to work toward "comprehensive solutions."


[The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]

"Many black Americans have felt that the government is not responding as well as it should to their needs and is not addressing their needs, particularly in the areas of education, criminal justice, housing, job training, child support, health care and access to quality health care," the group said.

The resolution praised President Obama and federal officials' efforts in Ferguson, but cautioned against assuming he was the right person to fix the problem: "[W]e must consider our elected officials' political affiliations and be cognizant that we cannot assume anything we have seen so far in Ferguson is an indication of what will happen over time."

The NAACP has taken in millions of dollars in federal stimulus funds to help fight economic inequality and racial disparities.

After an hour and a half of highly charged attacks on the EU and the UK, Mr Johnson delivered a clear message of support – not dissent – for Theresa May's hard Brexit strategy, which is to use a so-called "divorce bill" to pay the EU for the money being sent to Brussels after Brexit.

On a day when the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, claimed to have "a few tricks up his sleeve", Mr Johnson took the opposite view.

A three-part, dual-pane door is a door that is attached to two frames to fit into the gap between the wall and the door, which allows you to build taller and wider. In most cases, the two parts of the dual pane doors will share an interior space, but in some instances, they may share external spaces.

Why choose a 3-Pane Door?

A three- pane door is often preferred because of its ability to support additional space for storage, display, and the like. Also, as a result of the additional doors, a three-pane door doesn't have the same aesthetic as a two-panel door. Additionally, there is a noticeable increase in the stability and strength of the door when the three-panel door is used.

If you're considering using an air-tight door, which doesn't have a removable door, you won't need to add much height or width for more storage space, but the added stability may be worth it to some. Also, some architects prefer a 3-pane door, as it allows for more open space, which may make a space feel brighter, more organized, and more inviting.

Why are there two levels of packaging and who decides what level it is?

There are two levels of packaging: the outer packaging and the inner packaging. These two levels are applied to each of our products to ensure that your favourite shade of Bobbi Brown is preserved and safe to use. Outer packaging

The outer packaging is the outer fabric and cardboard. We will not provide any shrinkage of the outer packaging. This package can be folded and sealed for ease in transport and on the web site or retail store. Your package should not have any cracks or cracks that create a potential risk or injury to your items. The outer packaging should be strong enough to withstand the weight of any items that you have stored in it. Inner packaging

The inner packaging has the ingredients in the product in small, individually boxed, opaque boxes, all printed on the inside with a layer of the product on top. Each product will have a printed label on the inner packaging, which you will place onto the cardboard and the fabric cover of the outer packaging. The inner packaging should be strong enough to withstand the weight of any products that you have in it. We do not provide any shrinkage on the inner packaging that may allow any cracks to appear during shipment.

HOPE

Ending my series of travels around Fukushima, I return to Tomioka to see the thing for which the city is most famous and its residents most proud – one of the longest and oldest cherry blossom tunnels in Japan. For the residents of Tomioka, cherry trees have always been something more than just a well-known tourist attraction or the historic symbol of the town. Not only did they admire the aesthetic attributes of the flowers, but they were also part of their lives, organised festivals, meetings and the topic of family conversations.

The natural beauty and powerful symbolism as well as their constant presence in Japanese arts have made cherry trees become an icon of Japanese cultural identity.

In the spiritual sense, they remind us of how beautiful, yet tragically short and fragile, life is – just like the blooming

 leaves that symbolise the cherry blossoms.

The existence of these tunnels (called "Miyako tunnels" in Japanese) is quite unexpected to us, but as Tomioka is very close to the ocean, cherry trees grew right there and, over thousands of years, naturally produced these underground passages. One can almost imagine that trees used to come down from the trees and then the water from the river and the trees and water merged and grew under the road in front of the house. The Miyako tunnels are an ideal example of a naturally formed natural phenomenon that could be produced by plants with an extreme length of life. They are a good example of the natural evolution of life and how many of them are generated even in the face of extreme geological conditions.

In this photo, a cherry blossom tree has grown out of the road and has reached its tip, about 20 centimetres, to the house of Tomioka's resident, Mrs. Takao Inoue. These tunnels are one of the longest as far as the Japanese are concerned. The "Miyako tunnels" are just a bit less than 200 metres long and one can easily imagine that more and more trees are growing there and eventually the whole area will look completely different in about two years.

Mizuho, Fukuoka

This is the place where the main cherry blossoms of the year fall to the water during the first day of the autumn – on August 3rd. The town of Mizuho is in Fukuoka prefecture, which lies on the west coast of Japan. It is an industrial city located in the middle of four districts, which are the home of Fujiyoshida, Sannomiya, Utsunomiya and Yashikura. This particular town is close to Nagasaki and the other big cities in the region.

Since Mizuho was settled in 1794, the area around this cherry blossom site has been an important source of income for these four cities. They made special arrangements when cherry blossoms reached their peak and set up a market for the visitors to buy various items for cherry blossom crafts. The most famous of these crafts have been painted houses and wooden toys. After they had reached their peak, the cherry blossom trees started to deteriorate. One of the first things that happened was that the cherry blossom trees began to decay and died. Since they were planted at such a long time ago, these trees were able to grow in very fertile soil and they could not be helped with the conditions of Fukushima as Fukushima is very different from the surrounding areas. Mizuho's trees also fell victim to the flooding and the subsequent nuclear fallout. Many of them were destroyed. The people of Mizuho have not forgotten about what happened in Fukushima and its aftermath. Today, many towns and villages have a shrine dedicated to those lost in nuclear catastrophe, such as those of Iwaki, Aomori and Fudarishi. Many other cities have such a shrine too.

Mizuho has a unique town motto, which means : "Mizuho is not just Miyako". In this place, that is not just cherry blossoms, but rather, it is an entire town. This city has many interesting sites, but cherry blossoms are its one of the main draws. Although the cherry blossoms will only last for about 6 weeks, the cherry tree still remains in the town for about 100 years! It is a city where people gather to commemorate the cherry blossom and enjoy the cherry blossom festival.

There are many places around Fumoto that are just as interesting as the cherry blossoms. These sites can all be found in Futaba and on the eastern coast

 flowers that they are.

A visit to the Honten Cherry Blossom Tunnel is often a special occasion in Tomioka. After the completion of the tunnel in 1997, some 15 billion boku were planted in the tunnel and a special memorial hall was built to commemorate their natural history. Some of these trees will continue to grow in the tunnel for another 500 years – and the flower beds that they contain will be maintained as natural areas for all to enjoy.

The Honten Cherry Blossom Tunnel was first opened in March 1987. It connects Tomioka with the city of Okuma. Here the train runs under an old tree, a small part of which was removed for use as a tunnel guide.

In the following picture you can see that the tree which led the train right through the tunnel was later cut down by the local authorities to make way for more modern structures. The train that leads through the tunnels still takes people through the Honten Cherry Blossom Tunnel today, even though the old part of it has been sealed off. It is possible to make a walk into the Honten tunnel from Tomioka station.

At a distance of about 10 metres, you can see it is possible to walk under the railway tracks to the left of the tunnel path. If a person were standing on this spot, they would be able to see a little of the tunnel itself, as well as a couple of trees growing right next to it. There is a small tunnel guide at the end of the track for people to use if they find it difficult to get through. If you stand on the right of the tunnel in this picture, you can make your way along the left track.

I have a personal favourite photograph of the Honten Tunnel I took at the end of the day. I was walking along the right track near the entrance to the tunnel, when I spotted a couple young adults who were looking at the view over the track. I followed them and found that each had a young child in tow. I was curious to see the two women in action and I was very pleased to notice that they had a really good camera in their hands as well, so I stopped my walk and stood to capture a photo. Although they were a bit embarrassed by the fact that I had followed them into the Honten tunnel, the moment was well worth capturing and I was quite happy to see them looking back over the track as I turned away.

I was able to get close to the tunnel, but I was unable to take any photographs without some kind of barrier. To have an idea how this happened, I made no attempt to get to the other side of the road. I waited until I reached the far side of the road, about 200 meters away from the entrance to the tunnel. I decided to set my camera on a rock a little ways up from the road and waited. Soon I heard a very faint, small thumping sound as the barrier was sliding forward. When it was completely open, I was able to get photographs, even in very poor light. The thumping sound was extremely low-frequency and it was hard to make out. It was too quiet to distinguish it as a sound and I could not see any sign that it was anything more than a wooden or stone block.

The barrier at the end of the Honten tunnel is made of concrete blocks. The main section is about 50 meters around and can easily be passed under. The tunnel guide, which can easily be seen in this photo, leads through the tunnel under the bridge. This guide is used by people who don't know the route. It is attached to a pole at the end of the tunnel and is connected to the main section of the guide wire by ropes. If another person

The only difference is that there weren't many cherry trees here in the town centre prior to and during the nuclear disaster.

This is what Tomioka looks like today.

When the nuclear accident happened, a huge majority of the town centre was completely destroyed. However due to the fact that there were still a lot of trees in the town centre, most of them were able to survive the meltdown.

These days the town only gets a small percentage of its trees, most of which have died, but still the town centre remains green and the cherry blossom tunnels are still intact. There are also still cherry trees growing in other parts of Fukushima town. The two largest trees are at Tokai Park, which is located a kilometre away from the Fukushima Daiichi plant, and are still covered with leaves.

There are still plenty of trees here in Tomioka.

The tunnels are still here, even though there haven't been flowers for years.

The large Japanese cherry trees in the middle of the tunnel are still alive.

Many of the cherry trees in Tomioka are still alive.

Unfortunately the town is still struggling to rebuild.

The huge tunnel connecting Tomioka Town with the forest has collapsed.

It looks like the big tree in the upper right has fallen.

In the upper right corner this tree still looks as healthy as ever.

There are still plenty of living trees in Tomioka.

 white leaves. In this, they have a special symbolism and significance. In a Buddhist scripture, they have been described as the Buddha, the tree of life or the world tree in Japanese religions. In popular culture, however, they are often associated to happiness and joy, to happiness after suffering, to love and to romance.

In this way, the blooming blooming blooming blossoming blossoming trees of Tomioka symbolise the springtime revival and are always surrounded by happiness, hope and happiness. They are a source of inspiration or the hope for a brighter future. The idea of cherry blossom trees as the hope tree to brighten one's life and help revive the spirits in the face of difficult times is as old as Buddhism itself. For example, in Buddhist literature, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara, who has attained "the highest bliss and joy", is described as the "spring-like hope tree" who encourages others to achieve enlightenment. He is often seen standing in front of the blooming trees, looking for someone to help him by spreading the "sway of hope".

THE TUBE

The most famous cherry blossom tunnel in Tomioka is a tube made of natural stone called Namie-no-o-mikami in Japanese. Originally it was a spring-like tunnel about 80 cm in diameter, about 30 metres deep and 3 metres high, built in the late 19th century. It was intended for a Japanese soldier in his later years, who would climb up and down the stairs on special stages and look to his family in the tunnel and wish them good health and the opportunity to see cherry blossoms in the spring. There was a stage at the bottom where he could look at the flowers and wish his family health and happiness. He was told that the cherry blossom trees would bloom each year, so he just wanted to see it. At the time, a little girl who lived in the town was fond of that stage and was often seen in front of it reading newspapers.

It was soon converted into a tourist attraction when the owner of Namie-no-o-mikami died and another Japanese was interested in building a garden and cherry blossom tunnel at the top of the building. He had a plan of the tunnels and built them, but the tunnel was too narrow for him and in the end he lost interest. Then a Japanese architect arrived at the town and he proposed building a small garden there. Since it was in the middle of the Japanese city it would make a great attraction. It was his idea of Namie-no-o-mikami and soon the town built a little garden that looked very similar to that of the Namie-no-o-mikami. A little girl was playing in the garden with her friends, looking at the cherry blossoms in the window in the roof, when the garden was opened to the public.

The garden and tunnel were so popular that the second tunnel – Namie-no-o-mikami-no-mura – opened on 19 June 1927. As a result, the first garden was left empty. In order to fill this garden, a new tunnel had to be built. The owner of the tunnel wanted the garden to stay empty and even the children were kept out of its shadow so that no one could take pictures of it. A number of Japanese and Japanese-American children came to the garden and took pictures. Unfortunately, they left nothing to remember Tomioka as a paradise. The garden was filled with a large amount of weeds and trees that were overgrown. They left much of the beautiful garden covered with weeds, and much of the beautiful blossoming blossom trees were missing. They left the

Dolerite's Threats to Shale Gas

Dolerite's threats to successful shale gas extraction are neatly expressed in four facts:

Falcon Oil & Gas were ahead of Shell to get a shale gas exploration concession in the Karoo. They could take their pick of spots. They chose about 30 000 square kilometres in the only part of the Karoo without dolerite.

In June 2013, the US Energy Information Administration downgraded South Africa's potential shale gas reserves from 485 trillion cubic feet (which put us fifth in the world) to 390 tcf (eighth in the world), in part because of "geologic complexity caused by igneous intrusions".

 CEO Trevor Hoole told the conference in Durban to "mind the grommet" (a dangerous, watery geologic feature that can obstruct the natural flow of water across a region so dolerite-intruded shale fields are often associated with them).

But it is not just Falcon that thinks the future of South African shale gas will depend on fixing the dolerite issue. In November 2013, PRA said:

The country has not fully exploited its remaining underground resources, with a shortage of groundwater resources causing concern. There is also concern over the environmental impacts of the gas sector, including the environmental impacts of dolerite-intruded formations … [R]ather than to leave unexploited resources undiscovered and undrinkable, and to allow these to be mined or flared, we recommend that the Government adopt a 'zero' approach to oil and gas in its energy mix and pursue exploration and production from its remaining resource bases.

In essence, fracking for gas needs fixing its dolerite issue.

The Future of Natural Gas Development

Dolerite is in fact not a fatal blow to shale development, according to a report by the South African Petroleum Investment Management Company (PIMCO) and the University of the Western Cape. It states the industry has sufficient drilling depth and the economics of shale gas make it economically feasible. They further state that if the South African government and industry work together, a natural gas boom could grow.

However, natural gas resources are still highly competitive.

The report says that there has been high level of investment in the industry in South Africa as the government has recognised the importance of a reliable and affordable source of natural gas as part of its energy mix. This is evidenced by the fact that new gas power plants were constructed between 2007 and 2011 at a cost of approximately R10 billion. It adds that this is a considerable amount when considering other sources.

"We have been assured by the Department of Energy and Water and others that the sector is moving into a more sustainable future where the Government will not allow shale gas developments to proceed at any cost, as the impact of their impact on people, landscape and environment would be too severe." PIMCO & UWC report, April 2014

How to tackle Dolerite

The solution to solving the dolerite issue is relatively simple.

Firstly, drill a new well no deeper than 500 meters below sea level. This can only be done given the need for additional drilling as a replacement to existing wells.

Secondly, drill additional shallow wells to be operated using fracking technology to bring the surface down to 500 meters. This should solve the problem. With such a new well, the water levels in the river will return more to the ground level and the water level in the land below will improve greatly. This will improve the overall quality of life in the surrounding land, as it will ensure land health is optimised. In fact, the Drieda Water Treatment Plant is already operating in the area using wastewater from the Drieda Water Treatment Plant, which will be increased.

The Drieda Water Treatment Plant has been operating in the district since 1985 but it is now at capacity. The South African government is currently reviewing the plant's future and, despite the current drought in the province, is reviewing the plant's water quality.

Finally, all of these developments require approval from the Environment Department which is not as difficult as it seems.

If a plan is implemented for a new well, the cost of a new well will be about R5 billion per well, with the cost to construct new facilities costing an additional R5 billion.

However, this is a relatively small issue compared to the billions being spent

 CEO Pravin Gordhan acknowledged that dolerite was a "major concern", but admitted that it is possible to deal with dolerite in the long term. "The challenge is to reduce the threat of the dolerite intrusion," he said.

The SA Bureau of Mineral Resources and Energy (BMRE) acknowledged that dolerite could be a challenge but said: "Although there are no proven cases of groundwater contamination due to dolerite-intrusive shale operations, the risk of groundwater contamination due to dolerite-intrusive operations cannot be ruled out."

But even if dolerite was not a major concern, it would have to be overcome before exploration and production could go ahead. A new report for the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) warns that dolerite could be devastating for the entire South African food chain.

Dervin Mpofu, a South Africa-based plant physiologist and PhD student at the University of Pretoria (UPS) who led the study, says that when the dolerite intrusion first occurs it forms a "vortex-like" pattern, which means it traps water within itself. This means dolerite can get a hold on water and stop the water from passing through it. It can trap up to five times the amount of water as normal ground water.

The research team found that dolerite would prevent a full complement of plant life from growing in a riverine ecosystem, limiting the availability of plant foods. They also found that it would prevent plant growth at different points in time. In one section of the river, the water is so saturated that the grass grows at a point a lot further upstream than it does at its usual height. "Even if dolerite can be managed, this water may be used up in a short period leading to a dramatic drop in the plant productivity," says Mpofu. This could be detrimental to farmers because a lower plant productivity is usually linked with higher pesticide and herbicide use, which could be more harmful to farmers than dolerite.

When the water levels in a river are lower than normal, the area flooded may act like a sponge, soaking up rain water and then holding onto it for periods in the future. But when the water becomes more saturated then it is like a bottle with only the top half filled up. This is like being unable to drink from the bottle because there is no air in the bottle. "This means the water will hold onto water from a water source that is less full or not at its optimal level. So we can now see how this will limit productivity," says Mpofu.

The SA Institute of Water Law has calculated the water loss for each cubic metre per year for a 1,000-hectare surface area. It found that a dolerite intrusion of 50 litres per metre in diameter means a loss of one cubic metre of water per year. With a current surface area of 7 million hectares, this means that about 40 percent of land would need to be protected for a water supply system to maintain its quality.

In a water law paper, Mpofu found that "dolerite-intrusion-induced water loss can lead to significant reductions in regional groundwater tables, affecting aquifers over very large spatial scales," which could affect the water supply system across a large area. This kind of water loss may also impact freshwater ecosystems, which are key areas for agricultural production. When groundwater is depleted and there is less freshwater in the aquatic environment, it may not have the opportunity to build up, such as in the case of South Africa's lake trout.

 of Angola's head of geological research and resource management, Mr. Mfonenga Ria, testified at a World Economic Forum event about the challenges facing dolerite wells. He estimated that dolerite wells on the Karoo costs SA as much as 1.30 billion dollars per well.

Even before Ria's testimony, the International Geological Congress reported that, despite the lack of "scientific certainty" about dolerite's impact on the Karoo, it does seem to have been implicated in a number of recent groundwater contamination and well failure incidents.

Ria also noted two other important trends in the Karoo:

"On some wells, gas can be produced with a lower pressure and a lower pressure differential, but with the exception of one well (on Mount Ede), there is no method for producing gas with two different, but equal pressures. One method, developed by Falcon Oil & Gas, is to pump a fluid of two different densities of water. Another method developed by PAML [South Africa Petroleum Development] is by using a gravity system, which will deliver the liquid in two different volumes. But the pressure differential is not the same. For more than 50 years, we've seen various water injections with different pressure to improve flow rates at surface, but not at depths that are more than a couple metres."


"But if the pressure differential is too large (meaning that too much gas is produced), you cannot recover the water. This is a very important phenomenon because, like many fluids, the better the performance and the deeper the volume injected, the more expensive it is."

But the most alarming fact for the environment and the industry is that dolerite wells do not necessarily leak water. One can easily make assumptions about dolerite leaks based on geology. Yet, as Ria noted, "we don't know what's the actual volume" and "we don't know if it really leaks out."

Ria went on, "In most of the cases in the Karoo, it was assumed that the wells that did leak released water. But in some situations, the groundwater came out of the well more like an oily surface (seafood). It was almost impossible to clean those wells" and the quality of the water "was also a problem, which had to be cleaned by borehole drills. In our experiences, these types of problems have increased since the introduction of dolerite."

For Shell South Africa, an alternative gas-producing system is clearly required. Shell believes that the prospect of large volumes of gas in the Karoo should be met by the "low-risk" low-tech LNG (light-tight-rock liquefied natural gas) system. However, it will be a long and difficult journey to convince the government and the people of the Karoo that such a project would be worth building, given its uncertain economics and unknown and potentially adverse impacts to the environment. In South Africa, this is an area where trust is lacking.

Shell's Plan to "Go Green" with Clean Tech

When South African voters turn the ballotboxes next October, they may be confronted with two new options as they head to the voting booth:

Shell's proposed "LNG for everyone" programme.

Shell's plan to "Go green" with clean energy and a more sustainable business model.

"The LNG for everyone" programme is based on the idea that the economic impact of the shale gas exploration on the people of the Karoo can be improved by providing a more reliable, more abundant, and lower-cost source of energy. Indeed, the South Africa government estimates that LNG will cost less to produce than the existing fossil fuel infrastructure.

 of South Africa confirmed Falcon Oil & Gas did not have permission to drill in their concession. They were forced to drop down as far as the Northern Cape and wait for the government to let them back in, which happened in 2016.

At the end of June 2013, South Africa had 3.5 tcf of proven shale gas reserves; by July 2014, it had 5.7 tcf. In September 2016, with the prospect of more fracking still uncertain, the total proved gas resources was 7 tcf, with a 3 tcf shortfall.

While South Africa's shale gas industry hopes to raise up to $250 billion in the years to come, and could grow to as high as 30 tcf in the next 15 years, the industry relies primarily on export markets like the US and Europe for revenues. However, with a potential of 6-8 tcf, South Africa now needs a substantial boost in domestic production to survive – which is where the industry's major investor, Shell, could step in to help.

Shell needs to step in to save the coal industry before it dies

In 2014, Shell sold its stake in the Anglo American Coal Company (AACCO), which in turn sold most of its coal assets to the Brazilian-backed Companhia Brasileira de Energia (Bras). While the sale of its coal reserves may appear positive on the surface, the reality is that BAEC was not as profitable as it believed, was hit by high costs (for such an essential product), and had a low reserve base. For example, in June 2010, BAEC reported it had 8.5 tcf of reserves (5.1 tcf undeveloped, 3.7 tcf developed), which it projected to reach 12 tcf in 2020 and 36.8 tcf in 2030.

It took three years for BAEC to turn those coal assets into a profitable business, according to a report released in March 2015 by consultancy firm KPMG. The report, The Coal Industry and the Future: The Lessons of Anglo American in South Africa and Brazil, states that it took BAEC over a decade to reach break-even with BAEC Brazil in 2013, which was a major loss.

The same report says BAEC's share of total sales was less than 10%. KPMG further stated that BAEC's coal production declined by 18% in 2013, "due to lower output in 2015 and production declines over the last 15 years". The report suggested BAEC had become a "low-profit, low-access company" and that its operations were too dependent on coal mining.

KPMG also revealed that BAEC's gas production from its mines fell from 2.7 million cubic feet in 1996 to 0.9 million cubic feet in 2015. For comparison, Brazil's largest producer, Vale, used 2.5 million cubic feet and the world's largest producer, BHP Billiton, used more than eight million cubic feet.

These low oil prices are a direct consequence of the decision by BHP Billiton and Anglo American to abandon the Brazilian part of their South African operations and focus their energies on the other two. BAEC was forced to look for alternative revenue sources, namely the export industry. But for BAEC, this was a desperate move that is bound to fail. BHP Billiton's move to switch over to "new coal" with no environmental regulation to keep the climate change in check was more obvious.

In June 2017, BG Group announced plans to sell its "significant share" in the Brazilian operation of BAEC. Shell would be the new majority shareholder in the Brazilian part of BAEC, which will become a subsidiary of BG Group in a cash transaction that is expected to close by late

According to a study released on July 8 by the CATO Institute, a think tank for conservative libertarians in Washington DC, the number of people seeking information online on conspiracy theories has doubled each year of Barack Obama's presidency. CATO's new study found that 473,000 unique individuals, including many Tea Party members, have visited its website since 2010 seeking to verify "conspiracy theories."

"From an intellectual, intellectual, social media perspective, that is a stunning figure," the CATO report said. "More than twice as many as when Barack Obama took office in January 2009, and over seven times as many as when George W Bush took office in 2001."

In late April, a local militia group called the Montana Freemen seized control of a federal government building in Freesontown, Montana, as part of a battle against federal agents and the federal government. The men, who are white, have expressed plans to take over a number of buildings across the country if Obama is re-elected by using violence if necessary. The Montana Freemen claim to have received inspiration for their actions from the Oath Keepers. During the election, at least five different militia groups in three different states declared themselves part of the "Texas Oath Keepers Militia."

One of them, the "Tacoma Branch of the Oath Keepers," took credit for the takeover of the U.S. courthouse in Tacoma, Washington, in late May. A video of the takeover posted online showed a man in camouflage wearing a military-style helmet and carrying what appeared to be a semi-automatic rifle pointed directly toward the faces of police officers.

In a statement to The Guardian, the Tacoma Branch of the Oath Keepers denied any involvement with the Freemen in any of their actions: "The individuals who broke into our facility in Freesontown are not members of Oath Keepers. Oath Keepers were never involved in the incident. Our facility in Freesontown is a legal facility that serves the public interest. We were not there during the incident."

The Freemen's claims that they received a direct order to hold their actions in Freesontown come amid growing concerns at the Freemen Movement's presence across the country. Last week, a federal judge in Washington state threw out Bundy's original lawsuit claiming that the county government denied a permit to the protesters to gather on the grounds that the federal government had created the Bundy Ranch in the first place.

Demonstrators carried signs reading "Stop Tyranny" and "The People's House is not a Jail" in front of the downtown court complex, chanting the familiar slogan of the Occupy Wall Street movement. "The government is tyrannical—this is a coup," one protester shouted. "The world is changing. We will not be held captive by this tyranny," another said.

On top of the discovery of a cache of guns, prosecutors also outlined two other incidents in which the same weapons were purchased and used by Bailey, both before and after the raid that turned up the weapons stockpiled in the bunker. According to the DOJ, in 2013, Bailey purchased an AR-15 style rifle from a company located near Fort Smith, in which an associate also purchased another weapon. In late 2015, Bailey returned to the same location and purchased another gun. According to the documents, Bailey gave the weapons to one of his employees for use in an AR-15 rifle battle at the family's hunting cabin, where they shot an unidentified animal to death.

On May 26, federal agents were called to the rural property near Kansas City, Missouri in connection with an armed standoff between a husband and wife over their dispute over their son. When the agents arrived on the scene, according to the DOJ, they found Bailey, who appeared agitated, near a pile of "large caliber semi-automatic firearms" and another pile of ammunition. Upon discovering Bailey's collection of weapons, the agents seized a total of 27 rifles, shotguns, rifles, pistols, and ammunition, according to news coverage.

After the DOJ released the details of the raid on May 27, and days later, a man claiming to be Bailey posted the following on a public Facebook page called Missouri Gun Rights, which he said were about an armed standoff in Kansas City: "A group of people armed as well with AR-15s (assault rifles), AR-10s / AK-47s(handguns), and other types of firearms went to our property today.

Giannis Antetokounmpo says he is open to playing for whatever team the Bucks decide to start him next season.

The Bucks released center Greg Monroe on Tuesday, ending their season, with little hope that they'll have to use the $27 million they owe him in the offseason.

The Bucks did not have to do that because they will have full cap space this summer and were able to match any offer Monroe had on the open market. But since the Bucks are going to move on from Monroe anyway, the timing makes sense to let him walk.

And the Bucks might not need Monroe's ability on the court after All-Star forward Jabari Parker sprained his left wrist during practice on Tuesday and is dealing with swelling in the shoulder.

Giannis did not give a specific timetable during a one-on-one interview with USA TODAY Sports, but said he would have no problem playing with the Bucks through

According to the US Attorney's Office, "The contents of the package included 119 rounds of reloaded .50 caliber cartridges with M48A1 incendiary projectiles, and 200 rounds of 14.5mm M183A1 spotting projectiles which contain an explosive charge."

Most Americans are surprised when I tell them that I'm working on the book, or that it addresses such a contentious subject.

The notion that libertarians are embracing capitalism is hardly a new development. From the founding of the United States, capitalists and free merchants have had conflicting ways of looking at the market and its economic system.

One strain of capitalist thought, championed by John Law and Thomas Jefferson, saw the market as an expression of free people trying to meet their needs and desires. They believed that competition, entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurship are what make commerce a flourishing marketplace.

Anthropologists and anthropologists often portray capitalism as a "natural" state for humanity, created by market forces and social norms. Such a view was prevalent in the classical liberal tradition of the nineteenth century, and still has influence today.


Thomas L. Friedman, the free-trade economist, is typical of this vision when he argued during the last few months of the presidential campaign that the free market will return and we should give it a chance to work.

"People who have never owned a home before or had to make three incomes or are under 25 years old should be allowed to own one," Friedman wrote in The New York Times. "And you have a right to invest your own money in whatever kind of businesses you like."

For classical-liberal economists, capitalism was an economic system that, like the human body, could either be healthy and vigorous or malformed and disfigured.

A second, more pessimistic strain of capitalism believed that capitalism's success depended on how efficiently it served the interests of elites. These theorists tended to argue that the only thing that mattered were profits and the shareholders' self-interests.


They did not see the market as a means to achieve the best outcomes for those least wealthy. In the words of John Kenneth Galbraith, a leading British free-market economist at this time (who is now dead):


"The idea was that all we were interested in was not the actual conditions of the individual, but his relative position in the capitalist economic order.

That was the way the economist Richard Tawney phrased it, in a way that suggested you were the rich and lazy child of social workers rather than a free-thinking kid from Queens, who decided to live independently and start his own business."


What about today? Is the "libertarian" streak in the American electorate as virulent and pervasive as it was in the past?

The answer is that the movement has grown significantly over time. And a growing number of those on the political left, even those with more extreme views than Friedman, embrace what's been considered American capitalism. They believe that the free market has become distorted, distorted.


These people believe that the current system is exploitative and unfair, and wants to do something about it, even if the solution relies on a change in political direction.

As for the right, it's also grown in recent years, to an extent that is new to the history of the Republic.

 movement by retweeting an image falsely claiming that Obama was not born in America. On May 19, Trump tweeted a quote that went viral, claiming, among other things, that the government was covering up a terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on April 16, when a van full of Afghan refugees drove into a military base, killing four American servicemen and injuring 12. The president called the attack an "attack on our country."

The day after the attack, however, as the Pentagon issued an official warning about the threat posed by the Afghan asylum-seekers, a Fox News anchor asked the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, in an off-the-record briefing, if he was aware of any reports that some of the attackers had come from Iraq or Syria. (The White House denied ever knowing about the refugees.)

According to the May 19 incident report of the raid for which Bailey is charged, ATF agents were dispatched to Bailey's home on a federal probation warrant for drug trafficking. Investigators seized multiple weapons and ammunition, some of which, a grand jury indictment said, were illegally imported into the US. At the house, "the defendant's wife was arrested and admitted to the investigators that the weapons were registered to Mr. Bailey."

The indictment also contained claims "that during the prior several years, [Bailey] purchased or obtained a gun from at least four persons, who were deceased, who in turn purchased or obtained a gun from him." In August 2011, according to court papers, Bailey, accompanied by an undercover agent, was in possession of a .38-caliber revolver that the ATF had flagged. A federal judge in Texas had ordered the confiscation of the weapon and ordered Bailey to appear in federal court in Austin within a matter of days.

According to court filings, Bailey had bought the gun legally. As a matter of record, in October, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives issued Bailey a Notice of Proposed Withholding of a Firearm License. The ATF then filed a petition for temporary restraining order in a federal court in Houston, seeking to have the restraining order overturned. In September—after he was charged with the federal weapons violations—B.J. Bailey was released on a $2,500 bond and returned to court to show that the rifle could not fit in his hands without causing him injury. He pleaded guilty to a lesser weapons charge.

When the court hearing ended with Judge Michael P. Chikindas accepting the gun-control arguments, "many people left the courtroom crying or yelling," according to an account by the Associated Press. Bailey then took the stand and told the judge that he had been given the gun as part of an FBI sting operation.

"You're a coward!" the judge said.

Bailey did not respond to requests for comment.

If Bailey's wife was arrested after May 19 and has been jailed pending further court proceedings related to the weapons offense, it is unclear whether she has entered a plea or if she has been convicted.

In the wake of this raid, the Southern Poverty Law Center put out a document warning that the "Patriot movement" was seeking to "migrate to the area" of the home of a black couple in nearby Lufkin, Texas. The listing for the Lufkin property identifies the owners as Charles and Mary Jones, though, as the SPLC report notes, the listing does not clearly refer to Charles Jones as Charles Bailey. The SPLC does note that Mary Jones has lived in the district since at least 1977. "Although not on the agenda for today, the Patriot movement did have other meetings in Lufkin" in April, the SPLC notes.<|endoftext|>The U.S. Food and Drug

In a new book, a journalist has uncovered the extraordinary saga of how this felted fellow – dubbed 'Fiona' – has spent the past 15 years as an unlikely household icon as an unlikely fixture on the pages of a comic tome.

The Cat in the Hat: The Life and Art of Hugh Herr from the World's Feline, is billed as "the story of the most beautiful cat in the world" and chronicles Herr's career as an illustrator during which he produced a book of artwork to accompany his story. The book has gone back to print and features art by Herr and his cats as well as rare and signed photographs from their owners.

Fiona has also gone down in the record books. According to Guinness Book of Records, this cat is the longest-serving furry celebrity to be recognised in the company of such iconic humans as Steve Irwin and Elvis Presley.

"This cat – dubbed 'Fiona' at the time, before the fame of his feline artistry – has taken the world by storm," the book's author Tom Doyle writes. "We thought that she would be a feline, but she's a living, breathing embodiment of the human spirit."


The Cat in the Hat is a compilation of material from two years' worth of interviews, spanning from Herr's first days as a cat painter to his retirement following his success in the art world as an artist of fine art. The author says the resulting book is "absolutely astonishing and, in many ways, sad, as you feel for Hugh the cat".

"He was on his road to success and the success of his art, but his life, and the events of that time and the life of the family he left behind, left their mark on the most wonderful individual," Doyle writes.

The book's publisher, Taschen, says his work is still being produced, but not for sale.

The Cat in the Hat first appeared as part of a comic strip in the January 1949 edition of the Charlton newspaper strip. The cartoonist and artist was based in Philadelphia, PA at the time, and this was her first comic art venture. Herr was soon contacted by his publishers and soon turned his artistic talents to the comic strip.

A few months later, Herr moved to New York, where he was soon in demand to illustrate a variety of stories in the New Yorker as well as comic strips in the New York World and the Daily World. Herr's artistic career took off with an illustration for the March 1950 edition of the New Yorker, which featured a fictionalized version of himself as a cat.

"It's a man's world," said David Beckham, in a candid interview with our own Jeremy M. Kogan, who attended the event. While other people at the press conference were talking about the players, the legendary soccer star was talking about a much smaller issue: the need to do something to save "American soccer in this country."

David Beckham's father, David Jr., is not a stranger to the big stage. He has competed with England's national team before and appeared as an announcer during the FIFA 2010 World Cup in South Africa. He also played as a goalkeeper for the LA Galaxy, during a game that resulted in the famous "We are the Champions."

But now, as Beckham spoke, he was talking about something of an issue that touches the lives of many thousands of young players, as they prepare for the first kick of the 2015 MLS season: the lack of playing time for the youngsters.

"This is a crisis we're currently facing," said Beckham, a retired England captain who is chairman of the Manchester United FC Foundation. "American players don't have [enough] playing time, and you're not going to have players of talent or skill if we don't do something about it."

At the recent MLS Players Union summit in New York, commissioner Don Garber said there would be action taken to make sure more American talent gets playing time. In England, as far as he is concerned, time is of the essence.

"I have to believe this is our No. 1 priority," said Garber, who believes this "must involve a series of very aggressive initiatives, to give our young players playing time," and that the first thing that must come next is "significant investment in our academies."

David Beckham hopes to see some changes at the youngest American soccer programs.

Beckham said that, when he was playing, "I was very fortunate" to play with "great national team coaches." The United States national team, he noted, can be a good teacher, but it was also not an easy place to play. "The quality of the facilities was not good enough," he said.

"That changed when I played, and so to see those kids who want to play are coming out into the game is fantastic," said Beckham, citing a recent youth clinic at Manchester United's training complex. "I always like when I think about this in history: The great thing is that the next generation is getting better and better."

Beckham isn't alone in his quest. Some players on a team that reached the final of the 2002 World Cup are now coaching in the professional game.

"Every coach I've ever worked with will tell you they want more American players," said former

Oklahoma State junior WR Josh Stewart will forego his final year of eligibility and enter the NFL draft. A wiry 5-foot-10, 180(ish) pounds, Stewart led the Cowboys with 60 catches this season, but managed just 703 yards. Rotoworld's Josh Norris likes Stewart's ability to find creases in the defense, but believes he's a day-three prospect. Stewart is an excellent punt returner, however, which should help his stock. Stewart could do himself a world of good with a strong Combine.

148 Marcell Ateman Out of FB

Raiders waived WR Marcell Ateman. Ateman had a big preseason but was buried behind Amari Cooper, Jordy Nelson, Martavis Bryant, and Seth Roberts. The Raiders will try to sneak Ateman on their practice squad.

149 Jake Wieneke Out of FB

Vikings signed South Dakota State WR Jake Wieneke. Wienecke (6'4/221) graduated as the Missouri Valley Conference record holder in career catches (288), receiving yards (5,157), and receiving TDs (59). Wieneke's sub-par athleticism was exposed at the Combine with 4.67 speed and eighth-percentile SPARQ results. Wieneke is a creative and sometimes dominant contested-catch winner and could make a living as a special teamer and red-zone contributor, or perhaps even a slot receiver. He won't win one-on-one battles against NFL corners on the outside.

150 Cobi Hamilton Out of FB

Colts signed WR Cobi Hamilton. To make room for Hamilton, the Colts cut backup running back Tion Green. Hamilton suited up three times for Houston last year, managing a single catch for eight yards on six targets. Even with T.Y. Hilton (shoulder) and others banged up, the 2013 sixth-rounder is just a depth option for Indy.

49ers selected Michigan State WR Aaron Burbridge with the No. 213 overall pick of the 2016 NFL draft. Burbridge (6'0/206) earned 2015's Big Ten Receiver of the Year, wrapping his career with 165 catches for 2,174 yards (13.2

Already 24 years old, Luckett faces an uphill climb as an overaged prospect with pedestrian physical attributes.

Bills signed WR Jarrett Boykin to a reserve/future contract. Boykin was out of the league for the entire 2015 season after spending the preseason with the Panthers. He caught nine balls for 93 yards in exhibition play. Boykin was Tyrod Taylor's top target at Virginia Tech.

49ers signed WR Lance Lewis. A 2012 UDFA out of East Carolina, Lewis spent time with the Redskins and Cowboys last season. He has zero catches in three career games. The 49ers waive/injured WR Chuck Jacobs to make room for Lewis. Jacobs tore his ACL in the 49ers' preseason opener.

Eagles waived WR Joe Anderson. Anderson was signed by the Eagles a month ago. Despite receiving a relatively lofty $20,000 offseason signing bonus, the 2012 undrafted free agent and potential special teamer doesn't even make it to the offseason program.

Free agent WR Jeremy Kerley worked out for the Patriots on Wednesday. New England's top receiving options this year have been tight end Rob Gronkowski, running back James White and a ham sandwich. Jokes aside, the Patriots are desperate for play-makers on offense, though help may be on the way with Josh Gordon expected to debut this week and Julian Edelman eligible to return from suspension in Week 5. Kerley was let go by Buffalo earlier this month. He'll just be a depth option if he signs.

2 Rishard Matthews Out of FB

Titans released WR Rishard Matthews. This was really the only possible outcome after Matthews walked away from the team this week. Tennessee's No. 1 receiver each of the last two seasons, Matthews is talented and has consistently produced when given the opportunity. This incident could scare off a few teams, but it would be a surprise if he does not land somewhere in the near future. With Matthews out the door, Corey Davis is locked into the No. 1 role, and talented sophomore Taywan Taylor should see more chances.

Free agent WR Roddy White retired from the NFL after 11 seasons. White was out of the league last season after getting cut by the Falcons in 2016. White faded late in his career, but he'll still go down as one of the better receivers of the last 15 years. In his prime, White recorded six straight 1,000-yard seasons, earning four Pro Bowl nods in that span. He'll retire as Atlanta's all-time leader in catches (808), receiving yards (10,863) and receiving touchdowns (63). All of those records should eventually be broken by Julio Jones.

Colts coach Chuck Pagano said the team is considering signing a veteran free agent receiver. The Colts waived Josh Boyce on Saturday. Boyce had been getting reps as the No. 4 wideout behind T.Y.

ed jab before it, this time against another southpaw, which can make landing the left straight more difficult.

Defensively, Till seems to have taken his Muay Thai very seriously. The pulling straight back from attacks and mugging in between his opponent's misses is something you will recognize from many great Nak Muay, even if at times it comes off as an awkward Saenchai impression. Till will occasionally show a smooth pivot but most of his defensive work is retreating from range, or advancing to the clinch as his opponent moves forward. From there Till looks for those classic Muay Thai style foot sweeps which Matt Brown popularized in mixed martial arts.

Hypothetical Gameplans

Darren Till brings several elements to the table which seem as though they could spell trouble for Donald Cerrone. The long left straight down the center of Cerrone's often porous defense could prove a treat, and the counter left straight as Cerrone steps up to kick might be just as useful. Limiting the pace of the fight can encourage overcommitments from a higher output fighter like Cerrone. Secondly Till, once again a southpaw, is a constant threat with the left kick to the body.

 out by a right hand while southpaw, but he hasn't been knocked either, so if you can avoid the damage, then he will likely go back to throwing with greater frequency. In fact, by the time Till steps in it's usually too late to really make a difference. When he doesn't look as though he can be taken seriously in his counter left hand, though, all bets are off.

In spite of these challenges, Till does not stand a chance. If he goes for a full swing and Cerrone backs out or eats his lead leg kick, everything is for naught. He gets absolutely annihilated when he goes to the clinch with Cerrone. Even more so if he takes a step forward and allows his hands to pass. He is still able to put up a good fight in that aspect, but the real danger lies behind the clinch.

The clinch could be his Achilles' heels for all I know but if he fights the best fighters in his division in the clinch he could have a problem. Till looks great in a clinch, and perhaps more important for Cerrone's game plan, he is very effective at getting there.

There is one potential scenario where Till might be able to get out and use his hands more effectively and use his jab more effectively, but that is if he finds Cerrone throwing at high rates, which he might have to do in order to maintain the distance he wants.

As it stands there are plenty of other variables at work in this fight, and all of them are potentially lethal. It's a longshot, but Till's style and history are enough to suggest that he remains a significant threat at 170 pounds, if he chooses to step into that division.

Why a Muay Thai Fight Isn't an Easy Fight<|endoftext|>HBO's Game of Thrones ended Sunday with the shocking shock of what happened to Dany's beloved dragons. However, the season finale also found out one very important thing:

Jon Snow is a bastard, a child of incest. He's the Stark child, son of Ned Stark and Lyanna Stark, and he has a special place at the Throne of Winter from which he can finally deliver the Iron Throne to the rightful King in the North (the rightful Queen, too, because that's what Westeros is). In the end, the episode ended with Jon Snow's true parentage revealed to everyone and his whole legacy as a character in peril. In the books (written before the TV show even began filming), the character Jon Snow is also revealed to have a parentage in this series. The showrunners made the move to give Jon a legitimate mother in the books for three reasons.


The most obvious of these is that they want to appeal to fans of the books and series by making sure the ending for Jon Snow is a happy one. This was very much a conscious change made in the books after the season 1 finale in order to attract the book readers — something they really did try and do. They wanted to show Jon in conflict with everyone in the narrative — his family, his father, and his brother Bran — and then show him at the end with a peaceful end. In the books, we see Jon after the battle at Hardhome, still conflicted, not only because he wasn't in Westeros, but also because he wasn't in the presence of R+L=J and Varys. In the television show, he's found himself in the presence of those men in the series premiere and is able to fully join them in the fight

 out yet and his kicks are still his bread and butter but it is also his only offensive weapon at the moment.

The key to defeating the Cerrone defense will be getting Till off the inside by getting him to step out and take Cerrone's punches into his own head. Till, who has had some quality success with his lead left hand, could turn the fight around very easily if he is able to land his head kick more effectively; however, for that to happen he will probably need to be the aggressor, which he is not. The best way that Till can win this fight is by picking apart his opponent's head movement. If Till can manage to get his long left straight into Cerrone's chin and force the Cerrone to defend it, Cerrone's chin or his chin alone will be the deciding factor on the outcome. If he can force Cerrone to defend his head kicks and Cerrone is forced to back up into a straight or straight up jab, Till might be able to sneak his left straight home or follow up with a right hand.

Till also takes many of Roy Jones Jr.'s techniques to an extreme. In particular you can't help but notice the emphasis on leaning far forward and leaning toward the opponent. While Jones has always fought defensively, but has always been capable of pushing his opponent right into his own punches with his jab, most fighters tend towards the side the attack is coming from. Till's stance on this fight will be somewhat similar to Jones', favoring a more front heavy stance in his back pocket. However, unlike Jones, Till will be swinging his lead hand low over his right side, putting more of his lead hand in contact with the target, rather than being far back over his left shoulder. If this strategy proves effective it will mean Till will have to lean far forward so he can throw head kicks or be forced into a hook or cross, or at best a straight shot for a takedown. So far Till has shown signs of being effective with that approach.

Another key difference is that Till has never made it past the opening round in any of his fights at 135lbs and beyond. This does open the door for Cerrone, but if he is able to get a submission or knockout he is going to have a tough fight ahead of him. By the time Till goes to the middle rounds there could be the beginnings of a strategy that will be very tough to slow down. While Till has had his struggles in the middle rounds of his fights with many of his opponents, the most recent bout against Neil Magny he had a dominant unanimous decision win over. He is a tremendous talent and has had some fights that are hard to forget, but he was fighting the same opponents for 10 rounds in each fight. He has been knocked out or submitted in almost every fight he's entered since then and he has suffered losses to most of the fighters who have dropped the fight in the later rounds. We can all agree that a more defensive Donald Cerrone would be more suited to the middle rounds or the later rounds than he should be in the middle of the night.

Conclusion

Although his name is unlikely to stick you for the long term, Donald Cerrone may someday find himself in the UFC welterweight division. At only 35ish years old he has been knocking on the door as a top tier lightweight for years but has seen little action. This lack of action is to his advantage and if he can make a strong showing against Darren Till, who has a ton of potential in the future he might find himself in the mix sooner rather than later. At 39 years old Cerrone has the potential for the title shot, and even with the injury that knocked him out of his last fight Donald C

 out yet (with the sole exception of Carlos Condit at UFC 143), but Till is still able to set up counters and land plenty of the leg kicks that have gotten him this far.

The final key to stopping Cerrone would seem to be an accurate right cross in combination with a left hook. Till's left cross is excellent and he's landed almost as many inside the opponent's right lead as right crosses from the right hand range. He will often take the left straight in the lead hook range or step into a right straight from the rear hand. A straight right from a counter right hand could put Donald just out of range or in trouble and could lead to a round three KO.

With one of the most aggressive striking teams in the game there is no doubt Darren Till's team will start the fight well positioned to push their opponent around. Till has a real shot to steal the fight tonight. I expect Darren Till to be able to get the victory which is a very big step up from the loss to Donald Cerrone which was a one punch knockout. Till can be a force to be reckoned with down this road.<|endoftext|>Cops find woman who allegedly attacked 3 men in L.A.

The two men allegedly assaulted in a robbery on Wednesday night in the Van Nuys neighborhood in Los Angeles were also robbed twice in a matter of hours in other parts of the city, police said. No charges had been filed against them or the woman in either of those robberies.

The women were the victims of three robbery attempts within two hours during the evening of Wednesday, May 15, according to police.

Police in Van Nuys say a robbery suspect tried to rob the 18-year-old and 19-year-old victims shortly before midnight on Thursday at an apartment complex on West 1st Street just east of Avenue J. One of the victims was able to knock the robber out while the other two were able to escape. But when the woman approached them a short time later and demanded their belongings, both men ran away as the woman grabbed a knife, police said. The suspects in that robbery were identified as 20-year-old Justin Sanchez and 19-year-old Joshua Ocampo.

The second robbery happened during the early morning hours of Thursday, May 16 at about 11 a.m. near the corner of 6th Street and San Fernando Road. When a 24-year-old woman was approached by a man named "Brett," police said they intervened and found him carrying a knife, according to a news release. The woman was able to scare off the man with the knife and later helped another victim, a 24-year-old man, to get away, police said.

The two women were then robbed by a man identified as 21-year-old Demarco Jones. According to police, police learned this robbery was not linked to the first attempted robbery on Thursday night and neither of the women were injured, though two of them suffered minor injuries as a result of being struck with the victim's knife as he fled.

Jones was found and released from jail after being booked on suspicion of robbery and battery and resisting arrest. In a third robbery, a 38-year-old man was assaulted at about 10 p.m. Thursday near the intersection of Broadway and South Flower Street. The man, whose name was not released, was able to escape from two assailants who took away his belongings, police said.

 out yet, and he did so to many experienced wrestlers in 2011. The left uppercut as Cerrone moves forward is a very welcome part of his game but Till's most dangerous weapon may be his low kick, which can come in on any angle and be delivered at the perfect time. The first punch is his jab which could be a significant liability to his opponent in the fight between the two featherweights. With his reach, Till could even use this jab to find an opening behind the counter left straight. The low kick as a third weapon should be very effective.

With these theoretical considerations in mind, let's dive in to the bout!<|endoftext|>As a new generation of young professional women emerge to work in finance these days, women still occupy a largely male role on Wall Street. But is it really a disadvantage to be female on Wall Street? Well…

Let's remember that female financiers are typically hired by banks looking to attract younger talent with better prospects of advancing to the senior ranks. The reason for that is because most senior ranks on Wall Street still run by men in their 50s and 60s.

But that makes this whole discussion completely moot. It's more of a reflection of the nature of Wall Street, where women are often at the outer edges of the financial services sector.

As a result, a group of top female bankers have a "glass ceiling" policy in place which aims to ensure that young women do not feel excluded and are provided an alternative to that. According to The Independent:

The Wall Street Women's Network will be publishing a series of articles, including this one, designed to give a voice to female financiers who have not made it to the top ranks in the industry… The group's aims include increasing the number of women in senior roles, including those in regulatory and financial oversight roles.

But while these women have the glass ceiling in place to protect them, there are women on Wall Street who have not had that option to protect them. They are female bankers in middle age or older, like Sara Blakely, now an analyst for the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates in New York.

In a recent piece by The Daily Mail, you can read about how an elderly female banker who worked in private banking and now manages pensions for Fortune 500 companies was forced to retire because her pension fund was underfunded.

How is that possible?

Well, it's not.

It's all about the math.

For any investment fund to go from zero as a seed fund into being worth $100 billion as an investment fund, it first needs to grow it's principal balance each year by enough to cover its investment costs (a risk management fee to manage the fund).

In an aged investment fund and especially one such as Bridgewater's pension fund, the principal balance grows much faster than it does in other investment funds because the costs per unit of portfolio is much lower, and therefore is growing at a far faster rate. When you're running an investment fund yourself, that means your principal is growing at a far greater rate.

As an investment manager, it's even worse because you're running a much larger unit of portfolio with higher returns. In fact, if you ran such a large investment fund now, you couldn't even get your funds to buy a single share at a time. In order to continue to be able to purchase any single share in a fund, you'd need to run a smaller fund.

So yes, there may be an advantage for older professionals. But at the end of the day, that only benefits the investor who was the first to own the shares.

As a result, pension funds will continue to invest in aged investment units rather than younger ones,

Annuities and adverse selection

Region: You've done a lot of work on annuities and adverse selection, including some of your early work with Jim Poterba2 and more recent work both with him and with others. The initial work provided important clues as to why the market for long-term annuities is so small when theory predicts that many people would benefit from purchasing them. What's your explanation? What did you find in that research?

Peter Tenzer

Finkelstein: The work that Jim and I did showed that adverse selection exists in annuity markets. An annuity is a survival-contingent income product. So individuals who think they are likely to be long-lived are "high risk" from the insurance company's perspective.

We found that individuals who are longer-lived are more likely to buy an annuity and to buy annuities whose payments are more backloaded, meaning that adverse selection distorts not just the share of individuals with annuities
==================== COMPLETION 105 ====================
 who are longer-lived, but also the distribution of their annuity payouts.

Region: This is a fascinating paper, and it's a great example of what I'm talking about. You're right that the data for the longer-lived individuals in the sample are limited, so you could have made some adjustments. However, most of the changes in the longer-lived individuals' mortality and payouts seem to correspond roughly to changes in the premiums and fees that individual retirees pay. And in one case, you actually go through the changes separately for each age group, so the change in the payout is large at different ages for different people. It's very good work.

Finkelstein: Yeah, I'd seen the changes in annuity earnings over time as part of the work of Bob Shiller for many years, and it does look like people's annuities behave in a way that allows some people to take advantage of the death penalty as they age in the absence of adverse selection.

Region: The interesting point is that your research also shows this phenomenon when analyzing individual annuities. So the reason we can't know by looking at individual annuities is not a lack of interest, but a lack of data. Why were you unable to find this information in the annuity data?

Finkelstein: The problem of how to handle adverse selection is really one that's related to risk. Suppose one of the assumptions that you have in an insurance company is that everyone is likely to survive. So you've got this assumption that you should make premiums more generous when people have better or better-protected life expectancies. But your assumptions aren't always true.

In the case of annuities, if you had a death benefit that was based on how long you were going to live, you would get people who were going to be really healthy at age 50 — I think that's the right age to start thinking there's a very strong market in them. These individuals are not as likely to pay out as much as you might expect. But if you have an assumption of lifetime earnings as the basis of your annuity premium, you're going to have someone who survives very long and doesn't give all that much as an annuitant and has a very lucrative life after retirement. That individual is going to be a good-longevity risk for the insurance company. And this could explain what we do see in individual annuity data when we look at the distribution of annuitized payouts.

Region: You've done a lot of work with other insurance companies, though. How do they treat the issue?

Finkelstein: When I talk to other insurance companies, I hear that they are very interested in understanding what it's like for people to be long-lived, about what's the value of longevity in life insurance. And, for example, people ask, "Can death benefit premiums be raised, but I have to pay extra for it?" And insurance companies say, "Absolutely. That's an important question."

So you don't hear complaints like, "Oh, you guys don't want people to go to jail!" Because it's a very attractive option for insurance companies. They want people who are going to live long lives and give good returns.

What I find that's fascinating is that when you ask people the risk that they might be long-lived, they are generally willing to pay more than an equivalent amount of risk on the other side, especially if it's a large and potentially risky number or they think, "If I get hit by a bus, I'll get money from this insurance company." But insurance companies don't ask, "Do you want to get hit by a bus?"

We don

==================== COMPLETION 106 ====================
 but also the distribution of these annuities.

I would describe that work as supporting the theory that certain people who have the potential to die at the young age of 60-65 are over-insured. This implies that, for those people, the insurance market is under-pricing mortality risk. I would also say that the findings apply in the context of annuities, which is a market, in my view, that is too small for the purpose of testing for health and pension benefits under adverse selection.

Region: Why is this important?

Tenzer: As you well know, this is an area of study where it costs a substantial amount of money to conduct a study. In most of the case I have reviewed, the insurers have charged tens of thousands of dollars to conduct these studies that reveal that people who think they are likely to die young are over-insured and must be compensated for the over-insurance.

If somebody has heard an insurance executive talking to the press about how he has spent tens of thousands of dollars to prove that they're too safe, you know what that means? It means that they have a serious bias against anybody who claims the insurance industry has made a grave mistake in assessing risk. They aren't concerned about that. They are interested only in helping the insurance industry raise profits.

There is a very sophisticated class of economists who have been looking at this topic and have reached a similar conclusion as that of the economists I describe above. I believe these economists should have made their conclusions available to the public, to be discussed and debated, so that everybody can know what the results are. But they have all been silent, which is really telling.

Region: Why don't you go into more detail in your paper?

Tenzer: Let me first give you the explanation of "subsidies" in terms of my original paper with Jim Poterba. We were working with the same person (who happens to be my husband – Jim and I had an intellectual dispute in the early days of our marriage about the proper treatment of pension policy in pension plans). Both of us believe that a very high proportion of people do not live long enough to use retirement incomes and pensions, and that insurance companies should make it as easy as possible for them to use them.

For example, Jim and I had tried to get the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to include more actuarial assumptions into their calculations related to the use of annuities to assess the health costs of retirees. But this was not done because the actuaries wanted to avoid a "penalty" in the actuarial assumptions. It would be unfair to make these assumptions.

In this scenario, the pension benefit is essentially the annuity. The penalty in the annuity would be too high. This is exactly what Jim and I argued was happening in government agencies assessing the use of pensions and annuities. The actuaries wanted to avoid the adverse selection problem. By not including the adverse selection problem in the calculations of pension and annuities, the government agencies were essentially underpricing death.

To make this case more simply – and to be consistent with the logic of the original paper – let's say that we are talking about the assumption in the assumptions that the annuity is guaranteed at an inflation rate equal to the rate of inflation, no matter what happens in the economy. So that you always get back the same annuity.

Our claim is that the annuity guaranteed rate of return on the annuity is going to be higher than the rate provided by any insurance company. This claim is supported by our original model. In fact, the model showed that the insurance company's price for the annuity would be about the same as the price for

We found that individuals who are longer-lived are more likely to buy an annuity and to buy annuities whose payments are more backloaded, meaning that adverse selection distorts not just the share of individuals with annuities
==================== COMPLETION 107 ====================
, but also the prices of annuities.

The result was that when people buy an annuity for someone with whom they are unlikely to have children, the annuity premium goes up to compensate the insurance company for the risk. That increase in premium is offset when they take out their annuity and have children, and so the premiums keep going up even though the risk is decreased. That sort of adverse selection keeps annuity premiums high for everyone.

Region: You've also done work on a new approach to insurance—one that focuses on the "naturalness" of death. You find that in general, people with a better understanding of death—whether that's the cause of mortality or its consequences—have a better ability to predict, predict better than the typical elderly person, which annuities will pay down the most over long periods of time. Do you think the same is true within annuity markets? How might it vary with age?

Peter Tenzer

Finkelstein: Yes, death knowledge can lead to a better ability to predict which annuities will pay up the most.

When people who have greater knowledge of death are younger, they might not be as good at predicting the longevity of the individual they are selecting for. I've often thought that the reason we keep buying death annuities for the same people over and over again is that we're only interested by longevity when we're young.

Region: People have criticized your work for relying on data from one individual, the deceased Mark Twain. Is there data you use to help with your prediction that people living longer will be more likely to use annuities—and therefore, have less risk with them—than people who die early?

Peter Tenzer

Finkelstein: Yes, there are datasets that go back decades from which to analyze risk and death, and there are data that we can use from people who die, where we can statistically examine the differences between the elderly population and people who would have died young.

Region: You've argued that as we live longer, people who die younger have more chance of surviving a major illness than people who die later. Is there really a benefit to living longer, and is it more important to have as many people in existence as possible? And how are those benefits linked to annuities?

Peter Tenzer

Finkelstein: There are so many benefits to living longer. Life expectancy is increasing in many places. That's great. But there's a question here: Where can life expectancy get to? Why can't we have a world where everybody lives a whole lot longer? I want people to be able to think back to their parents' age and say, "How did they look when they were your age?" That's what I want people to try to achieve, not an artificial maximum age. I want people to go ahead and extend their lives, for the purposes of the world in which they live, as long as they can, as much as they can.

Region: Given that, you'd say it's better to be alive longer, too, for these reasons. Do you think there will be a trade off between longer life and more annuities: A longer live means fewer annuities, because we would expect there to be a lower risk of death and higher likelihood of survival. This could give rise to this sort of paradox. Do you think it will happen? How could this work to increase the size of annuities, as well?

Peter Tenzer

Finkelstein: The basic intuition is this: If you know you are less likely to die in the first place and you have a higher chance of surviving a major illness when you're old, if

Peter Tenzer

Finkelstein: The work that Jim and I did showed that adverse selection exists in annuity markets. An annuity is a survival-contingent income product. So individuals who think they are likely to be long-lived are "high risk" from the insurance company's perspective.

We found that individuals who are longer-lived are more likely to buy an annuity and to buy annuities whose payments are more backloaded, meaning that adverse selection distorts not just the share of individuals with annuities
==================== COMPLETION 108 ====================
 but also the share of people with annuities. The backloading approach gives an advantage to people who are more than a few years from death and for whom the cost of their death is a significant burden.

In particular, if someone dies before reaching age 70, we show that they are less likely than younger individuals to have an annuity that's likely to pay a high-interest rate, because that backloading option is too expensive.

But as for how adverse selection operates for these people, the most likely explanation is that the insurance market isn't working quite as well as the market should on behalf of long-lived individuals. These individuals know more about their likelihood of survival and can more accurately take into account the costs of being alive. Their decisions are more affected by other things, such as their health-status predictability—a phenomenon known as health status persistence. It's a very large phenomenon.

Region: For example, if you're a single man 40 years old, you've done quite well for yourself. But what about someone in, say, California, 40 years old? That guy is likely to die before you?

Tenzer: Absolutely. If he's a young man, an individual in California is not as healthy as is an individual in, say, Michigan. The California individual will typically have poorer health as a result of his lower mortality rate.

Region: And how does health-status persistence apply to retirement savings?

Tenzer: If you're a 65 year-old white American man today, you have the same risk as someone who is an 18 year-old black American man today.

Region: Let me see if I have this straight: If you have a very high probability of death, you have higher probabilities of being an older old person for whom health-status persistence matters. For that reason, it's not surprising that insurance companies would be more likely to offer insurance for younger, healthier people, because they'd have some higher risk with older, sicker individuals.

Yet I wonder: Do you know of any people who are 65 years old and don't have annuities? Or any people who are 65 years old and are buying an annuity?

I'm talking about people who are not getting an annuity, and they're not getting an annuity from you.

Tenzer: No. I can't think of any.

We think that people with a higher level of long-lasting health are less likely to sell their annuities.

Region: Do you think people who have higher risks also tend to be good at saving?

Tenzer: We think that people with a higher level of long-lasting health are less likely to sell their annuities.

In this regard, we're trying to understand the "dance of the annuity." What we see happening there is that if you sell your annuity, you're no longer a long-term individual. You're just a risk who's going to live a long time. If you were a long-term individual, you'd sell the annuity. But, of course, the insurance companies are not necessarily willing to let you sell the annuity. You can't be a risk who lives very long because they'd have to take care of you if you are very ill.

If, as Peter describes, the market is working properly, it should be able to take care of us if we're very sick. There's nothing inherently wrong with going to the insurance company to sell the annuity, as long as you're not a risk who lives very long.

Region: This is an interesting, nuanced answer. Most people in America probably think that health-status persists is

For those who like one day, two days. I have an idea for a very dark and twisted fic after RWBY season 5 and I hope you enjoy.

'So, what does Blake want?

Jaune Arc was tired. He looked down at the coffee cup in his lap and frowned, not from the fact that he hadn't done anything for an entire day but from the fact that he had to get up early again tomorrow. He was just waking up once more so he needed to get some good rest and get his mind off of the world as well as the hunt.

The only thing he had on his mind, he thought as he put the cup down on the table, was his relationship with Pyrrha Nikos. It wasn't an easy one for Jaune, as even his best friend Yang couldn't help but complain about it. Jaune had never admitted it to anyone but Pyrrha. The only time he had ever openly spoken of it was with Raven, in a room at the library. She had told him that he was not what he used to be. That he hadn't lived up to his abilities and that his abilities were not what he had once thought after his training with the Mistralian Paladin's. She went on to explain that in a way he was still in training, not with any Mistralian Paladin's but with Pyrrha.

The only good part about this was that he didn't have to face anything about the girl he called his girlfriend ever again. That was what seemed to keep Jaune going, the fact that if his best friend was mad about it he would deal with it behind his back, something he was willing to do regardless of her intentions. Jaune had been with a lot of girls in his life but Pyrrha was his first genuine girlfriend. Despite what Yang and Ruby would say, Pyrrha had been the only girl other than Blake who had ever truly loved him. He had taken that time during his training with Pyrrha to get stronger and as a result Jaune had now found himself being able to hold his own much earlier than

LC-only and each leverage a single controller. In other words, because the PX600 and SX300 are using the same controller platform and the same raw NAND, provisioning the same amount of raw storage in the same way would yield similar or identical performances between the two drives.

The Fusion ioMemory PX600 is the new workhorse, aimed at providing the highest transaction rate for high performance applications that lean toward mixed read/write workloads. The PX600 comes in 1TB, 1.3TB and 2.6TB capacities in HHHL form factors and a 5.2TB option in a FHHL form factor, all interfacing over PCIe 2.0 x8.

Though the overall product lineup has been simplified, the core Fusion architecture has not. Both designs feature a programmable FPGA, offering greater long-term flexibility and update support compared to an ASIC design. While all the drives in the new Atomic family use MLC, Fusion-io has migrated to a smaller 20nm lithography this time. However, smaller NAND die is a double-edged sword; the shrink allows for capacity gains (up to 5.2TB in the PX600), but it also presents new engineering challenges.

==================== COMPLETION 113 ====================

On the CPU front, the Fusion model is still based upon Intel's NUC platform. Fusion ioMemory has added PCIe Gen3 lanes, which allows the drive to use both the SATA and PCIe interfaces simultaneously. It is also said that Fusion ioMemory's SSD controller supports both Intel's Turbo Boost Max Technology 2.0 and 3.0 (a combination of PCIe 3.0 x8, SATA 6Gbps and NVMe 10Gbps) to allow the drive to use the best performance when the application demands it.

Performance

Our first evaluation of the Fusion ioMemory PX600 took place at its debut in October of last year, using a Samsung 950 Pro NVMe SSD. Although we did not extensively monitor the drive in daily use, it performed like most mainstream drives; a handful of 4K write operations over multiple days, followed by a handful of 4K read operations for a full week on the same NVMe SSD.

The Fusion ioMemory PX600 is designed to be fast. In an article by Anssi Vanjoki in TechReport last year, the data recovery and disaster recovery specialist demonstrated how fast its drive is for file transfers, comparing the performance of a traditional SSD vs the performance of its Fusion ioMemory drive.

The Fusion ioMemory Drive was able to transfer a 6.8GB PDF file at an impressive 1097MB/s and transfer a 7.1GB PDF file at 1,966MB/s. A 4K transfer from the 6.8GB PDF to the 7.1GB PDF occurred at an impressive 7,077MB/s and a 7.4GB image file from the 6.8GB PDF to the 7.2GB PDF occurred at 1,928MB/s.

In another test, Anssi was able to copy an 80GB hard drive boot sector containing a 15GB file to the Fusion disk in just 21 seconds. With an SSD, this was a time frame of just 1.5 seconds. When working with a larger file, the Fusion was able to complete the copy in 12.2 seconds and with file transfers greater than 3GB, it could do so in 8 seconds, the best of any of the SATA drives.

However, the performance levels don't come free. Fusion ioMemory advertises a 5-year warranty against failure, but the company admits to a 5-year warranty against data loss. This warranty does not apply to file failures. In our experience, a single SSD can reach its 5-year limit due to the higher cost of NAND compared to SSDs. In the end, Fusion ioMemory provides a much more reliable drive for an affordable price, but it is not without costs.

Capacity

One of the interesting aspects of the Fusion ioMemory PX600 family is how they are grouped by capacity. Starting at 1TB, the PX600 offers six 3.5" HDD options:

For the PX600's top capacity, Fusion ioMemory is continuing with the tradition of stacking 2.6TB drives in PX600-S configuration. The company offers two different capacities, with the lower capacity (2.6TB) in both the HDDs with a 256GB NVMe controller and the larger (2.7TB) drives with the standard 128GB controller.

The PX700 is the entry-level drive, offering just 1TB capacity. It is powered by Intel's NUC platform and features a 512GB mSSD chip which is able to boot with up to 4GB of cache, making speeds up to 560 MB/s faster than a mSSD-based PCIe SSD. Despite the low capacity, it still supports Xpoint, the Fusion ioMemory RAID

Unlike its predecessor, Fusion-io has made no changes to the original architecture, which is still utilizing 28nm FinFET technology and includes 4-channel read/write head for high performance. However, the new FPGA platform supports higher clockrates that are typically only achievable through higher clocked memory, like a PCIe Gen 3 x16 interface. According to Fusion-io, the new FPGA can go as high as 3.2GHz, but we're unaware of any detailed performance numbers for the new design.

The Fusion ioMemory SX300 is the new low cost enterprise-class MLC-less drive with 6Gbps SAS connectivity, SATA interface support, and a total drive capacity of 7.3TB. Although the PX600 and SX300 are both built on the same PX200 platform (the FHHL Fusion-io drive), the SX300 uses a new NAND die. Fusion-io lists the NAND die size as 40nm, although we can't say which NAND actually makes it into the PX600 and SX300.

The SX300 uses the same MLC flash from the larger PX600 and Fusion-io drives, which is essentially just the NAND. There is still dual-channel read/write heads, but we're curious to see how the FPGA performs under pressure. Fusion-io doesn't specify performance or die size, but we estimate that the SX300 will match or exceed the performance of the PX600, but may be limited by power efficiency, which the PX600 is designed to excel at.

As with a number of Fusion drives, Fusion-io has retained the proprietary PX200 controller, which has proven to be a very reliable controller across a variety of Fusion drives. The new controller supports SLC-based controllers and FPGAs, although a PCIe Gen 3 x4 interface is also supported. The new controller is optimized for the higher-end workload that Fusion-io delivers, so in many ways the SX300 and Fusion-io drives are closer to one another than a typical Fusion-io or PX600 would be.

All this talk about the Fusion-io drive family may lead many readers to believe that there will be more Fusion drives coming in the future. As far as the Fusion-io product line goes, the only addition (based on Fusion IO's press release) is the PX600. That means that Fusion-io will launch its next-generation Fusion NAND drives, possibly within the next month-three months. We'll do our best to get news as soon as we can.

The 'Poker Face' singer also reveals she was forced into rehab by the 'Bad Romance' singer when their relationship ended in 2008, and writes candidly that she didn't want to go, but the "love in [her] heart led me to stay."

But the relationship apparently wasn't always successful, and in her memoir 'Joan Rivers: The Autobiography', Gaga acknowledges her fears that, rather than being strong "enough" to survive, the relationship would just have "ruined our relationship" entirely.

"In fact, the relationship could've only ruined our friendship, which has always been at its best when neither one of us feels like we have to sacrifice. I could've fallen off of the wagon – and I did in

In an ideal world, the drive can be paired across PCIe 2.0 x8 and the new Fusion ioMemory X10/21 interfaces that connect to the IOzone MIO APFC. The ioRAM X10/21 is an all-flash configuration and the Fusion IOzone mio accelerator stack provides the necessary DRAM and I/O control logic to drive all the needed DRAM and I/O. The ioRAM X10/21 in the PX600 and SX300 is a 4-channel configuration, while the PX600 supports x8, x16 and x32. Each of these interfaces allows for a total of 10 Gbps of throughput, which puts Fusion on par with 2.5TB SAS SSDs.

In practical terms, Fusion-io's Fusion-io XP8-A and Fusion-io X10-Z1 series of drives have been built using the same Fusion ioRAM X10-Z1 and ioRAM X10/21 interfaces, which allows for the PX600 and SX300 to be configured from the same chassis. There is a significant number of firmware updates and the Fusion-io X10/21 interface can be adapted by using the MIO APFC. This enables an option to pair Fusion-io XP8-A and XP10-A (and XP/X2-Z1 and X10/21) drives. Both XP8-A and XP10-A come with one Fusion IOZone MIO APFC and one of the ioMemory PX600. That means it's possible to take four drive units and run four Fusion-io XP8-A or XP10-A drives. The XP8-A and XP10-A are also compatible with each other, with an ioRAM X10/21 interface to connect to Fusion ioMemory S/MIO APFC and the SX300.

On the storage side, Fusion-io is using LSI SAS SAS-S300-24GB. These have four SATA interfaces with a pair of PATA interfaces, with SAS-S300-24GB-E offering a SATA-III host bus. As the SAS-S300-24GB family is in its peak of availability currently, we suspect that these may be the last SAS drives in these lines before the new XP9100 SSDs become available. For those who need a faster interface, LSI SAS SAS-S300-64GB is also part of the series, offering four SATA interfaces with a pair of PATA interfaces.<|endoftext|>Bud Budman of the National Weather Service in Norman, Okla., said there are four main reasons for the temperature in the area to be so high Sunday.<|endoftext|>This article is from the archive of our partner .

President Obama's campaign released its final fundraising numbers Monday morning, just hours before Election Day, and the race is tightening. Both the Obama and Romney campaigns raised $110 million from contributions during the month of October, and just $80 million went to Obama, compared with $70 million for Romney. But while the Romney campaign is taking a huge hit, Obama's team is taking a massive hit. It lost $19 million to outside groups, or as an administration official says, the "donors" to the Romney campaign.

What's more, the campaign's independent expenditures -- its spending that isn't connected with political parties -- were so out of whack with its fundraising that it was more than 80 percent behind in all of its spending and a full $30 million ahead in debt. In other words, Obama's campaign is spending every dollar it does bring in and using that money to pay for all the consultants it needs just to keep the campaign humming along. As a result, Obama took in $8 million

While Intel's 4.5" Fusion IO devices have seen little change over the years due to a proprietary controller design, Fusion (and IO) is constantly evolving. Fusion-io is continually testing their IO hardware, firmware and software to ensure the optimal Fusion hardware configuration. That means there will be drivers available for a large number of IO workloads.

Atomic offers no change in the IO architecture for Fusion IO. The IO configuration is the same across the board. The PX600 and SX300 are based off a standard Fusion IO controller, with the IO performance in the two units being comparable, but the IO and firmware configuration differs depending on the capacity being offered.

As with all Fusion IO, all the controller blocks are software-assigned to the IO devices, so a different controller in a Fusion IO SSD would require the firmware to change. There is no native way for the SSD to read or write a custom firmware, leaving that up to the system builder to develop.

While Intel only uses the standard Fusion IO controller, Fusion IO drives can also be used with the non-standard Intel PX-2 controller that powers their SSDs. PX2 offers the same performance and capacity improvements as the Fusion IO controller (both of which are integrated into a smaller NAND die) - but only in the form of integrated controllers.

To accommodate the larger die and the PX-2 controller, the PX600 and SX300 use a modified controller controller which uses a second NAND die. Intel uses a single controller chip per drive (which Intel calls a "PCIe controller"), but they have decided to replace that chip with two NAND die based controllers. The two NAND die die can't be shared, although they can be shared between two different drives. For some capacities, the two NAND die must be the same size. For the 2.6TB capacity and higher, the single NAND die can't be shared. The two NAND dies are connected in a dual channel configuration, but not all Intel drives use dual channel IO, with the older 6G SSDs using single channel IO and the P3 and P4 drives with a single channel IO as well.

The PX600 is currently available in a variety of capacities, but for 2.6TB capacity and higher we can only look forward to seeing the PX600 in 8G capacities.

The new Fusion IO line is available today, starting at 8G:

PX600: 8G (240GB, 240GB, 360GB, 480GB and 960GB) PX600e: 16G (480GB, 960GB)

The town appears on the old Serbian coins that have been found in Serbia that are older than this. The first village in the village of Botoš (3,376 inhabitants in 2002), which was annexed to the city in 1777, was known as Drenjan. The name was changed in 1474 from Drenjanu to Vranjsko Botoš (1,879 residents), thus forming the village of Vranjc. A town called "Vranija" was incorporated under the region of "Vranja" in the 15th century. It was known by that name on the coins found in Serbia, on which the first name of the village is "Vranija." Later it was also known as Vranje (1,095 inhabitants), which was changed again, in 1558, into Vranja.

Village of Nis (1,634 inhabitants in 2002) was originally named Novi Sad (6,737 residents) by a grant of land by King Vladislav I (1380-1391). The grant was dated May 6, 1380, in the year when Nis had only 814 inhabitants. The original population of the village was probably around 10,000 in 1380. In 1559 the town of Nis got a permanent name, Nisija, and became the capital of the province Novi Sad, but in 1566 the city of Nis was annexed by Belgrade for the purpose of constructing the new city of Novi Sad, with two adjacent villages, in the territory of Kordunica Kavršana, named after the Russian prince, and in which the present city of Nis now stands.

The first name of the village, known from old documents as Novi Sad (6,737 residents) was probably derived from a local name meaning "the city of Novi Sad" (1,966 inh.), which, under the influence of the Russian-Ottoman Empire from 1202 to 1396, was called Novi Sadkovo (2,137 inh.), in 1397 the village was united by the grant of Koman Sovetovac, which gave Belgrade the right to call it Nis (6,737 inhabitants) and its town to be Nisija (1,634 inhabitants), and, as well as the region named Kordunica Kavršana.

In 1403 Nis was united into the village of Nisijik (5,086 inhabitants), which was annexed to Belgrade and became Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, in 1914. The name was changed later to Novi Sad Kocir

Although we are aware of the fact that in the 12th century the municipality started to develop into the large town Vjakobovac, we are quite certain that until the arrival of the Turks in 1291 the name Vojvodina does not mean anything in the Serbian language. The name of town was adopted at a later date.

From a Serbian viewpoint, the municipality of Zrenjanin is known as the first town on Bosnia and Herzegovina. The town is not the only historical landmark on the western border of the province of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The town of Ljevićen in the municipality of Ljevki was founded in 1272 and was destroyed in the 16th century. Both the municipality of Ljevki and the town of Zrenjanin are part of the province of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their area is 1,280 km².

The town of Tomaševac is named after a nearby medieval town (tomaš), the name being derived from tomaz, the German word for 'fort'. The town of Tomaševac and the municipality of Tomaševac are both situated in the province of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Tomaševac is 1,054 km². The municipalities of Banatovićevo and Mihajlovo are part of the region of Sarajevo and are 1,868 km². Banatovićevo and Mihajlovo have different names in the Serbian language; Banatovićevo is a village which was founded in 1643, while Mihajlovo was founded in 1707.

The Chinese government has refused an "unprecedented" request from President Xi Jinping for Chinese hacker Guo Wengui to leave the US, state media say.

Guo went missing on Saturday with a business partner after a row over his activities in the US.

He is accused of spying.

It is an unusual development as Mr Xi has sought to promote closer ties with the US, and has met President Donald Trump over the weekend.

Mr Guo was last seen in the US state of Missouri, when he and Mr Xu went missing.

On Tuesday, his wife said, he told a Chinese police officer that Mr Xu was dead after a "physical fight". Mr Guo apparently then vanished with his business partner, Chen.

Speaking to reporters in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said that China had denied Mr Xi's "unprecedented" demand because the United States had not provided evidence of Mr Guo's crime.

He added China has been "very sensitive" to cases of internet freedom and "will not compromise on this issue".

Guo's mother, Chen Xiaolu, said on Wednesday: "Guo is still in the US. China wants him and the investigation to continue."<|endoftext|>This is an article by Chris "Pooka" Hagen that gives a detailed run down of my setup in a dual boot with Windows 7 and Ubuntu

The municipality of Zrenjanin is made of the town of Zrenjanin proper (79,773 inhabitants in 2002) and of the villages of Aradac (3,461 inh.), Banatski Despotovac (1,823 inh.), Belo Blato (1,477 inh.), Botoš (2,436 inh.), Elemir (4,734 inh.), Ečka (5,172 inh.), Jankov Most (752 inh.), Klek (2,959 inh.), Knićanin (2,034 inh.), Lazarevo (3,308 inh.), Lukino Selo (598 inh.), Lukićevo (2,077 inh.), Melenic (6,737 inh.), Mihajlovo (1,004 inh.), Orlovat (1,789 inh.), Perlez (3,818 inh.), Stajićevo (1,999 inh.), Taraš (1,140 inhabitants), Tomaševac (1,765 inh.), Farkaždin (1,386 inh.) and Šenta (3,119 inh.).

The first name of the town, known
==================== COMPLETION 119 ====================
 even before 1330, is unknown. The surname Zrenjanin was first recorded about 1330 in a document signed by Joáš Javoršić and dated to between 1343 and 1345. The first place of residence for the town was the Hlaska (today's "Žaždovo"), where it was settled for about a century, although it was probably built elsewhere first and then settled there. About 1610 it is mentioned several times in the local documents. The town was named in 1590 and 1618, respectively.

From the 1660s the town was occupied by the municipality of Banatski Despotovac. At that time a population of over 7,000 people lived in the town with its various hamlets. In 1868, the municipality of Zrenjanin was created with several new structures, which made the area even more densely populated. About the same time a railway was built to bring coal and water to the town. The railway was closed in 1924 and the town had only three train stations, and not more than 30 passenger cars were available when the railway was shut down. The town had its own coal-burning power plant in 1951 and was then supplied from Belgrade by the Belgrade-Vojvodina railway.

During the war the railway was taken over by the Red Army and destroyed, but some local railway shops were managed by the Germans – "Niedieckische Kinematographisches Werkstätten", "Konsuppe der Wirtschaftsschwulstung", "Arbeitstahlwerkkreis GmbH" and many others. These shops were then confiscated by the Soviet Army, however these are no longer in use.

In 1944, the war ended, and Yugoslavia had to pay compensation for all the economic losses incurred during fighting. Yugoslavia took no significant part in that war, and the town became a part of Serbia. In 1945 it was officially recognised by the UNSC.

During the war more than 20,000 people were killed and the town suffered more than 200,000 casualties. The Soviet occupation was followed by the occupation by Milosevic in 1996 and again in 1999.

In 2006, however, the municipality of Zrenjanin formally declared its intention to start developing the town's tourist potential. In that year the town got a new name, which was incorporated at the invitation of the mayor of Belgrade and the Zrenjanin municipality: Botoš. In 2017, a new bridge connected the towns of Zrenjanin and Belo Blato.

Visas

Zrenjanin has a visa policy according to the Visa Directive of 20 May 2001. All applicants who hold a Schengen passport should apply for a visa at the consulate of Belgrade before arrival.

This may be done in person if it is not possible to visit in the mail. To apply for a visa from Zrenjanin, applicants must present a passport, an original certificate of the Schengen visa or a recent letter from a friend or relatives abroad, signed by two witnesses.

An applicant not holding a Schengen visa will therefore have to obtain a visa from the Austrian consulate in Belgrade at a later time.

Stay safe

According to the latest crime statistics, Zrenjanin as a whole saw a total drop in recorded crime numbers (from 2,611 recorded crimes in 2010 to 2,361 in 2016).

All the data presented here refer to Zrenjanin. For other parts of Serbia, the following rates are reported:

This is not actually the most famous town in Zrenjanin, which is the one which can best be called the capital of Serbia. That one is the town of Velika Sarajevo (Veliko Sarajevo in English). The town of Treskavu or "The River" comes from Zrenjanin, the Serbian form, which actually means just "River". Zrenjanin means "the River" in English. The first name of the town, known for centuries as Treskavu, comes from Đerbatan Zrenjanin and means "Tresco" in Esperanto. As Tresco is in fact a river, the town of Treska is not the capital of Treska, the capital of the country and the county in which the town is located.

The town of Velika is a beautiful town, with several streets to choose from and a pleasant atmosphere. There are a lot of bars in Velika, and it is a pretty touristy town.

Velika is in fact located in the Serbo-Croatian countryside, close to the country's borders with Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The town had a major population back in the 16th century, when it held a royal court. The castle, in the middle of the city square, was rebuilt between 1848 and 1890 on top of an ancient fort.

Treskavu is located only about 40 km from Belgrade and about 160 km from Sarajevo. There is no modern train connection, so you have to take a bus (from Treskavu to Belgrade can take up to 2 hours, and from Belgrade to Sarajevo can take another 2-3 hours). The nearest airport to Treskavu is Kotor.

 rape, with two very similar pictures at www.culture-crop.com (right, next to crop circle). Both pictures show the same crop circle at Golden Ball Hill at the beginning and end of a crop season, but on a far larger scale than in the picture of this essay. The crop-circle picture above is at Golden Ball Hill, and the picture below is at Bishambagh. The difference between the two is clearly seen from the differences in the shapes of the various crop-stalks within the crop-circle: The wheat plant-stem pictured to the left has a single outer stamens and a single inner stamen, as depicted by the grain-stalk in the crop-circle photo shown to the right. In the picture to the right, the large wheat plant and flower-stalks are shown with a double core. Each of the six plant-stalks has a central stalk surrounded by 6 smaller stalks, one for each of the six flowers. The photo on the left shows different plants or flowers for each of the 6 types of stalks within the crop-stalk. In the picture on the right, we see a single, inner stamen at the base of each of the single stalks, and a single outer stamen at the top of each of the single plants. At each node between the inner and outer stamens, two new plant-stalks are inserted: one with a new inner stamen, and one without a new inner stamen, each with a new outer stamen (see photo of same crop circle above). Each stamenic has a single, distinct core (not a double-cored staminic), and the inner-stamen bears 6 stamens. The outer-stamen bears 3 stamens. This difference in the stamens of inner and outer staminic is visible in both of this example crop pictures. The outer staminic in each of these two grain-stalks is also shown in the photo immediately above. It is also shown in a crop-stalks picture from the Netherlands, at www.science-crop.com

A wheat stalk, which is a single, inner stamen The inner stamen or core of the wheat stamens in any grain-stalks crop are clearly visible in this example picture (which is from a different location and date): The grain-stalks shown here in these two pictures are both from the same location, and date to the same time. The wheat stalk shown to the left has a single deep core, as compared with the shallow core seen in the stamens shown to the right. Why are the wheat stalk cores of these crops so unlike each other? Is there a difference in the energies in wheat that cause these differences? See the Crop-Circles and Wheat at Golden Ball Hill (June 26, 2005) on the www.culture-crop.com website, which clearly shows a stamene-stalk cluster. Note that the stamene core of each of these stamens in this grain-stalk cluster is much thicker than the corresponding outer core, and the stamene core in each of these stamens can be easily seen to extend out to the outer surface of the stamens. This is clearly seen in a crop-stalks image taken in Bishambagh, Iraq, at www.science-crop.com. A grain-stalk cluster also indicates that there is a double-stalk or core within the individual stamens within each of these grain-stalks in both these examples photos. The double-core within the same stamene in each of these two pictures is easily seen: The double core within a stamene in any

 rape: (see www.culture-crop.com or cropcircle.net). This picture shows a crop circle at a farm near Pilsen, Mexico. The "witches" in this crop circle are clearly visible. One wonders whether they were actually standing in water in the center of the circle, in the form of a shallow pool! Why do "witches" show up in all fields? The answer is simple: the crop circle is a "spontaneous event", a "coincidence", as they have written it, when there are no "witches" around. (See my interview with Mike Shroder, here.) In short, the presence of "witches" in a crop circle must be explained in terms of the energies and fields of the crop. Is "witching" in the fields a good explanation? We cannot answer this question with any confidence, for the "witches" in our crop circle pictures are either on the side of good intentions, or are "bad apples" like the ones in the above crop. There is no middle ground for these pictures. However, it would be interesting to have a comparison of an oilseed rape crop circle at Golden Ball Hill versus a wheat crop circle at Pilsen, Mexico, or an oilseed rape crop circle at Pilsen versus a wheat crop circle at Pilsen or Pilsen versus Mexico. How to tell if a crop circle is a "normal" crop circle. At Golden Ball Hill, on May 1, 2005, a man approached me on his bicycle and asked how to find Golden Ball Hill as mentioned by Dr. Peter L. Johnson in a report: A crop circle at Golden Ball Hill, Wiltshire, May 1, 2005, was visible to the eye in the early morning (1-5AM) at the north-east point of the circle. I took two pictures of the crop circle. In the first picture taken at the end of the day, the entire circle, including the central circle, was visible. In the second picture (5:15AM) it appears only the central circle was visible. In his report to the press, Johnson writes that "a number of crop-circle experts [were] present at the site to provide their opinion... The most serious of these was British author, Peter Johnson from Oxford University; the second was American professor of physics, Matin Durrani from University of Wisconsin, Madison, and the third was a local police officer from Pilsen". However, from the following information, one would not be able to tell where such experts have been: 1. Johnson's report to the press stated he contacted two specialist crop circle investigators and asked them to see the field of Golden Ball Hill. None of them were present. The field of Golden Ball Hill is far from visible from the road. It should therefore be easier to visit the site by car. 2. In his report to the press, Johnson also mentions that the sun had partially set when he took the pictures. How is it possible that he is able to take photos at sunset? 3. According to the information provided by the crop circle investigators, their photographs were taken during the first two days, but no time-of-day information was provided in their letter of July 17, 2005 to the Press. This would be a very un-progressive way of dealing with the problem. If the crop circle is in a field, then how do you take pictures at sunset in an ordinary field with sunburned photographers at hand, at 5:15 AM, as shown below? 4. Even Johnson admits "The field is in a semi-rural or 'unplanned' area, with access difficult, even for a first-timer". Is it not fair to assume the field

 rape. An interesting experiment in plant stem flexibility was performed at the University of Arizona in Tucson in 2004 by R.T. Schlechter, Ph.D. A stem of wheat with a diameter up to about 1.2 meters was stretched about five to eight meters. The stems were cut into small pieces, held by wire from the outside, and were rolled down a hill. The stems did not snap, but only stretched slightly on the way to the bottom of the hill. A similar experiment was performed at the University of Illinois of Urbana-Champaign, the experiments were shown on video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yw5F2c4YxU (see also http://www.culture-crop.com, and some more related work). The video and pictures and more information about this can be found at http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v13/n6/full/ncomms1329.html and also at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEuO-W1sJ5w.

A picture of oilseed rape plants in the field with wire supports in the background is shown at left. The photo was taken in a crop season at the end of 2003 of a crop season of late wheat, mid-ripen oilseed rape and sown sunflower, and is taken from a crop protection photo set at the University of Illinois of Urbana Champaign. The photo above is from the photo set. Also note the long wire supports that were used. Here are some more photos from this crop season and other sites showing the fine stretch and stretch-over-bend of oilseed rape during late spring and early summer 2004. It does not look as if any stress is being applied that would result in a snapping. The stems do not snap in this case, although the plants are not really being bent.

Some of the stem bending is shown at right. This illustration is also from the photo set at the University of Illinois of Urbana-Champaign. We can even see how the stems are bent over, but the bend does not extend very far. Some stretch does occur, although the plant does not seem stressed. The point is that the stem does not seem to be stressed, but does stretch to the point of an "overshoot." When these stems are exposed to normal stresses, then the bending appears.

An illustration of water-drip irrigation to keep plant stems in normal shape is shown at left. This illustration was taken at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock under the direction of J.K. McWilliams, M.S.I. Here, water is placed in a tube to be applied at high pressure. The high pressure in this case is to reduce the plant growth, so that it will be easier to bend and stretch these stems that are being kept in a flat or somewhat vertical position.

Some oilseed rape plants are shown at right with their stems bent or stretched. These are from the University of Illinois of Urbana Champaign, and the illustrations were taken at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. For more information see other crop photo sets related to water-drip irrigation for oilseed rape from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock by J.K.

 rape. It is called "Dune", and we first show a photo of it. It is a good example of the kind of image in which a grain-size grain of rock would appear if we photographed it using a camera with a light sensor. The rock pictured above is actually a rock of gold grain size, and it will probably be a very large grain size to produce any effects such as flattening or cracking. At any rate, when we try to make an image, we must first make sure that there are no obstructions or shadows to prevent us from seeing what we are trying to represent. By comparison, here are photos of small rocks, grains and soil. The photo of the Dune rock shows it as clearly as can be done. At the top, the photograph is taken in light from a bright light source (a tungsten filament) at a temperature of 3000k. Below, the photograph is taken in light from the sun, at a high enough temperature (about 6000C) to allow it to lighten by about half a degree in temperature. This is a picture taken with the Nikon D2X, with a very large lens, at a time where the D2X does not lighten the image by this large degree at all, but at least allows us to see it. The photographer is Bill Steig and the camera is the D1c, with a very wide angle lens, at a time when the D1c does not lighten the image by that wide degree either. (see photo of Steig taken by Steve Shroder below) So, we are very much in the situation like the photographer. Now we turn to the oilseed rape photo. First, we must find a low temperature, relatively high-resolution, photo - a picture where the camera cannot lighten the image due to any light being in the photograph. It was very important to Steve Shroder (see his site) to ensure that there were no shadows or distractions in the picture so that he could make a nice detailed photo. Steve also took a number of measurements of the position of the wheat plant, so that he would know the position of the plant on that particular day, given the photograph. Because the grain size in the photograph was so large, it is very difficult to take detailed photographs, even with very narrow aperture-size lenses, such as that used by Steve. In order to produce an accurate photograph of any picture, these two features must be avoided at all costs. The photo of the Dune rock above is a close replica of the image created with a Nikon D1c camera, at a much higher-resolution than that in the photo made above. This photo was photographed by Bill Steig and this is the photo of the Dune rock. By contrast, the photograph taken of the wheat plant can be made accurate, by using a very wide-angle lens, using a light source close to the wheat plant and using a much lower-resolution camera such as the Nikon D2X in a very bright light source. This is the photo of a wheat plant on its field, where the grain size is just about 3 mm in diameter. By contrast, the photograph of the Dune rock can be made accurate, if we use a much larger-format lens, with a very fast sensor, such as that used by a Nikon D4, used at a much higher-resolution than that used in the photo of the wheat plant. This photo was made with a Nikon D4D and can be seen below. By contrast, the photograph of the wheat plant can hardly be made accurate, given the grain size being just under 3 mm in diameter. This is the photograph of a wheat seedling, photographed using an 18 megapixel Nikon D200 camera. The above photograph

Sony Xperia Z3 360-degree view

The Sony Xperia Z3 stands at 146 x 72 x 7.3 mm, which is somewhat more compact and notably slimmer than its Xperia Z2 predecessor (146.8 x 73.3 x 8.2 mm). However, the bezels around the screen have been reduced somewhat more than the raw number difference suggests as the new flagship has rounded edges, which normally add to the overall footprint.

Still, if you compare the Xperia Z3 to a couple of its direct rivals - the Galaxy S5 and HTC One (M8), you immediately notice that it's a larger, if slimmer device. The difference to the One (M8) is easily offset by the slimmer waistline (not to mention that's it's made up for by the larger screen), but the Samsung handset does feel more compact.

In terms of size, its only slight rival is the G3, a device which feels very small and flimsy compared to its flagship Android counterpart.


Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime G4 vs. Sony Xperia Z3

The front of the Xperia Z3 measures 6.9mm, which is almost precisely that of the HTC One (M8) and about a millimeter thinner than the Samsung Galaxy S5, though it's still thicker than Sony's best-selling Xperia phone, the Xperia Z1 (which measures 6.0mm). However, Sony has also shaved off a fraction from the Xperia Z1's front bezel, giving it a much more pleasant view on the front. The back covers roughly the same area (6.9mm).

On the right of the front there's a home button with a dual-SIM tray at the bottom. For the second SIM, the rear of the phone will be charged with the microUSB port, but for the third SIM - if you're using any 4G-capable card - the SIM tray and SIM card slot will be occupied by the third SIM slot on the next to the camera at the top, which is actually a memory card slot.

There's not much to talk about the sides and bottom as the Xperia Z3 is basically unchanged from the Xperia Z2. The power button has a subtle LED flash, although the volume rocker is on the left side of the phone. There's a fingerprint scanner on the rear. The Xperia Z1 is a little bigger than Sony's previous flagship, but it has the same resolution as the Z3, 4.6" IPS LCD screen, with 1920 × 1080 pixels, which is actually not enough for its 720p screen.

Sony Xperia Z3 versus HTC One (M8) and Galaxy S5

The front and rear panels have been changed slightly on both the Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3 Compact, with two LED flashes (up from one on the Z2 and one on the Z3). The front is where you would expect to find the front-facing camera, which is slightly more compact this time around, measuring 8.1% larger in diameter.

The Xperia Z3 (and Z3 Compact) also feature front-facing stereo speakers, placed just above and directly above the earpiece, just behind the volume rocker and right above the microphone. The Xperia Z2 feature a mono speaker arrangement which only allows for the left, right and centre ports to be used.


Sony Xperia Z3 versus Samsung Galaxy S5

The Xperia Z3 is slightly bigger in diameter, but also slightly heavier. It weighs 162 grams (5.78 oz), compared to 145 grams (5.59 oz) on the Xperia Z2 and 143 grams (5.36 oz) on the Z3 Compact. It's also thicker, by 0.2 mm (0.09 in) compared to 0.2 mm (0.09 in) on the Z2 and Z3.


Sony Xperia Z3 versus HTC One (M8) compared with Galaxy S5

On the front you'll find the microUSB port, a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack and the front-facing camera. The Xperia Z3 features two LED flashes: one for the front-facing camera with the flash LED off, and the other for the rear camera. The back contains the standard MicroUSB port and the 3.5mm port.

Overall, the Xperia Z3 is a substantial chunk of metal along with a thick aluminium trim which acts as a metal frame in the back of the phone and adds to the strength, making it a little harder to hold the device firmly.

In terms of dimensions, the Xperia Z3 measures 146 x 72.5 x 8.2 mm, which is taller by 0.7 mm than the Xperia Z2 (124.2 x 77.5 x 8.5 mm) and thinner by 0.3 mm. So is it the most compact flagship Sony has produced? Well, probably not. The Z1 Compact was more comparable when it had 4.6-inch screen and 1,920 x 1,080 resolution but it was a far more compact device itself.


The Sony Xperia Z3 measures in at 129.5 x 65.5 x 8 mm. Which means it's more compact, but also less powerful

In terms of weight the Xperia Z3 is 10 grams heavier than its predecessor but not by much, at 1.1 ounces heavier overall. As we mentioned earlier, a thicker body will increase the resistance, but still it's a very good all-rounder, especially considering the price.

The Sony Xperia Z3 does not take full advantage of the extra space by going all-out and adding an additional speaker grill inside the Xperia Z3's casing.

Another difference between the Xperia Z3 and Z2 is in the camera area. The Xperia Z3 features a 10-megapixel Sony IMX298 sensor which is a more powerful version of its predecessor. And its pixel count has increased.


The Sony Xperia Z3 camera software sports new features, like 4K video and auto-focus

In the front, the Xperia Z3 takes advantage of the fact that it features the same size as its predecessor's 4.6-inch screen by having a 1.6-inch IPS LCD. But that's where the similarity stops, as the front camera has slightly higher resolutions than its predecessor. Sony has reduced the pixel count to 1,080 x 1,920 so it can now offer the same pixel count as the Galaxy S5 with its 1,920 x 1,080 screen.<|endoftext|>By Jonathan Gault

January 25 – A new study by the Institute of Sports Nutrition – the world's largest sports nutrition organization – has found that a majority of the professional footballers in the world, who represent more than 80 percent of the world's national team players, suffer from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

CTE has been attributed many times in the past to various sports, including football, and has been strongly linked to repetitive brain injuries. Many studies have examined the relationship between CTE and football, and have found it to be a strong and reliable indicator of brain damage.

To find out if the players in football suffered from CTE, the IosN analysed data on 894 former professional footballers from 40-plus nations for 11 years (1999-2010), and on 532 retired professional American hockey players, who retired between 2000 and 2011, before being replaced by junior players. All information was compiled by experts at the International Institute for Sports Nutrition.

The study shows that in the vast majority of cases in which players suffered from CTE, the former professional football, and the professional American hockey players were not involved in contact sports.

The new study is an update of research that was published in 2007, and showed a very high frequency rate of CTE in professional footballers who were not involved in contact sports. In this update of the 2007 finding, a larger number of former

Sony Xperia Z3 360-degree view

The Sony Xperia Z3 stands at 146 x 72 x 7.3 mm, which is somewhat more compact and notably slimmer than its Xperia Z2 predecessor (146.8 x 73.3 x 8.2 mm). However, the bezels around the screen have been reduced somewhat more than the raw number difference suggests as the new flagship has rounded edges, which normally add to the overall footprint.

Still, if you compare the Xperia Z3 to a couple of its direct rivals - the Galaxy S5 and HTC One (M8), you immediately notice that it's a larger, if slimmer device. The difference to the One (M8) is easily offset by the slimmer waistline (not to mention that's it's made up for by the larger screen), but the Samsung handset does feel more compact.

The Xperia Z4 looks even smaller than the new Xperia Z3 Compact with the screen size even smaller at the base compared to the Z3. The camera bump on the Xperia Z3 compact (which also helps support the glass back) is almost non-existent but still visible to the naked eye. There's no longer a Micro HDMI port either, and there isn't a Micro USB or USB type-C port either, although you can use the Xperia Z3 to charge a mobile device up to 90%.


The front on the Xperia Z4 and Xperia Z3 Compact (left + right)

Overall, the Xperia Z3 has been redesigned again

Sony was very clear about its thinking behind the new Xperia Z3 design, saying the devices were designed to "showcase the Xperia Z4 and Xperia Z3 Compact' features that make their way to the flagship product," although it did add further explanation saying the two phones were designed with a view to future mobile devices, as an example of the company's "customised designs that can be used with other devices", such as the Xperia Z3 or Z3 Compact.

The Sony Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3 Compact sizes compared - back and front


One big change in the Xperia Z3 and the Z3 Compact is the removal of the IP-rating. This isn't a huge change but more than 3 million Xperia Z3 units were sold so there'd sure be some complaining the company doesn't support its flagship handsets on more recent devices. We'll have to wait and see how many complain about it as the Xperia Z4 may have a similar update waiting for it out the box.

The Z3 and Z3 Compact features have also been tweaked with the Z3 still featuring a 5-inch Full HD display on the front and the Z3 Compact now sporting a smaller 4.6-inch display at the back. The new devices also have Sony's Duo camera (a 12-megapixel rear and 8-megapixel front) and a 1.5 GHz quad-core processor. The display is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 801.

As we mentioned earlier, the Xperia Z3 and Z3 compact are a few millimetres thinner than the original Xperia Z3 but still have the same footprint - 146 x 72 x 7.3mm. The Xperia Z4 adds even more bulk, including a 2,500 mAh battery. It's a similar weight to the Xperia Z3 and larger than the Xperia Z2, which can't be that much of an issue since it now has a screen that's slightly larger.

A few of the many stories of the British Army during WWI are that of this. In the first year of the war (1914), the infantry were forced the surrender of Paris and were retreating towards the French capital. The men were desperate and on the lookout. The troops were not to be defeated, but to be kept alive. They must make their last charge, but in a day where any attempt of the French to retake the area in which the surrender was taken would be considered suicidal, the command was able to hold the line well. Many were injured, and those that survived, with some of the most valiant of them refusing to give up the fight, were able to escape into the country. Others took refuge in

Sony has added a 3,200mAh non-removable battery to its flagship along with a fingerprint scanner that can detect finger prints on a 5.2-inch OLED screen. The Z3 does support Sony's own MHL 2.0 smartphone standard.


The Xperia Z3 camera app (left) and the new Samsung Galaxy S5 camera app

You'll be able to download Sony's SmartConnect software which acts just as a remote control and camera app to get the best shooting experience from the smartphone. The SmartConnect app integrates Google Earth's location-tracking capabilities to display current locations of all the Z series' pictures and video in an interactive display along with the corresponding date and time of the photo and video taken. Sony also adds its own interactive camera features to the smartphone.

The Z3 does also receive an upgraded camera software that supports the following modes:

Auto & Manual (both are available in single shooting mode),

Stills (which can be adjusted while the picture is taking),

HDR,

Panorama (with the option to add watermarks),

Vimeo (with support for video recording),

SDR (supports up to 5.1- or 5.7-channel), and

4K Video recording.

The Sony Xperia Z3 gets an upgrade in terms of video recording capabilities over its first-generation predecessor. It features 20-megapixels of resolution, which is quite substantial for a smartphone, as well as 1080p30 video recording capabilities. Also, the recording quality of 720p video recording has been enhanced to deliver better image quality, according to Sony.


As we can see the Sony Xperia Z3 camera is capable of recording 1080p30 video at 60fps

The Xperia Z3 also comes with support to use high-res MHL-compatible accessories like a mini projector.

The Xperia Z3 has been certified by the Federal Communications Commission and FCC (Federal Communications Commission) as a Wireless Access Category 4 (WCDMA) device.

Yet we are obliged to use the full force of our political and legal authority to protect vulnerable groups from imminent threats of violence.

At the end of World War II, the United States government undertook a long-term program of creating, training, and equipping a "safe" force — specially trained special operations forces — for the defense of Western Europe. For several decades, these forces were trained throughout the world, first at the United States Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Quantico, Virginia, and later at Camp Pendleton, California.

Today, the United States has more special operations forces in Europe than at any time in its history. We are also operating these forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet, over the past six months there have been only a few reported serious incidents involving U.S. special operations forces in Europe. The Department of Defense reports that U.S. special operations forces have been involved in only one or two small-scale incidents at the margins of their mission to train and advise the host nation military.

In addition to training and advising, special operations forces are also involved in supporting other missions of the military, such as training, advising, and assisting in operations against drug trafficking, irregular warfare, counter-piracy, homeland security, and other major defense commitments.

Rogers' Fido offers the same phone deal for more — $95 a month in most provinces.

But both companies charge only $48 a month for the same cellphone package in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, where the telecoms face more competition. Kijiji in Toronto is crawling with ads for cheap $48 cellphone plans that should cost close to double that amount with major carriers. (Plans by Joe)

The theory is, somehow these third-party dealers secure the cheaper phone plan out of Saskatchewan or Manitoba and then switch over a customer's phone number from another province.

As compensation, dealers ask for a one-time set-up fee ranging from $40 to $150.

Last year, CBC News brought you a story about the cheap underground cellular industry. At the time, the ads we highlighted had disappeared and telecom Telus said it was looking into the practice.

But almost a year later, advertisements for these $48 plans abound on the internet, targeted at customers outside Manitoba and Saskatchewan. And those involved tell CBC News that business is thriving.

Gary Ng, editor of the tech site iPhone in Canada, believes high cellular service prices in most provinces are helping fuel an underground business.

The cost of cell phone service in my province is a huge hurdle to entry for a person who wants to become mobile telecommunications entrepreneur," he said.

A phone plan can cost from $48 (in Manitoba) to $240 (in Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for service from a third-party dealer. (CBC)

Ng, a self-described "early adopter" of mobile technology, says consumers are used to paying a few dollars more to get better service.

"I was an early adopter of high-speed broadband Internet service when I was a teen," he said.

But he says cellphone service remains "cheap relative to a broadband broadband Internet plan because there are basically many more phones," he said.

"That said, for the cost of a cell phone plan from Telus it's actually cheaper than from the cellphone carriers or from a landline-only internet service plan from a big provider," Ng said.

A new study by the Telecommunications Research Center found some cellphone providers in the Prairie provinces now ask customers to switch carriers to get cheaper plans than what they can get from the big guys in the capital region.

CBC News investigated claims some cellphone dealers are offering cheaper plans in Saskatchewan using the Canadian Federation of Independent Telephone Companies' data.

A SaskTel employee says the $48 plan from a third-party dealer is the best deal for consumers. (CBC)

As part of our investigation, we discovered the same tactics have been used in other provinces to charge consumers less money to use their mobile phones.

While Ontario has the highest cellphone usage rate per year among consumer provinces, it's the same as the least expensive plan that a dealer offers in Saskatchewan — $48 in Manitoba and Ontario that has a set-up fee ranging from $40 to $150. (In Saskatchewan, customers of the SaskTel-owned Sasktel Mobile offer the cheapest plan at $26.25.)

In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the dealers do not want to say they are selling the cheapest plan for one reason: Customers are not willing to pay the higher cost.

Rogers spokesperson David Madden said they are "deeply disappointed" by CBC's findings.

"We have contacted Kijiji and will be contacting every single one of our 1,600 SaskTel mobile customers, as well as every individual that has been in contact with Kijiji that we have found selling cell phone plans," he said.

Rogers has no information to confirm if they are also working on the problem.

"There is no evidence of our involvement or involvement with any of Kijiji's vendors and we are looking into the issue."

While the ads for the $48 plans persist online, Winnipeg-based Kijiji does not advertise cellphone deals on its site and said "if we find out that our business and operations may be involved in any way we will take immediate steps to make sure we don't have anything to do with this, and we will not allow ourselves to be involved."

Madden said Rogers was unaware the business was operating until CBC contacted the company.

Rogers said it hopes to work with vendors to help ensure the practices described in CBC News' investigation end.

Meanwhile, Winnipeg-based Kijiji said there "will be a full investigation into this issue and will continue to take appropriate action to ensure these people and businesses are held responsible for their actions."<|endoftext|>The first game of the 2017-18 NHL hockey season for the Philadelphia Flyers is now officially in the books.

I think that's what people are looking for to try to get some money from these cheap cell phone plans," he said.

"And if they can't get a plan they like, they'll just go to an online or some other place and they might get some calls or text messages or whatever from some of these people."

"People come here from Saskatchewan and they buy an iPhone 5S and then they go to Alberta, and they'll get an iPhone 4S," added David St. Jean, who owns a Saskatoon cellular service business called Cellular One.

He and Ng said they've received phone calls from people in Saskatchewan asking for advice about how to get a similar deal on an iPhone 4S in Manitoba or a plan in Saskatchewan where local telecoms aren't as strong.

David St. Jean, of Saskatoon. (CBC)

St. Jean said that while these third-party dealers charge high rates, it's a small price to pay for the cheaper smartphone. People typically pay around $70 a month for their cell phone plans, but they can pay $40 to $50 with a third-party dealer, who sells them what they can get for under the phone plans listed on his websites.

In Saskatchewan, he recently got some "ludicrous" phone plans for $40 or above.

The ads for the $48 cellphone plans tell people how to get the same deals by buying a prepaid or prepaid plan from one of his website's sellers: cellphoneexchange.com, cellcheaperig.com or cellularone.com.

They ask prospective customers to go to their websites and look for any deal available, including the $48 cellphone plans, said Ng.

Ng said what's happening is more lucrative than illegal drugs or prostitution because it is difficult for the RCMP or the telecoms to trace the phone numbers.

"There is not really a way of proving whether or not these are real phone numbers that are not authorized to take calls," said Ng. "There is no system for dealing with them."

This is not the first time cellphone retailers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba have tried to get a rise out of SaskTel and Manitoba Telecom Services by offering cell phone service at lower rates.

In 2014, cellphone sellers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba used aggressive calls to Saskatchewan cellphone retailers to try to sell discounted prepaid cellphone plans.

CBC News made several attempts to reach out to the operators of those phone companies, but their offices were closed that day. Calls were instead directed to the provincial telecoms.

Kijiji ads from cellphoneexchange.com, for example, promise to have a two-year contract if you buy a subsidized smartphone — a device at the discounted price.

Another ad from Cellular One, on the subject of "cell phones in Saskatoon, Man.," says it is also selling a "slimline iPhone 5s for the same price as the regular iPhone 5s. $99."

"You can pick up a phone today for $95, the same price as a cellphone plan from your local SaskTel or MTS (Manitoba Telecom Services). The deal is great."

The cellphone companies are looking into the issue of low-price cellphone deals for customers, industry spokesman Dan McTeague said.

"We're certainly watching this issue," he told CBC News, in regards to the third-party dealers.

"We know that they (third party dealers) are doing stuff that is not permitted under the law as well as violating some of our policies."

But McTeague pointed out that the price difference between a subsidized smartphone price — where the phone supplier pays the retail price, minus any incentives — and the price

He calls these deals an example of "craigslist on steroids."

Mobile phones selling for $49 is still considered a bargain by some but has also led to complaints from consumers. (Joe)

Ng, a mobile phone enthusiast, says he receives at least 200 complaints every week from people who say there are no other reasonable deals available to them, even if other carriers have them for $99 or more.

"When you're talking about a $49 cellphone package, to me that's a pretty big deal," he says.

Ng has been keeping a tally of the complaints he receives through an email list. He figures the real figure could be upwards of 1,000.

That's because a lot involve complaints of overcharging.

'Selling your freedom'

Gilles Ménard, a French graduate student in Manitoba, has been shopping around for a cellphone plan without his Canadian carriers since April.

"I'm willing to pay more for a decent cellphone plan, but I don't want to spend more than I've already spent," he says.

Ménard is happy to pay $48 a month with Rogers, but he says many other cellphone companies offer deals less expensive for the same data.

As for the $48 cellphone deals, Ménard has no complaints.

"I don't think there are a lot of people who'd pay $48 to get the same service without that kind of contract," he says. "It seems like it would be selling your freedom to get one on these deals."

"If Rogers, Bell or any of those big carriers can sell a cellphone for $47, I think you can definitely do it for less, particularly if you're getting a prepaid plan. It's a lot easier to do that."

Katelyn Purnell, seven, made the horrific mistake of ordering a family Christmas dinner from her local restaurant in Birmingham, England

The meal included a side of salad and leftovers of roast chicken, mashed potatoes, carrots, celery and parsnips

It was all supposed to be eaten with her mum, but Katelyn forgot to bring the veg with her

When she started to eat her meal, Katelyn fell ill and had to be taken to hospital


The kitchen staff later had to cut off most of the leftover food after Katelyn vomited and had a seizure


An incredibly rude and humiliating Christmas dinner turned into a nightmare for a seven-year-old British girl when her mum's family left her in charge of preparing dinner because they couldn't find a proper restaurant.

Katelyn Purnell is lucky to be alive, having escaped more severe hospital treatment but her parents say they 'never imagined' what their child would suffer.


Astonishingly, the dinner in question came from the local family restaurant in Birmingham - and a very odd choice of meal, which included a side salad and leftovers of roast chicken, mashed potatoes, carrots, celery and parsnips.

It's not about competition; it's about collusion. It's people saying, 'If you don't have a cellphone plan, you don't buy any.'"

Ng has personally seen an ad offering a second-hand cellphone for $46 at a Kijiji post in Toronto.

"My gut feeling says in that situation the consumer has no choice but to pay a very high amount of money for a new phone," he told CBC News.

He says he's seen an ad for an unused cellphone number in Saskatchewan for only $50, but believes that could easily be an old contract number that is already being used by someone else to buy a new phone.

One ad offers a phone for $49 that is available in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and PEI for $49 or less.

Rogers says it does not condone this kind of activity, but can't do much about it: The company controls cell phone numbers used to sell plans.

What can you do about it?

You don't have to buy a second or more than one cellphone.

You can sign up to receive text alerts about promotions, news, deals or sales for your cell phone plans.

You also can ask some of your service providers to put your cellphone number on hold when you call for urgent or important information.

You can also purchase prepaid mobile plans. This service allows you to buy a device and a plan and pay for it over a period of months. Plans start at $50.

If you are a heavy cellphone subscriber and your service provider is charging you for a third-party plan that seems to be going unmetered or has an unfair cancellation policy that you feel is against the law, you can also report it to the province of your home province.

When you call for one of those services, you may talk with a tech-savvy person, but you also should be very aware he has the ability to get your information from an outside source.

You should also check the plans and contract prices posted by companies with direct access to your phone number. Those should have the lowest prices. Some companies, however, may offer only plans at a special reduced rate if you buy one with another carrier.

If you are paying for a device and are not getting a phone plan that suits you, tell your provider that.

If you sign up for a service agreement, tell your carrier that you want to change the type of plan you are taking and give them a list of reasons for the change.

When you switch carriers, your phone plans must be terminated, but you may want to keep your number on hold for the time being if you're worried about an expensive contract cancellation fee. Your new carrier will be required to send a bill to you.

A CBC News audit of cellphone contracts filed in Saskatchewan revealed that contracts with Telus cost $869 while those with SaskTel and Fido cost $484. If you sign up for another carrier's plan you must pay out the difference in the monthly amounts.

You can contact telecom companies directly at their websites to complain or negotiate.

Rogers and Kijiji didn't respond to calls and emails from CBC News. Telus did not respond to CBC's questions.

 to get back to the main BlackBerry Hub.

Expanding on the gesture interface, there is a gesture where you slide down from the top of an app to reveal even more settings that the developer couldn't fit on the bottom row or tabs, but the thing is, you don't ever know if there are more settings. You have to swipe down to check, and most of the time using the BlackBerry Z10, I kept forgetting to do this and wasn't able to customize some apps when I wanted to.

There are a couple huge problems with BlackBerry 10 that I just do not understand. The first is notifications. This should be something RIM can nail, but notifications in BlackBerry 10 are a straight up mess.

First off, when you're in an app or even on the home screen and you get a message, an email, a text — whatever — there is no visible notification on the screen. You get an audible notification if you set one, you get a vibrate notification, but you do not see anything on the screen. There is nothing that scrolls by, or flips down, or pops up, that gives you an idea of what kind of notification you got or a preview of it.

To make things worse, you have
==================== COMPLETION 133 ====================
 to manually go to a notification center to actually see what is happening — and it also doesn't seem that there are more than one notification for any app. On a few occasions, RIM had me going to a separate section of the homescreen just to find out what was going on with some apps — for an example, an email was showing a message, and on my home screen, the notification center just said "Notification Center."

Second, on the Hub, you have to go to your notification center to change the app's default notifications. RIM's own Hub offers just six options, the first being the app settings. There is no separate option for setting an app as your default notification for that app. You essentially have to change your notification settings — which is no different than BlackBerry 10 home screen settings, just on one app at a time.

I know BlackBerry 10 has been in beta testing for more than a month now, and I did not notice this problem until I had more or less used the device for a few months, but it doesn't make sense to me. RIM needs to start fixing notifications, or at least get the hub functionality and the Hub built in with a dedicated notification setting. This would be a huge upgrade over the current software, and the ability of customers to pick and choose where notifications go.

On the positive side of things, the touchscreen and the physical keyboard give the BlackBerry Z10 one of the most exciting handsets I've used this year. It's a shame, though, because RIM hasn't delivered a device that rivals BlackBerry 10 with a keyboard that is either better or worth the trade-off needed to make it worth using in the first place. The BlackBerry 10 keyboard is a joy from a typing standpoint, but the buttons make the screen a little annoying, and there isn't any way to change it.

This keyboard is not only the best BlackBerry keyboard I've ever used but also the easiest to type on. You can swipe up on the trackpad to scroll through an entire paragraph, or swipe down to scroll through a paragraph by one word. Most phones today have a scrolling effect that you have to activate manually, with the Z10 having one by default. You can actually scroll through more letters than other phones, with just a little help.

As for the QWERTY physical keyboard that you find on the BlackBerry Z10, it is one of the best I have ever used. Most current Android phones, though, like HTC's One X, offer a physical keyboard that doesn't require any finger or eye movement to use — a physical keyboard that does everything you need it to do.

In most other QWERTY operating systems, the keyboard isn't even as good as BlackBerry's on the Z10 — the keyboard does not allow for all of the letter swipes as well as BlackBerry's does. On the iPad, you swipe all the way up, right, left, down, left, forward or back to move and enter text. On the iPhone, you swipe up to start a word for example. The BlackBerry keyboard does not do this. You swipe up for all of the letters on a word (although only up for most types of letters). You can only use these two swipes (a swipe, not a double tap) to enter certain types of numbers, punctuation and symbols.

Some other aspects of the BlackBerry's keyboard that are nice to see are the double tap to start autocorrect which is useful in conversations with friends or at the restaurant or in the office, and the ability to add the phone number directly below the letter you're swiping up — so if you're swiping up on a letter, you can enter the phone number, so you can type and talk,

 to get back to the main BlackBerry Hub.

Expanding on the gesture interface, there is a gesture where you slide down from the top of an app to reveal even more settings that the developer couldn't fit on the bottom row or tabs, but the thing is, you don't ever know if there are more settings. You have to swipe down to check, and most of the time using the BlackBerry Z10, I kept forgetting to do this and wasn't able to customize some apps when I wanted to.

There are a couple huge problems with BlackBerry 10 that I just do not understand. The first is notifications. This should be something RIM can nail, but notifications in BlackBerry 10 are a straight up mess.

First off, when you're in an app or even on the home screen and you get a message, an email, a text — whatever — there is no visible notification on the screen. You get an audible notification if you set one, you get a vibrate notification, but you do not see anything on the screen. There is nothing that scrolls by, or flips down, or pops up, that gives you an idea of what kind of notification you got or a preview of it.

To make things worse, you have
==================== COMPLETION 134 ====================
 to manually trigger the notifications to scroll. If you're in the BlackBerry Messenger app, when you receive an incoming call, when your message reaches the edge, there is no way to scroll to see the incoming message. You can't swipe left and right and see if your message is already being read.

One of my biggest complaints is just how inconsistent notifications are. Sometimes you get them on time, sometimes they come at your phone even at half hour intervals. I'm still not completely happy with this, though I can't complain too much about just how good the Google Now implementation is either.

I'll come back to the Android and BlackBerry 10 apps later in the review.

The second major problem that I have with BlackBerry 10 is how limited the app selection is at this point. There is almost no way to get apps not from the Play Store on any Blackberry. The only other option right now is to either unlock the bootloader or purchase an app that is blacklisted from the Play Store, but even then you can only install BlackBerry apps with the BH Blackberry app on your phone or if you have a special software to install BlackBerry apps that can't be installed because they take too long to uninstall.

The real game changer that Blackberry has on Android? For a new smartphone company, Blackberry has nailed the look. Blackberry 10 looks and feels like a solid mobile OS with great attention to quality. I am not a huge fan of the black version of the new BlackBerry Z10, but I can't say that about a number of BlackBerry products ever.

The hardware of the BlackBerry Z10 is what sold me on the device and has made me very curious about buying another Blackberry. I am also a fan of the new BlackBerry Hub and the gesture interface.

BlackBerry 10 is probably the best BlackBerry 10 is probably the best smartphone there is. At $699 (in the US), the Z10 is much more affordable than a Samsung Galaxy S4 or LG Optimus G or even Apple's iPhone 6S Plus.

BlackBerry 10 is the best Blackberry platform ever because it offers excellent quality built-in apps, a great interface, amazing build and finishes, and a beautiful camera. BlackBerry has been very good about developing apps, and they have been solid and useful apps over the past couple of years, and especially on the BlackBerry 10 Z10.

BlackBerry 10 is also the best Android phone there is because it features Android 4.4 KitKat, which is almost as good as the latest version on Samsung's Galaxy S5.

There is one more problem I have to add, but this is something I expect to be solved in time. Some applications from the Play Store that were on the BlackBerry Android devices never seem to get updated on BlackBerry 10. There is even the annoying situation where I can't use some BlackBerry 10 applications right now in one browser window, which is also not true when I use them on another Android device. And, of course, there is Android Lollipop, which is getting an update right now to 4.4 which adds more memory, improves some of the interface, and fixes a lot of UI bugs.

In short, if you are on either the Samsung Galaxy S4 or LG Optimus G, you can't go wrong with Android 4.4 KitKat on a BlackBerry, so BlackBerry 10 is the best you are going to find.

With that being said, I don't intend to rush to buy any more BlackBerry phones. When they release new specs, I'll be sure to upgrade, but for now, I'll stick with an old phone just to get the latest. Android 4.4 KitKat is a fantastic OS that I am getting used to, and I do hope

To make things worse, you have
==================== COMPLETION 135 ====================
 to navigate back to a notification and make note of it. I'm not sure if you can do this in other BlackBerry 10 environments, but on the BlackBerry Z10, I had to scroll to a notification and then go back and check on it on my home screen with a double tap in order to get a good idea of what was going on.

This was the first BlackBerry 10 app I've ever seen that did not show me a live preview of the message I was checking on when I was using it. A screen flip would have done a better job of showing me what was going on, since I know what the notification says before I open the app.

I'm not the only one that feels this way. The other day, I was in my messaging app and I saw a notification that said "you got a call." I pressed the call button and I didn't even get an indicator of what was happening — just just a vibrate, a message, and a single button. There's no indication on the screen about how long the phone is in standby, how much time you can expect to have until the call rings, how often you get calls, what kind of service you have, what time you have to be ready to answer the call, how long the call is, and how many missed calls your carrier has sent you in the last few days.

This is absolutely terrible notification design. RIM has promised to fix it, since it is clearly a major feature that will greatly impact how people use their phones. After all, they have to deal with spam notifications and phone calls. I hope RIM fixes all of this, but it'll be difficult for them to find a fix that works for everyone.

In the next week or two, I predict RIM will change its UI on its phones again. And while I still have major reservations about its UI and design philosophy on the BlackBerry Z10, I'm excited about what will happen to all the apps in these redesigned BlackBerry 10 devices, since it's going to be a big step forward from what we had on the BlackBerry 7.

When all the apps are redesigned, the new BlackBerry 10 OS will have a truly cohesive look, much better than it does now. There will be more apps there in the new apps space than we have right now, and I'm excited to see how well all the apps run. It will be nice in the new BlackBerry phones to have a unified search experience for the phones and for the BlackBerry Messenger.<|endoftext|>The U.S. has been on the defensive ever since it revealed its new cyber-defenses in mid-July. As the nation's leading expert on cyber threats, DHS was called upon to defend the U.S. from attacks on its government, its institutions of higher learning, and private enterprises.

DHS was also required to report directly to the president and Congress on the progress of its efforts for four years. These reports—which are now available online—are critical to a functioning cyber-defence program. They provide both a window into the program's progress as well as a roadmap for its implementation.

While a lot more information is available—and some reports provide useful insights—all of this information comes with a catch. As long as U.S. and allied government and military organizations are willing to make the compromises necessary to defend themselves, an attacker will always find a way to infiltrate their systems. There was a time when this may have seemed a disadvantage, but since our cyber-defences are designed to protect against an increasingly diverse range of attacks, this situation is a long way from ideal.

The vulnerability of some of our institutions and critical infrastructure places an enormous burden on the federal government, and not just for its people. If

You get an audible notification if you set one, you get a vibrate notification, but you do not see anything on the screen. There is nothing that scrolls by, or flips down, or pops up, that gives you an idea of what kind of notification you got or a preview of it.

To make things worse, you have
==================== COMPLETION 136 ====================
 different types of notifications, and not all the types are displayed on the screen. I tried to type the name of a message, or the name of some music album, and the entire thing is hidden underneath a "I want to read this" type notification. It looks like a small banner at the bottom, but it's completely unusable.

Notifications only work with BlackBerry 10 on a few BlackBerry 10 devices; including the BlackBerry Z30 and the BlackBerry Z10 and the BlackBerry Z10 (we're still running BlackBerry 10 on our BlackBerry Z30 and Z10, so we have no idea if we'll get notifications issues there).

When you have a message or email on your BlackBerry Z10, you really have to go deep to see it. You can tap and hold any icon or a notification to go right to the bottom of the screen, and the bottom button lets you jump to the bottom of any message or email. On BlackBerry 10, it's even better because you can see the date, sender, subject, time, email address, attachments and even the "More" button. The problem is that if you have a lot of notifications, you might miss important ones because they are buried.

If you're at the notification screen and you need to see more information about a notification, like an attachment, then you have to tap on the notification, and again, if you're deep into the notification, there will be no preview of the notification.

Other problems: BlackBerry 10 gives no indication for when you need to look at notification content again. You really have to go to the notification pane to see it again. And the more you swipe through the notifications, the more you tap-and-hold to flip to the bottom of them to see what they're about. To make matters worse, if you don't want to, you can't even go back to your own apps like Twitter, or the Twitter app. The Twitter App is completely buried under BlackBerry Hub, and for no apparent reason. You can't even close the Twitter App or see its home screen, and you can't switch to the BlackBerry News app. There are no options to close apps or switch to others from the notification pane. It's kind of a mess.

Then you have the problem of swiping through notifications and being in the middle of a conversation and having no idea what is happening inside that conversation. BlackBerry Hub keeps popping up notifications on your screen, and it's impossible or cumbersome to jump between the conversations using the BlackBerry 10 swipe and swipe gestures because you might miss the new message or an email from a different conversation that has just happened, or you might miss a tweet from a different user and you can't go back to the original one.

The worst part is that if you go into BlackBerry Manager and get more notifications in a row than you actually want or need, you have to switch back to the home screen, and if there are not any more alerts in the message, email, conversation list or anything else, you have to start again.

On BlackBerry World, you do have an option called BlackBerry Hub Apps and you can set up different applications to be a hub for all the BlackBerry Hub notifications and different parts of the OS, but there is no easy way to turn the BlackBerry Hub off or customize it.

With all of these issues, it's really difficult to get excited about BlackBerry 10. BlackBerry 10 is the first BlackBerry OS that I've really gotten used to, but it's a different OS than I'm used to — a new user interface that requires learning a completely new interface that takes some getting used to.

It's the same with BlackBerry Messenger — it's different, but at the same time not as confusing as the old BlackBerry Messenger. The
======================================== SAMPLE 137 ========================================
 the 1970s is the observation that a similar sort of problem arises for prudential reasons (e.g. Nagel 1970). If I am going to travel to Israel in six months' time and will regret not knowing any Hebrew once I get there, then I have a reason to study Hebrew now, even if I don't now care about my future regrets or about whether I will know Hebrew while I am in Israel. Yet internalist theses place constraints on what I now have a reason to do, on the basis of what my actual psychology is like now, or on the basis of what counterfactuals are true of me now. So they appear to have a problem in getting these intuitive judgments about reasons right. This argument is thought to produce extra dialectical leverage, because these intuitions about prudential reasons are thought to be harder to give up than corresponding intuitions about moral reasons.

Two lines of response are open to the internalist here. One, proposed by Mark Schroeder (2007b) in defense of the Humean Theory of Reasons, denies that internalism is genuinely incompatible with the inescapability of some moral or prudential reasons. If there are some actions that would serve any possible desire (or, on an alternative internalist account
==================== COMPLETION 137 ====================
 in advance of this one, have their utility maximized) then, in such cases, the internal agent can show that these actions are prudential actions, not mere desires. This is a challenge to externalism because an externalist account of reasons for acting as external beings would also support this argument. If all reasons for acting are desires, then the argument suggests that we can never fully satisfy our desires. But if not, externalism is not self-defeating. One might still say that in cases in which all actions will be inescapable, this means there are prudential reasons to act, in a kind of externalist, defeasible way that can be used by opponents to avoid internalism (Schroeder 2007b, 2008, 2013). A second response to the argument is to deny that there is a strong sense in which one prudentially reasons something over and against another. In Schroeder's view, there is no sense in which the internal agent justifies the action over and against the reasons for which her agent is now subject. Externalist views, by contrast, are internally motivated in a manner that is non-rational. It is not clear that, in contrast to this, the Humean Theory does not have a sense in which one prudentially reasons the agent's current motives over and against her actual reasons (Schroeder 2007a). It can be said, then, that what externalists say is not self-defeating, but the Humean account is.

If the argument for internalism relies on internalist intuitions about reasons, why should externalists be satisfied? One response is that the internalist intuitions are not necessarily correct and should be taken into account in one's thinking about internalism. That is, the internalist is still free to adopt the externalist's view that reason and motivation are non-rational features. In particular, she is free to adopt the externalist's view that the agent's motivational states can be mistaken or otherwise misconstrued. That is, an internalist can suppose that the agent's actions are motivated because it has been mistakenly assumed by her that the internal state she is in now represents the agent's true motivational state, rather than an unrealizable (or falsifiability) goal. Externalist views are free to do the same; if they don't, then the theory does not do justice to externalist intuitions about reasons. On internalist accounts, we are able to think that we have reasons only if our reasons are correctly understood. The internalist can then maintain that, if we can think we have reasons, then that makes us rational. The central thesis of moral internalism is that the internal state, or at least a relevant part of it, is a reliable and relevant indicator of the agent's true motivational state. Even if one denies this, that does not entail that it is irrational to think we have reasons. What if we think that we still have those reasons after all, but that because our reasoning is internally biased and incomplete, we may be wrong in our thinking? And what if we are?

The Humean argument against internalism has been criticized on other grounds. Peter van Inwagen calls it a "problematic" argument for moral internalism, which has as its premise that reasons cannot be mistaken (van Inwagen 1980, 1988, 1995; 2005, 2015). The Humean might say, of course, that if my cognitive faculties are faulty, then I am likely to be wrong in thinking I have reasons to act as I do. But the problem runs further: how can the Humean be right about that? Can the Humean be correct in attributing to me the sort of motivation to act I believe is in other people despite having reason to believe that I have no such motivational state?

 the 1970s is the observation that a similar sort of problem arises for prudential reasons (e.g. Nagel 1970).

If there are some actions that would serve any possible desire (or, on an alternative internalist account
==================== COMPLETION 138 ====================
, some desires that would serve the desires that have just appeared), then the fact that these reasons would then have to count in favor of them does not entail that it is impossible to count these reasons in favor of them. So internalists that think this can be done by appeal to the fact that in the world an agent would be perfectly happy to have any reason to perform any action and that it is simply not implausible that moral reasons exist for the actions for which there seem to be no non-moral reasons at all. But if this internalist holds that moral reasons do not count as reasons for any action, then one might claim that (1) would still follow, as it would no longer follow on the claim that in general one could perform any action with any reason whatsoever, because it would turn on the fact that a specific action would be wrong even if one could perform it. The fact that a person would not perform an action that is against his or her self-interest (that is, one in which his or her own actions were required, by the laws of nature, to ensure that one's own good or happiness was better than that of everyone else) would be a reason to prevent such actions while not compelling one's refusal to perform them. This is not to say, however, that this is necessarily the case, or even that such reasons could never function as reasons, if an agent were disposed to recognize them as such. This is an issue of whether or not the agent would be able to recognize such reasons, and it is not the issue of what it would mean to say such a thing. On the internalist's account, one would have to give up on any internal commitment to moral and prudential reason, to say that one has no reason to think it is rational to act in a certain fashion.

This objection to internalism is, as Schroeder concedes, not entirely satisfactory. The most basic difficulty here is that internalism allows any agent to have the normative intuition that it is rational to act in a certain fashion even while acting contrary to what she thinks in all the circumstances. But what this means is that on any rationalistic account of ethics, the agent could have a reason to not act in exactly the same way. This amounts to what Schroeder calls "the 'realist' objection to internalism." If the agent thinks that what she ought to say is not what all of the circumstances should suggest, but what she should say in the best possible circumstances, then this does seem true by her own lights. But if her agentist intuition is not true to her, then she can never have a rational basis for acting in the way that reflects her rational intuition in any way compatible with the inescapability of reason or of prudential reasons.

There are reasons, however, which internalists need to offer in order to avoid the "realist" objection. In addressing this objection, one needs to explain who exactly is acting against what he or she thinks is her self-interest, and to what ends he or she is seeking to attain. What one can say about the agent's judgment with respect to the relevant reasons, about her judgment about what she ought to say, and about the reason for why she wishes to accomplish the purpose she has in mind would be important contributions to an analysis of moral and prudential reasons.

In this vein, it is important to explain how the internalist can avoid the "realist objection." The internalist is allowed to acknowledge that on the agent's judgment the situation has a certain sort of desirability, and on the agent's judgment, it is rational to act differently (on that judgment) than it would be if her moral intuitions were not so affected. But this will not prevent the agent from seeing the situation

If there are some actions that would serve any possible desire (or, on an alternative internalist account
==================== COMPLETION 139 ====================
, the desire to do them), then the internalist will be right that there is a prima facie case of them being obligatory or at least non-indefensible. The second line of response, proposed by Alchian (2012) in "On Internalization and the Humean Theory of Reasons," is to point out that the fact that intuitions have to play the same role in moral and prudential reasoning as they do in our everyday cognitive activity supports the Humean Theory of Reasons, as opposed to those internalist views which deny moral reasons their ordinary normative status. These internalist arguments on behalf of the Humean Theory of Reasons are controversial, in part because so many authors have argued that the argument that moral reasons cannot be external to or in tension with our cognitive process depends on a kind of internalist thesis that is problematic in its connection to our everyday moral beliefs. (These objections may be addressed in section 3.3 below.)

Arguments against a Humean Theory of Reasons are common in the literature, as well as in the philosophy of mind more generally. It is notable that these Humean arguments are most often directed against more sophisticated forms of internalist theories, such as the "principle of sufficient conditions" doctrine developed in the work developed in the 1960s by Nozick (1969). The "principle of sufficient conditions" theory does not deny the inescapability of moral reasons. Rather, the principle is held to be the view that we have a reason to avoid doing what we know will bring about a bad result for us as a matter of virtue on any one of about a hundred grounds, and also that we have a reason to do what we know will bring about a virtuous result on a hundred other grounds. The Humean Theory of Reasons, in contrast to the more sophisticated "principle of sufficient conditions," is thought to deny the inescapability of moral reasons—and hence of the Humean Theory of Reasons—by claiming that reasons not on the list might nevertheless have an impact on us, and some are even "irrevocably" part of our nature.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the most influential form of the "principle of sufficient conditions" was developed in a series of papers by Peter Railton (1967)–1971). At its heart was the idea that a sufficient condition for a certain sort of moral behavior is that its consequences should not only be morally indifferent toward you, or toward your action in general, but also should only be morally indifferent toward any person you happen to be. When, say, you are faced with a friend who is in need, the only moral thing you should do is to lend money to another person in need, though by such lending you may come to depend, and to have obligations towards, the person you lend the money to. Railton claimed that we should be sensitive to these facts, not least in determining our moral obligations (Railton 1971). (See also Batson 1997, Chisholm 1997, and Nussbaum 1992.)

An internalist, as someone who understands the thesis that we have certain mental states that are intrinsically valuable as rational or morally valuable, might reject Railton's "principle of sufficient conditions." But Railton's critics, especially those sympathetic to the "principle of sufficient conditions" approach, usually defend the same conclusions as Railton: that a sufficient condition for a variety of morally important behaviors is that they should be consistent with the facts about the agent's mental state. And, more generally, they also defend the idea that there is a moral and, by extension, a prudential reason to take our moral and prudential reasons seriously, and accordingly to try to follow those reasons in acting appropriately, prudentially.
======================================== SAMPLE 140 ========================================
 the 1970s is the observation that a similar sort of problem arises for prudential reasons (e.g. Nagel 1970). If I am going to travel to Israel in six months' time and will regret not knowing any Hebrew once I get there, then I have a reason to study Hebrew now, even if I don't now care about my future regrets or about whether I will know Hebrew while I am in Israel.

Two lines of response are open to the internalist here. One, proposed by Mark Schroeder (2007b) in defense of the Humean Theory of Reasons, denies that internalism is genuinely incompatible with the inescapability of some moral or prudential reasons. If there are some actions that would serve any possible desire (or, on an alternative internalist account
==================== COMPLETION 140 ====================
, some agents would have different desires from the ones that are possible), then externalism is false. On this account, moral values aren't internal facts at all. But if reasons for action are internally held, then they cannot be contingently necessary and possible for all beings (since every being would prefer them, and there is no reason to believe that every being is disposed to prefer them, let alone that they are in fact disposed (see section 2.1). So internalism isn't true, and the Humean is simply wrong about the connection between morality and the rational content of our reasons). This account runs into difficulty in that it takes values to be something independent of one's reason-holding capacities. But they are not. We have rational reasons for doing things like eating healthy food only if our own values compel such action. In such instances, there is nothing that prevents you from choosing an unhealthy diet and then eating only unhealthy food (if you were not forced to do so by your values of health). Moreover, the idea of rationality as a kind of reason for action is a fairly recent one. It wasn't evident to Kant or to Fichte, and Kant's own concept is a kind of internalism (see entry on Kant's concept of rational judgment). On a Humean account, our rational capacities come into play only as we come to use them. In other words, the "reason" that underlies our action doesn't just come from a rational agency; it also comes from our desires. Thus a Kantian would also have to say that, if we come to believe and act upon a Kantian desire – which could happen to be a strong value – we are doing so on our own rational merit and without using any appeal to an external reason. If so, then we could be externalists at least against Humean externalism. But there's no such Kantian internalist.

Second, Schroeder, for his part, thinks that some reason's justification can be external to the person (see entry on Kant's concept of justification). Schroeder argues that a person's having a reason for doing something can be a matter of reason's justification in a way that is independent of one's preferences or preferences' justification (in other words, a Humean can't be an internalist at all). If it's true that our reasons (however they are obtained) do involve our values (i.e., in the way we think they do), then it remains a matter of some (possibly external) justification for believing in reasons. Hence, Schroeder thinks, it isn't really difficult to show that we don't need external justification for our reasons or our values (Schroeder 2002, 109; 2004, chapter 3 ).

In response to such arguments against internalism, the externalists maintain that we should not allow our reasons and preferences to matter in ways that would turn their content 'external'. As the externalists point out, a person's being in one condition could be a reason for that person to act in another. It would be a mistake, for example, to think that the fact that it is raining makes it objectively desirable to go to bed before 6pm. Rather, that fact is indicative of the fact that one is in one of the possible conditions in which it might occur, and it is the fact that there is a rainstorm that underlies the belief that it will rain eventually. As the externalists put it, externalism can't be used to reject a 'non-self-sufficient' account of reasons or beliefs or values. Instead, externalism may be used to reduce reasons or beliefs or values to the facts about the world that are in the world, and to show how these facts are a result of our being in one of those conditions.

"This is about what's best for children here in the United States. And the social science is irrefutable," Reed said. "And it is that a child who grows up in a home without the mother and father present and they both play very unique procreative, nurturing and socializing role, they're nine times more likely to end up dropping out of high school. They're five times more likely to end up in poverty. And they're three times more likely to end up addicted to drugs and alcohol."

The social science statistics Reed called "irrefutable" actually have nothing to do with gay couples raising kids. Instead, they're focused on the effects of children who grow up without a father in a one-parent household. Put another way, the studies focus on the quantity of parents and not their gender.

Reed's office pointed us to his book , as well as a Brookings Institution report that says parents who graduate from high school and bear children within marriage have a 2 percent chance of living in poverty. But neither the study nor his
==================== COMPLETION 141 ====================
 book specifically mentions gay parents.

That's because none of the studies focus on the gender of the parent in the home. Instead of studying the number of parents, the studies look at how children fare without them.

The one social science study to examine gay parents' impact on children is a 2011 study of about 7,000 children from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Researchers found that children without fathers in their homes scored significantly lower than children whose fathers were present -- 2.5 percentage points lower.

The study does not say gay parents make a difference for the children, but it's clear from the results that gay parents have a negative effect.

We checked with the National Center for Education Statistics , which maintains the data on low-income students' scores on state standardized exams. According to NCES , in 2009 the national average IQ score of 8-, 9- and 10-year-old children was 111. The average IQ scores of children whose biological fathers served in the military during that same time period was 115, and the average IQ scores of children with two biological mothers was 113, so a 3-point gap is statistically significant.

We asked the Institute of Medicine in March 2013 to cite research showing the effect on kids of different types of family structures, including single, divorced or common-law parents, same-sex parents, married and unmarried, single-parent families -- and also between different types of fathers' jobs. The answer we're awaiting from the Institute of Medicine, which has had a history of opposing same-sex marriage, is: It depends.

The 2010 World Health Organization report on child health found a 10 percent gap in the rate of poverty between children living in same-sex and heterosexual homes. A 2009 study of a group of children adopted by same-sex couples found no difference from children living with heterosexual parents, or if the child was born to same-sex parents.

The 2010 study of children adopted from China looked at the cognitive abilities of children at age 6, and was led by University of British Columbia professor Gary Rubinstein and published in the journal Developmental Psychology .

His conclusion: "There was no statistically significant evidence that children were significantly better off if their biological mothers are lesbian."

We found Rubinstein's conclusion and the World Health Organization report on poverty and poverty gaps on poverty rates. Researchers from Sweden, Canada, Germany, the U.S. and others conducted in-depth studies over several decades that looked at rates of poverty around the world , and from those findings, have projected the populations they estimate will be living in poverty by 2030 -- including those who were born to same sex partners or were conceived through artificial insemination.

They found that children born to lesbian mothers in same-sex couples are "much less likely to have the very high levels of poverty, particularly among the very poor of their own country" than children raised by heterosexual parents.

For the past decade the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been tracking poverty rates in states. It's done this by examining a national survey of people who are at risk of poverty and who get health insurance through the Medicaid program. One of the numbers researchers looked at is the percentage of individuals between 19 and 64 who are living in poverty.

The CDC says its researchers have "found no evidence that children or adults who were born to mothers who were in same-sex relationships have higher poverty rates compared with children of mothers who were not in same-sex relationships."

The CDC's data also show that children in same-sex couples had lower unemployment and were more likely to have completed higher education when they were 18 than people raised by heterosexual parents.

There are, of course, caveats around such a

Our ruling

Reed said that "the social science is irrefutable" that gay couples raise children better than straight couples raise children.

The only solid evidence to substantiate this assertion is a 2006 report from the National Academy of Sciences, which also found that children of parents who were divorced were more likely to experience drug or alcohol problems and engage in crime. But that study only examines the children who were exposed to both divorced parents and children raised by single parents.

It would be unfair to judge gay parents in the absence of the more rigorous research on the impact of single parent households. But since that's an area where gay advocates have a better statistical record and data, they are not arguing that same-sex couples are in any way harmed.

We rate Reed's claim True.

https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/afb8d0d8-8ff9-4c0e-99a3-b879c3f9a6b8<|endoftext|>The most famous image in politics is undoubtedly George Bush's famous, famous black limousine. It is also one that has been the subject of much controversy. There is the controversy of whether and how it was stolen after the crash of Air Force One and the subsequent cover-up - and there is another major controversy surrounding the image: whether we should still call it the "Bush limousine"? That is not a matter to be swept aside by a single tweet.

As the debate rages on, it may be useful to try to trace the origins of the limousine. It turns out that it is one of many images from the 1980 Reagan campaign that have been used as props by generations of artists. The "Bush limo" is just one of these. Take the "The Best of Both Worlds" limousine image, from 1980, which was widely distributed as part of an advertising campaign for the 1984 movie of the same name. It features a young Ronald Regan with an open window at either side of the car. The limousine is being driven on the left by the young Sarah Palin - on the right is President Reagan and the Democratic candidate, incumbent governor of California Jerry Brown, a former Republican who had become a Democrat. The limousine is also being driven under a big banner that reads both "Reagan/Brown" and "Best of Both Worlds".

The "Bush limo" is a variation of this image, made famous by the cover of a 1987 catalogue of campaign gifts, the "I Want a President". The photograph is taken in a state of heightened political conflict. On the left, a Republican candidate takes on a young Democrat in a campaign ad that is likely to be seen by millions of American voters.

In the picture, you can just make out a young Ronald Regan - he is a little to the left, at the left edge on the right. But he is not alone in the limousine. The image is a composite of a picture of George Bush arriving at an Air Force One refueling plane with Sarah Palin with a similar window position at the left end. The limousine is then driven into a field. The image on the front cover of the "I Want a President" catalogue is a composite of many photographs that were taken from the ground.

Although there are lots of copies of the limousine photo on the Internet, there is no evidence that the picture is copyrighted as far as I know, so there is little likelihood of a big lawsuit for copyright infringement and, of course, it is likely that these images could be bought. For all the attention they have attracted, they are far from the

Experts at both the left and right of the political spectrum agree that the impact an individual gay parent can have on a child's life could well be more profound than the effects of the straight parent.

"There's no question that there are benefits to being raised by a married couple," said Robert Kuttner, senior fellow at the American Prospect and a member of the Council on Contemporary Families. "The question is how much of that benefit is attributable to marriage and how much to the children, and how much is attributable to the parents' involvement in the birth and care of that child. And in my opinion all evidence suggests that the benefit to children is tremendous. So you can argue either way whether we should have more marriages or single-parent homes. It's a really easy way to get the political attention of people who might otherwise not pay attention to these issues."

Our rating

Reed said "The American Prospect" and a conservative think tank, The Independent Institute, "have done research in which gay parents raise children in the same rate as straight parents."

That research, as well as Reed's account, ignores the role of race, education and other variables -- factors that tend to affect a child's life -- in determining whether the child is raised in a home with a mother and father.

The research has found that gay couples who adopt are three times more likely to raise children in poverty. Reed seems to have left out the importance of race, suggesting that the benefits of gay marriage "far outweigh the costs" to children who grow up without a father who is married to the child's mother.

— A North Carolina pastor was arrested Saturday after he allegedly took his 12-year-old son into another room at the local hotel, took photographs of him and then showed them to his wife, according to an arrest warrant.

The boy, whose name is not being released due to his age, told officers that he was showing his mother some family members on the second floor of the Comfort Inn on State Highway 1806 and that he did not want to go down there.

Instead, the child said, his father led him into the room and began photographing him and showed him pictures of his penis, buttocks and breasts, the warrant states. He said the images made him feel uncomfortable, and that he told his mother, who then came into the room, too.

The boy told police his father was trying to get him to stay in the room with him so that the boy would be less stressed, the warrant states.

The boy and his mother left the room and saw another child there, according to the warrant. The boy told authorities that when he asked his mother what happened, she said the man and boy had been discussing "something sexual, which made the child uncomfortable."

The parents were taken into custody by deputies from the Durham County Sheriff's Office. The child had been booked into the Hillsborough Juvenile Detention Center on charges of indecent liberties with a child and interference of a minor.<|endoftext|>AUSTINO, Calif.—In the midst of a heated debate over the future of the Affordable Care Act in the Senate, Ted Cruz announced Tuesday he intended to force a vote to repeal parts of the law next month on a party-line vote by Republicans who don't want to vote for the measure, which many have called the most divisive issue of the 2012 and 2013 campaigns.

The Brookings Institution study looked at 40,000 high school graduates from 1978 to 2001 (and who didn't go on to college); the data it used indicated roughly 1 in 7 gay households. But it also included a lot of different family structures, from intact heterosexual families to gay single parents, including the children of gay couples and straight married couples, and also single-parent families with adopted or step-parents. What the study concluded in its abstract was that those who didn't go on to college or have children were 2 percent more likely to be unemployed than heterosexuals, and that they were 7 percent more likely to use drugs or alcohol.

The National Center for Children in Poverty did an even larger study using data from the late 1980s. It compared child poverty rates for children of gay couples who had adopted each other's children to those for straight parents who had adopted each other's children. The study found children living with gay and straight parents whose biological mother and father had married had nearly identical poverty rates, with about 10 percent less than children living with straight parents living with gay parents.

Our ruling

Gay activists claim that "social science studies" show that children raised by gay parents have worse outcomes than children raised by straight parents. And it's hard to know if the studies accurately compare children with biological parents to children raised by single parents, gay single parents, and gay co-parents.

But the studies that are cited for this claim are more focused on the question of the quantity of parents, not their gender, and they do not account for gay parents who adopt.

In fact, none of the studies that have been cited for this claim look at children raised by single gay parents.

Gay activists have made a lot of claims recently about the effects of gay marriage "on children" — none of which are backed by scientific evidence. But no matter the evidence on the effects of gay rights, the idea that "gay families are an inferior form of parenting" is not backed by scientific literature, and has no basis in social science.

Our ruling

Gay rights advocates say that studies show that children raised by gay parents fare worse than children raised by straight parents.

The evidence does not show that, but the activists are making a persuasive case that gay married couples are worse parents.

We say that the claim is Mostly True.<|endoftext|>Catherine Ashton was one of the key diplomatic players between Russia and the West during the Ukraine crisis, during which President Vladimir Putin decided to invade the country and annex Crimea. In May 2015 she announced that she was giving up her seat as president of the European Commission, and in December of that same year she left office for health reasons.

Russia's annexation of Crimea had serious repercussions on the Ukrainian economy. This was especially important to President Viktor Yanukovych. In 2012 he had said that one of his goals towards Ukraine was the construction of a pipeline from Russia to Crimea. Yanukovych did not achieve this goal.

Ukraine's total energy import cost increased significantly in 2013, due to the increased cost of imported natural gas. In May of that year, however, Yanukovych signed a $15 billion plan to build the Ukrnafta-Dnepr gas pipeline. The project remains politically contested.

On January 28th 2015, Vladimir Putin announced that Russia wished to restore the old gas trade deal with Ukraine. Ukraine has agreed to a $400 million payment from Russia on January 28th, 2015. However, it is reported in Russian business papers that Russian energy minister Alexander Novak and Ukrainian energy minister Yuri Prodan have already reached an agreement on this matter.

The deal does not cover the Ukrainian gas transit to Europe.

I'm glad I eventually did because it is fantastic. On what is mostly a beat-tape, Ugly Mane shows us he's not playing by anyone's rules. He isn't scared to define what hip hop should be.

what is so great about a bunch of singers singing in a choir? The answer is Julia Holter. She is a living musical painting of the world. It's a beautiful thing and Loud City Song is one of the best I've heard on a songwriter's album ever. The album itself is not a masterpiece. But I'm still holding onto my hopes for what comes next and the next.

4. Mac Miller – GWAR

I could hear the hype and I had no right. Miller is one of those artists who when you hear a song, you know straight away what it's about. It has a vibe. It has everything it needs to be successful. The beats on GWAR are fantastic. There's a ton of experimentation with the instruments (fuzzy, old, etc). The songwriting is great. Even the concept is great. There is very little in the way of pop on GWAR. As a matter of fact, it's a bit of a departure from Miller's previous music. He is not going for pop, but you can tell Miller is excited to be there. His sound is still a little more experimental than a lot of the artists listed above, but the approach Miller takes to songwriting is definitely worthy of respect.

3. Earl Sweatshirt – I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside

At this point I'd say I have a very fair taste. It didn't take me long to appreciate one of the most impressive and creative rappers around. The only thing holding me back is wanting to see where he takes the rap game. He has already achieved a ton of success. You can tell he's been through so much personally. He's now a father of two. Now he's also a rapper in the truest sense of the word. I think all of our ears are being touched by this project. If you haven't gotten yourself some of this, I highly recommend it.

2. Gucci Mane – Guwop

I'm pretty proud to have another Guwop release in the column. Guwop is not Gucci Mane. Gucci doesn't have the presence of a personality and he doesn't sound like a complete asshole either. In Guwop we see Gucci take his unique style and apply it to gangsta rap. He's basically just doing the shit Gucci would do if he had no other choice. He's not trying to be the next Eminem or Dr Dre. He's making Gucci rap about himself. Gucci's music is an experience. It makes you appreciate music and rap in general.

1. Mac Miller – GWAR

I have no idea who is playing the guitar on this album, but I know I can't get enough. This is a different type of album from G.W.A.R.G. The production is so fantastic and there's a lot more of it and it's more mature. If you want to get into Guwop then get GWAR. It's by FAR the best thing he has to offer.

4. Kendrick Lamar – To Pimp a Butterfly

This is the album that truly launched the black music conversation. It took a long time to make because the music industry is so damn old. Kendrick's album is very specific to his experience. He is a man of many genres but his music speaks loudly of his experience of life. It is honest and direct and his words are like a beacon of light illuminating the dark in the shadows. The album can't help but be controversial. People can't understand why he doesn't use "FDT" in this or that song. To Pimp a Butterfly is a timeless piece of art and this is my favorite moment so far.

3. Future – DS2

Now, I can't argue with the critics. A lot of people don't like Future. I don't like many people. I don't care if this was an attempt for him to be pop or whatever. His music is great. He made the most complex album of 2015. Some people think he is a clown. He may be a genius just trying to be a clown. He has the ability to be an album and a rapper combined and that is something I am all for. I've seen Future's career get derailed and I really don't care. He is already ahead of his time in some aspects so for me, the controversy is a moot point.

2. Father John Misty – Pure Comedy

It might have been a little silly at first. The album is hard-hitting and raw. It just came out of nowhere. Now when I heard Pure Comedy, I was a kid. I was a sophomore in High School and this came around like a bombshell. I think I was at the record store when we heard this. Even now, I listen to it to honor the time I spent in those stores while I was growing up (it was crazy). I think the album captures the zeitgeist of 2015 and it was something different.

1. Kendrick Lamar – Damn

Damn is the most unique and influential album of 2015. The music is all over the place, the metaphors are complex and he manages to weave different concepts in just under 20 tracks. You will never hear another album that is as complex and layered as this one. It stands alongside TDE classics like To Pimp a Butterfly and To Pimp a Butterfly Part 2 in my collection. From lyrical and melody heavy songs like "FEAR.," "DNA.," "PRIDE.," "The Blacker the Berry" and "LOVE.," to the emotional, personal and hard-hitting tracks, from "Duckworth," "i" and "Untitled 2," to the deep-rooted and complex "Untitled 12," this album is one of the best in a very long time. It makes me wish there were more great albums released this year but that won't happen. I'd like to see some of these incredible artists get back with their labels and do what they do best: create genius.

4. Kid Cudi – Man on the Moon: The End of Day

It's a shame that this had to be a triple threat, but Man on the Moon had such potential. I didn't expect it to be so big or as ambitious as it was. In short, it's the record everybody was waiting for. When Kid Cudi was done with his "normal" stuff, he brought his art to the forefront with Man on the Moon: The End of Day, where he showed off to us that he can do something even greater. I've heard comparisons to Radiohead but that doesn't give it the full meaning, it just makes me want to get that album ASAP.

3. Bodega Bamz – Bodega Volume 1

This is my new favorite album. What I love about Bodega Bamz is that it's not overthought, and the result is the most eclectic beat tape I have ever experienced. On a tape with 10 tracks, it only takes Bodega Bamz a minute to get rolling. I had to put Bodega Bamz at number three based on his "Big Boi" verse and I am completely in love with any album that features the song title "Big Boi".

2. J Balvin – Mi Gente

Like Kid Cudi, the title track of Mi Gente has everything: beats, guest artists, and guest vocalists. Not only that, it's filled with a unique feel. It's one of those albums that makes you wonder why the rest of the album isn't better. The song "Mi Gente" alone gives me 10 tracks. What makes this one special? This album.

1. Kendrick Lamar – good kid, m.A.A.d city

When Kendrick Lamar was putting all of his heart and soul into Interscope, no one was expecting the monster he was turning out. The album was a great surprise, but the best part about it was that the album was totally self-released. From the first beat right up to the last single, all of these songs were produced by Kendrick himself. You can tell his talent is in a whole other level on this album.

And before I'm done masturbating, I have to say anyone who can take the raw 80s acid house sound and turn it into a 2-minute pop song is always going to have my attention.

6. Lil Ugly Mane – THREE SIDED TAPE VOLUME ONE

A true underground legend released a tape of unused material and it was fantastic. I'll be honest, I passed over this when it was released. I downloaded it and didn't even really give it a chance. I'm glad I eventually did because it is fantastic. On what is mostly a beat-tape, Ugly Mane shows us he's not playing by anyone's rules. He isn't scared to define what hip hop should be.

5. Julia Holter – Loud City Song

When I first heard the single "World" I knew this album was going to be special. I'm going to admit I'm a sucker for art pop-type stuff. Ambient waves spilling over lavish arrangements, elegant songwriting, lyrics about cheese and hats…
==================== COMPLETION 148 ====================
 all of that and more I can totally handle. Loud City Song takes Julia Holter and pushes her music in a different direction and it is truly one of the best things for the year.

4. A$AP Rocky – Long Live A$AP

For anyone who didn't know, A$AP is a guy obsessed with fashion. He's obsessed with trends, he's obsessed with people. That makes sense because he's A$AP Rocky. I mean, you don't get the guy to keep a blog on everything but a trend blog I still believe is a step up. Also, Long Live A$AP is a dope mixtape if I ever heard one. A+

3. Ty Dolla $ign – The Adventures Of A$AP Rocky 2

If I were trying to decide who needs to make a follow-up to 2008's The Adventures Of A$AP Rocky, I would probably choose Ty. From the first breath of this album, it's clear that Ty is taking his time refining his flow and his sound. It's a dope album. This isn't the original concept and the sample is probably off the OG Yams. Nonetheless, it's a dope LP. If A$AP gets sick of what he has come up with, I'm sure he'll come up with something original. Just my two cents.

2. Waka Flocka Flame – Waka Flocka Flame

The third installment to Waka's Waka Flocka Flame series is a dope one. His first two efforts were some of the best hip hop albums of all time. This one is no different. His flow is absolutely incredible. It is just a shame that he hasn't yet managed to make a video. I'm sure in a few years he can. Either way, it is all great.

1. Lil Herb – Lil Herb

A short list this, but in my eyes, none were as strong or as good as Lil Herb's 2013 album. "Bitch I'm in the Way" is the best song on the album and the best example of what the West Coast can do. He does everything, is extremely diverse, and is just dope. His delivery sounds like a mixture of Future, A$AP Rocky, and Yung Lean. The rest of his album is on point as well. For a producer of his caliber, the album is pretty hard to put down.

But for a minority of marchers, Pride on the West Side is also a parade from hell this year.

"If it was up to me, we would have been out here in the streets this week with our rainbow armbands," said a man named Tom, who identified himself as straight. "But I don't feel safe. We have to be very careful."

Tom, who was taking photos for a blog post on the plight of LGBTQ New Yorkers, noted that he had never seen a homophobic anti-gay comment on television or in the newspaper. In response to a suggestion that he wear a hat, he said, "You know I can't do that anyway."

It was more of the same at the beginning of the parade Friday with several hundred participants holding signs that warned: "Gay hate is the new racism."

Bernard claimed that she last saw the comedian at the "Cosby Show" studios in 1992, where he told her, "As far as I'm concerned

 … this is a piece of ass."

After being drugged, raped and threatened, Bernard said she was instructed to stay by Cosby's side in his dressing room, where she tried to shake him awake by screaming, "You're a rapist, you little bastard!"

She claims that the actor began to remove his clothes, and she was able to jump him and break free of his hold by rolling away on a chair. She said he had a hard time breathing and kept trying to kiss her. She finally escaped, but not before he had strangled her.

Bernard said she told one of the producers who had been assigned to watch her, but was told to "keep it together."

Bernard claimed that after a few weeks of struggling, she sought professional help for panic attacks and depression.

"I don't know if I can continue with the show. I am depressed today and I feel like I'm going to go crazy. In the back of my mind, I say to myself, How do I survive this? How do I go on?"

Lorena Bobbitt

"The Cosby Show" (1992)

Date of Alleged Assault – August 1992

Date of Accuser – July 2, 2016

Bill Cosby was acquitted of sexual assault charges on May 15, 2015, after the defense said the comedian had acted in self defense after being accused of drugging and assaulting model and stripper Lorena Bobbitt.

Bobbitt, 43, was at his home in Westchester County in January 1991 when Cosby drugged her. He allegedly told her that he was taking her on a romantic, five-day trip. After arriving in the Midwest, Bobbitt woke to find Cosby in bed beside her, naked with his hand over her mouth and penis up in her face. "You have the most beautiful voice" Cosby told Bobbitt, according to Bobbitt's testimony. Bobbitt alleges that her life was changed forever when Cosby gave her prescription drugs that rendered her unable to remember any of their encounter.

Following the verdict, Bobbitt's legal team issued a statement saying, "We are pleased with the outcome of this case and look forward to a long and productive reconciliation with Dr. Cosby. We are confident, however, that the jury's verdict will serve as a reminder that the victims of this tragedy must remain united in their shared determination to protect other women from similar attacks."

Gloria Allred, who is representing the Cosby team at the upcoming trial, released a statement confirming Bobbitt had appeared at a press conference with Barbara Bowman and Patricia Wenner, who have made similar claims. Allred's statement confirmed that the woman from the 1990s was "unable to remember anything" after being "drunk, high on drugs or having sex" with the comedian.

Hoda Kotb

Kotb, who appeared in three episodes of "The Cosby Show," told The Washington Post that in 1997, after a party, Cosby drugged her drink and woke her up during sex, making her "unconscious." Afterward, Kotb alleges that Cosby, "in an aggressive way," had sex with her.

Kotb told The Washington Post that she is afraid that if she goes public about the assault, Cosby will destroy her image by making it seem as if she engaged in pre-existing drug-using behavior.

"It's like nothing happened [to me]," Kotb told reporters. "Like somebody took a sledgehammer to my life that I did not know about, that just happened."

Harris, a black actor, is suing Cosby, alleging he molested his then 16-year-old sister Stephanie.

"He told her she was beautiful and that he had a crush on her…. In his words, 'I want to know everything about you. I want to hear about your family. I want to know about your family,'" he adds.

As part of an agreement with Harris and his lawyer Gloria Allred, Cosby agreed to a $100,000 cash settlement with his sister.

"On a number of occasions when I was a teenager in the 1980s to 1992, Bill Cosby repeatedly sexually assaulted me. I have been working as a photographer for almost 20 years and in that time I had never in all the years that I worked with artists and directors heard of, nor was I ever told about that which happened to me. I came forward with my story for the purpose of exposing this historical injustice. My purpose and the purpose of telling my story is to try and shed light on a problem which is still ongoing in this country which has been going on for decades," Iñarritu told Deadline in an interview for his feature documentary, "The Other Side Of Bill Cosby."

"I can do nothing about what has happened, and I'm not going to take any of that on as I don't have the legal right to. But I am going to use this medium to make amends to the person I am so damaged by, and to the people who have harmed me."<|endoftext|>1.1.2 - Bug fixes & performance improvements

"The Cosby Show" series creator Bill Cosby denies rape allegations in deposition. Read more here.

Cosby was found not guilty on all counts by a 2005 federal jury following his retrial by Pennsylvania judge Steven T. O'Neill of his indecent assault charges. In 1999, Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison for sexual assault, related to a former Temple University employee Andrea Constand. In a 2015 deposition that was released in response to a lawsuit filed by Constand, Cosby made similar allegations against Bernard in an early day motion for a new trial.

Kristina Ruehli

13. Kristina Ruehli

Date of Alleged Assault – 1983

Date of Accusation – September 2014

On September 22, 2014, Ruehli, an actress on the sitcom series "The Bill Cosby Show" for two seasons, went public with allegations against the comic. Ruehli, who is known for a role on the 1960s sitcom "The Beverly Hillbillies," claimed in a blog post that she became friends with Cosby when she was 13 years old and after that he made sexual advances towards her.

The accusations were made in a press conference at which she also shared a photo of herself that was taken during this alleged visit to Cosby's Los Angeles home in 1983. Ruehli said that at first Cosby tried to give her a glass of black coffee, and later asked her to come inside his home, where they ate dinner and he gave her a prescription for medication for night sweats. She claimed that he gave her a prescription for Valium instead, and as they chatted he allegedly fondled her. She said the alleged rape happened at Cosby's apartment after he was done with her.

She alleged that Cosby, whom she had not met before that fateful visit to his home, then invited her to go to the hotel to spend the night. She said that "The Cosby Show" production assistant called her to tell her that they'd already booked her a room, and she was left alone to discuss her flight arrangements, which she did before she arrived.

Ruehli said that while staying at his house she heard footsteps down a hallway behind her, and then she woke up the next morning to the smell of his perfumed body.

The same day, the comedian went on his own radio show and described the allegations against him as "totally false" and a "complete fabrication" on "Howard Stern."

The day after the radio interview, "Cosby Show co-founder" Marty Weiss denied Ruehli was ever in a hotel with Cosby in Los Angeles.

Ruehli was reportedly subpoenaed in the case of Andrea Constand, who accused the comedian of sexually assaulting her. In the aftermath of Constand's accusation, the Los Angeles district attorney's office dropped all charges against Cosby, and Constand dropped hers. In April 2015, Constand settled a civil case against Cosby for an undisclosed sum.

On September 30, 2015, Cosby reached a confidential settlement with a woman whom he allegedly assaulted in a hotel room in 2004.

Ruehli's lawyer said he would not make any further comments on the Cosby scandal.

Lili Bernard had a guest role on "The Cosby Show" from 1990 until 1993, when she was replaced by another actress. After the cast gathered at his Upper East Side apartment to share stories about him during pre-taping, Cosby said, "Now you're all going to go back to work after dinner," and then told Bernard, "You know … I have an idea for a show. I want you to be a part of it."

According to Bernard, she was taken to a room by a male friend of Cosby, where he offered her a drink, saying, "We should do our version of 'Dancing with the Stars.'" Bernard recalled that she felt drowsy after the drink, and woke about an hour later to find Cosby in bed with her. She said that he had raped her while she was passed out.

Date of Alleged Assault – 1982

Date of Accusation – February 1, 2016

McDaniel claimed she was drugged and raped by "The Cosby Show" star, whom she had served as a "guest actress" on two seasons.

McDaniel alleged that she first met Cosby during "The Cosby Show" and was thrilled to learn that he had produced a sitcom with Tom Joad on CBS. After the sitcom had finished its regular run, "Cosby called and invited me to stay with him," she said. As we reported in December 2015, Cosby was being sued for allegedly sexually assaulting 13 women.

According to a 2004 People magazine profile penned by McDaniel, "On weekends, I would spend about a half hour with him, reading and watching television."

McDaniel, then 32, recalled that while she was with Cosby, she "wouldn't even think of saying, 'I love you.' So he told me, 'I have to tell you something. One day soon, you're going to wake up and realize you love me even more than you've ever loved anyone in your life. Don't worry about that. The time and day will happen, we'll have children and we'll get divorced – or I'll give you a divorce and we'll make up and live happily ever after.'"

While she was drugged and raped by Cosby, he allegedly said, "I need another drink." McDaniel recalled that she woke up, drenched in Cosby's cum, to find herself in bed with him, who was standing at the foot of the bed.

Guss said that she met Cosby in 1970 to perform in a "Midsomer Murders"-themed skit for NBC and was sexually assaulted and raped by the comedian at his Atlantic City home in 1974.

"Cosby's assistant gave me marijuana and asked me to come to his bedroom," Guss said. "There, Cosby molested me until I passed out. I woke up in a cold sweat and realized something was wrong," she told reporters.

Cosby has been accused of assaulting dozens of women across the United States. In an October 2014 deposition given in a sexual assault lawsuit, the comedian denied ever sexual assaulting anyone. His lawyers claimed Guss was lying in the deposition and she is "just looking for attention." An April 2015 settlement was reached regarding an allegation by a former Temple University employee.

 results but Joc Pederson looks like a winner


12) New York Mets: If things break right, the Mets could jump several notches by the end of the season. They have a broad group of solid prospects, particularly on the pitching side, beginning with potential ace Noah Syndergaard but extending beyond him with Rafael Montero and Jake DeGrom, and that's just at Las Vegas.


13) Baltimore Orioles: A solid mid-rank system anchored by two potential number one starters in Dylan Bundy and Kevin Gausman, with Hunter Harvey and Eduardo Rodriguez also standing out. Hitting is weaker, but first baseman Christian Walker could be having a breakout season in Double-A.


14) Cincinnati Reds: Like the Orioles, a solid mid-rank system with impact talents Robert Stephenson and Jesse Winker the big names to watch, plus breakout right-hander Ben Lively. There are some intriguing potential role players as well.


15) Toronto Blue Jays: This system could leap several spots by the end of the year headlined by Marcus Stroman, Daniel Norris, and Alex Sanchez. The position side is quite toolsy but has high bust potential. Watch Low-A third baseman Mitch Nay closely.

16) Arizona
==================== COMPLETION 161 ====================
 Diamondbacks: A huge group, really dominated by the pitching trio of Robbie Ray, Shelby Miller, and Andrew Chafin. But they've got lots of good arms in the system as well.


17) Los Angeles Dodgers: A huge group overall, led by Brett Anderson, Alex Wood, and Carlos Frias. The first round is also loaded, led by L.A.'s high-upside high schooler Jaxson de Vries, as well as the top international talent in this year's draft in righty Julio Urias.


18) Texas Rangers: The Rangers have some exciting young pitching but they're very thin in the middle-round, which could hinder their odds at landing impact arms.


19) Miami Marlins: Another high-powered system with some interesting arms at high levels. The bullpen includes the likes of Matt Bush and Casey McGehee, while Chris Powell and Matt Manning will be strong late innings weapons.


20) Washington Nationals: They have excellent pitchers in Tanner Roark, Joe Ross, and Michael A. Taylor and a lot of depth in lower levels. However, the system doesn't have a top overall prep arms such as Julio Urias or Mark Appel, and pitching graduations could hurt their odds of landing some impact arms.


21) Baltimore Orioles: This is a top ten system in terms of overall ranking, with tons of pitching talent led by Matt Wieters and Kevin Gausman. They've also got other intriguing arms in Blake Swihart, Mychal Givens, and Hunter Harvey.


22) Houston Astros: This top three system, especially with Carlos Correa, Mark Appel, and Nick Tropeano on board, is very good, led by the three aforementioned starting pitching trio. I do wonder if the organization as a whole will be over-drafted.


23) St. Louis Cardinals: The Cards' system is deep and deep. There's not too many holes but they look like they'll have a difficult time picking off value prospects. The system is pretty strong overall but does the bullpen have room to grow?


24) Chicago Cubs: I don't think it's a coincidence they look primed to make a real run this year. They're stocked with top international talent from the last two international signing periods, including the No. 1 overall talent Javier Baez and the Nos. 2, 7 and 8 overall prospects.


25) Minnesota Twins: Twins fans are really looking forward to a strong year. There's not much depth here but there's enough here to have a shot to make an impact if they do get things right for their pitching staff.


26) Tampa Bay Rays: The Rays don't have a ton of pitching depth but they do have Jake Odorizzi and Alex Cobb, and a good collection of infielders from top to bottom.

The changes include more action, less comedy, a different villain and some much-needed plot adjustments. But it's still the classic TNG style you know and love, so don't cry as these changes might be a little too rough for some.

One of the main complaints about the first installment — the series premiere is in fact the original broadcast version of the pilot. Although this was a clever decision on the writers' part, it's hard to be too upset when this was the only original version of the pilot that was considered. The other series premieres — season one, two and three — were created by Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams. However, the original pilot still ran and was used as a pilot for all other Star Trek productions. So, if you really liked the first one and need to see it. You'll need to watch the second season.

The original story premise was that the Federation used time travel to travel back in time, stopping a potential time war that would have seen the destruction of the entire universe. The main character, Harry Mudd (William Shatner) became involved as a scientist who went back in time as a result of his meddling. In the movie, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) goes back and changes it so he is the one to see a future where Mudd is the one who changes history. The story was the catalyst behind the franchise.

Star Trek's reboot took place just five years after Star Wars debuted in 1977, and the movie was very much a product of the times. The movie is considered one of the scariest in the Star Trek universe. In fact, the only scene that was removed was the opening scene in which an evil and murderous Riker and Picard duel. The original version of the movie also included the scene where the Enterprise crew is forced to abandon the planet after a malfunction on their ship and a meteoroid collides with the planet.<|endoftext|>This is the third part of a four-part series about how the Internet of Things (IoT) is changing the landscape for both the businesses and users of the Internet (and the planet).

18) Minnesota Twins: Their top prospect, Miguel Sano, hit .282/.333/.471 in his first month in Double-A which was good enough to get the club to pick at 29 overall. And their top prospect Miguel Sano hit .282/.333/.471 in his first month in Double-A which was good enough to get the club to pick at 29 overall. And their top prospect Jorge Polanco , who was taken in the 11th round this year has a 1.6-win season and is on track for an MVP-type season.

19) New York Mets: The Mets' system is a mix of top-end talent such as Wilmer Flores, Matt Harvey, Jon Niese . . . who gets picked up for a third straight year . . . and guys like Carlos Frias who's still on his way to Triple-A. But you know where the system is.


20) Pittsburgh Pirates: Pittsburgh's system is strong. You have the obvious Pirates prospects such as Tyler Glasnow, Jameson Taillon and John Buck . . . and then you've got plenty more such as Josh Bell, Josh Bell, Josh Bell, and Josh Bell. . . and the list of guys to hit .250 and above in High-A is relatively short.

21) Miami Marlins: The Marlins have a solid collection of young pitching and some big-name prospects, including Mark Buehrle and Wei-Yin Chen . . . who's getting picked up for a third straight year.


22) New York Yankees: The Yankees have the worst starting pitching in the sport and a good number of them don't look like starters yet. This system is a bit like that of Texas Rangers and they have the fewest impact prospects of any major league club.


23) Texas Rangers: The Rangers have an intriguing group of potential stars with many players in Double-A or Triple-A. And they're deep in position players at both levels. There's not anything to jump up for Texas, and there aren't many players to get down from.

24) Oakland Athletics: This is a bit of a "best of all worlds" situation for A's fans. The Athletics have a solid group of high-upside players, especially on the field. But they've also acquired quite a number of players coming off the disabled list and may get those guys back sooner than later. They might not crack the top 25 at the end of the year.

25) Los Angeles Dodgers: This probably is a bit more of a bottom-of-the-pack system than the Dodgers' overall reputation implies and it's not without its bright spots. Corey Seager has gone from a prospect with some question marks to a potential All-Star. There are other young stars who look like future stars who haven't gone to the majors yet such as Julio Urias.

26) Philadelphia Phillies: The Phillies may have the worst outfield in baseball with the combination of Ryan Howard and J.P. Crawford in the middle and Ike Davis on the outside but they have the makings of a very good system full of young players who can play all three outfield positions.


27) San Diego Padres

 results but Joc Pederson looks like a winner


12) New York Mets: If things break right, the Mets could jump several notches by the end of the season. They have a broad group of solid prospects, particularly on the pitching side, beginning with potential ace Noah Syndergaard but extending beyond him with Rafael Montero and Jake DeGrom, and that's just at Las Vegas.


13) Baltimore Orioles: A solid mid-rank system anchored by two potential number one starters in Dylan Bundy and Kevin Gausman, with Hunter Harvey and Eduardo Rodriguez also standing out. Hitting is weaker, but first baseman Christian Walker could be having a breakout season in Double-A.


14) Cincinnati Reds: Like the Orioles, a solid mid-rank system with impact talents Robert Stephenson and Jesse Winker the big names to watch, plus breakout right-hander Ben Lively. There are some intriguing potential role players as well.


15) Toronto Blue Jays: This system could leap several spots by the end of the year headlined by Marcus Stroman, Daniel Norris, and Alex Sanchez. The position side is quite toolsy but has high bust potential. Watch Low-A third baseman Mitch Nay closely.

16) Arizona
==================== COMPLETION 164 ====================
 Diamondbacks: The top-notch talent is here with top prospect James Russell, and another top prospect, A.J. Pollock, looks ready for Double-A. The pitching is good and young, particularly Sean Newcomb. The defense could use some work but the top-10 talent is all here.

17) Los Angeles Dodgers: Top prospect Yasiel Puig continues to impress, as do the outfield prospects, including Carl Crawford, Justin Turner, and Andre Ellington. The pitching staff is quite good in short order, led by Alex Wood, Alex Wood, Alex Wood, Jharel Cotton, and Josh Fields. The defense has to get better, but there's talent here if the coaching staff can get it together.

18) San Francisco Giants: The Giants have a deep and talented system anchored by Yoenis Cespedes, Matt Duffy, Brandon Crawford, Brandon Belt, Brandon Crawford, and Jarrett Parker. The bullpen has a lot of potential but needs time.


19) St. Louis Cardinals: The Cardinals have a few good prospects here that could make big strides over the summer, especially with Carlos Martinez, Matt Bowman, Joe Kelly, and Kyle Lohse among those high on the list this season. The outfield has some big names but needs some work as well. The offense is still very young so there's a lot of potential here.

20) Chicago Cubs: Kyle Hendricks, Kris Bryant, and Miguel Montero are all top-15 prospects, but it comes down to Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester for most players in the system. The pitching staff has a lot of promise as long as they can keep Lester healthy.

21) Cleveland Indians: One player jumps over the others for the Indians to make this ranking. Corey Kluber is really good. The rest of the system is good though, like third baseman Asdrubal Cabrera, first baseman Carlos Santana, and Jason Kipnis. The bullpen is good for what it is though.


* * * *<|endoftext|>As the sun was setting tonight when I first saw him, I walked up to my car to get something to put on my hair. As I stood up to pull up the front fender of my rental car, I looked down and saw this thing – a large snake, no bigger than my hand, slowly sneaking into the middle of my road. I jumped out of my car and ran as fast as I could to the top of the hill, and there he was. It looked like a big cobra, and I told my daughter to get in the back seat of the car and close the doors. I ran back down the road and called someone on my cell, to come meet me. After talking to a dispatcher several time, I picked up a cop I know and we started the drive towards the county park. I figured that if we were going to do it, we knew what to do.

The cop came to the house a couple miles away where I live, and I helped bring him out of his house, and into the car as I went inside. We started walking along our little roads, past the local farms, and through the trees until we got to the parking lot. I was in the driver's seat, and he was in the passenger side. Just as we got close enough to the lot, the cop said, "Don't put the car into park, turn it around. Turn the wheel. Turn the wheel and turn it back. Move the steering wheel." I didn't want him to be like that but he was right – we weren't going to let that snake get out or in until we got to the park. Before we reached the park, there were other vehicles in the parking lot. We turned

 their activation. Thus we have to construct more or less unsystematic hypotheses concerning the structure of primary emotion circuits, and develop computational tools to analyze them in the lab. In the following sections we review evidence that these emotional systems may comprise a kind of 'higher-order emotional system', and demonstrate how such a model provides insights into the neural mechanisms of other emotions.

Anxiety: an evolutionary model The brain's ability to detect and manipulate threat and potential danger may have evolved in an ancestral environment of intense social danger [24,49,80,81]. This need for heightened alertness may have driven more general-purpose fear systems to be evolved in parallel to the primary-process emotion systems. Given this ancestral history, it is possible that the evolutionary processes that have led to our species' enhanced capability for learning fear may also have created the neural circuits that enable more specific types of fear ( , ; see [17,43,47] for specific examples). As it would have been useful even for our ancestors, with their higher intelligence, to detect and regulate threatening situations, this would be consistent with the notion that some types of anxiety are not 'general-purpose' ( ). However, given that all of our species fear the same basic stimuli (predatory animals, predators, predators' young, predators, potential danger at any scale), it is difficult to argue that such fear can be expressed at different intensity types depending on the threat. Indeed, it is the latter type of anxiety often thought to reflect a particular problem in evolution, namely 'fear of vulnerability' (see [82,82] for an review). More recent studies suggest that general-purpose fear circuitry evolved in parallel to emotion-mediated learning by way of the secondary-process (i.e., evolved after the primary emotional systems) [27,44]. Fear responses are often thought to be triggered when external cues, in the form of threat or danger signals, become percepted. Moreover, there is a debate as to whether fear-inducing stimuli, such as loud noises or visual projections of animals in danger, also trigger an immediate activation of the secondary-process system. On the one hand, the 'vulnerability paradox' would argue that this is in fact not necessary—a danger-inducing stimulus may, in fact, trigger secondary processing, thereby providing information about the threat's source and therefore helping to protect the organism [27] or providing an opportunity to learn a relevant skill in the context of the individual challenge [83]. On the other hand, another argument would be that the threat might be sufficiently salient that the processing of it is not necessary in an emergency situation. One might then argue that fear is a form of self-regulation, that it allows the individual to reduce their own risk by controlling their response, and thereby indirectly reducing the potential harm to others [83]. This view is consistent with the notion that a critical feature of anxiety is that it is based on perceptions, which require the ability to interpret or understand threat events—i.e., they require 'emotional intelligence' [32]. As such, anxiety should be considered to be a primary-process emotion, at least in a very general sense. We will return to this notion in Section 4. Open in a separate window The idea of a more specific secondary-process circuitry that integrates threat and fearful events is more controversial [27,44,83–85]. Such a model may lead to a similar conclusion as that of the vulnerability-paradox, namely that fear does not have a universal component, but rather varies across individuals based on their level of behavioral risk-taking behavior for the specific threat [27]. Indeed, a similar idea has been proposed for fear in non-human animals [34–40], suggesting that different brain circuits should be involved across species in different

 them. For example, we are not presently able to disentangle basic 'emotion primacy' or 'emotion-deficit' networks, nor the network or 'process' that underlies the emotional response to one's own name (i.e., a primitive, primitive feeling state like love). We also can't tell whether primitive affective networks like pain, fear, anger, and disgust arise from primordial, primordial sub-neural circuits in the first place. In either case it seems unlikely that our understanding of such primordial sub-neural circuits can be easily decoded in a laboratory, though that may be changing with new tools like fMRI and magnetoencephalography. That all these emotions are tightly interrelated in the brain is a testament to the remarkable complexity of brain systems of emotion and learning to support evolutionary complexity itself (Saxe & Aron, 2012). It is not enough simply to say that a particular emotion-state is 'primally evolved' because it has been so extensively explored, for example, fear and disgust. If so, then what kind of primitive emotion? How deep into the evolutionary past can we reconstruct primitive emotion-states? In other words, what type of primitive circuits are under discussion in functional evolutionary theories as being fundamental? There is a long and rather ugly lineage of evolutionary psychology theories based largely on the hypothesis that most human traits and behaviours are driven by primary-process states (Wickens, 2000), and that emotions are the result, if not the origin, of neural activity in a specific brain region, which then has its downstream consequence within the body. To many, this view appears to explain a large number of 'primitive' emotion functions (e.g. fear, disgust, sadness) on a one off basis, and is not considered sufficiently evolutionary-compatible (Stalnaker, 1998, 2011). This view often leaves one open to the question: what would an evolutionary functional neuroanatomy look like, and how would we then understand how these brain regions may have evolved? To avoid such a blind jump, here we will follow a different path, by taking a broader perspective of the evolutionary development of emotion. We argue that emotional processes evolved from neural circuits (in much the same pattern, but more complex than that already studied by evolutionary evolutionary psychologists). As a consequence of their evolutionary success, the mammalian brain may have been able to store much greater amounts of emotions as a result—even many more complex than those most widely studied by contemporary evolutionary psychologists. We call these higher level emotional processes emotional metaplasticity. These metaplasticity processes may have played a role in shaping the complexity in higher level emotional systems as they evolved later. For example, metaplasticity appears to have enabled the evolution of 'complex social behaviour' or to foster 'human-like' emotion or awareness at higher levels of brain organization (Bateson, 1996; Buss & Zanna, 2010; Gazzaniga & Keltner, 2010). In a similar way, these higher level emotional processes may have played a role in the evolution of complex affective states, or at least in their emergence (Keltner, 2013; Keltner and Gazzaniga, 2013); for example, the emergence of 'aesthetic appreciation' or appreciation by 'gut feelings' (Keltner, 2012; Lefebvre, 2012) and the emergence of 'fear emotions' (Keltner, 2009). However, how did this evolution of such complex affective states occur? And how can such affective states be studied? By combining evolutionary theories of brain evolution with current neuroscience, we hope to make sense of this evolutionary change in an evolutionary neuroscience framework. By working within this framework, we are able

 them. The only way to characterize them is via evolutionary modeling that would capture their hierarchical function. To achieve this, it is not necessary to try to discover their functional homologues in the more recent and less-finely-tuned secondary-process systems. Rather, evolutionary modeling could usefully investigate functional homologies between primitive or primordial, subdividable or primitive-like emotions and their more highly-tuned, higher order counterparts. In particular, primordial emotions could be interpreted from the psychological point of view as "primitive behavioral modules," the way mammals may classify basic motor functions. These primitive/primitive-like emotions may also capture some of the key components of higher-order emotions and "higher-level" cognitive functions based on "extended emotions"—i.e., their functional or psychological similarities to emotions, emotions' functional homologies to higher cognitive functions, and the ability of such emotions to influence (impose) "control," in evolutionary terms. Thus, primordial emotions may provide a very clear and direct target for evolutionary study, by focusing attention on a level of the psychological function of the basic emotion which has not been studied before (i.e., higher-order functions). A similar view can be seen in the study of language. We use a "primitive-level language" (e.g., the use of a single-word construct, such as "dog") to describe behaviors that appear at or below the level of higher-order behavioral modules (e.g., the use of non-verbal communication in daily life) (Tversky and Kahneman, 1985). The very same language, a single-word construct with a very simple meaning, is used frequently in our daily lives to describe basic, "immediate" perceptual experiences (e.g., the perception of a red face with red eyes). Our primitive language, which is clearly a primitive "primitive-level communication mechanism" (see review by Wainwright, 1992) makes a great deal of intuitive sense (with a limited number of words), yet does not yield a large database of meaning. Yet, just as the primitive concept of "dog" is a primitive-level biological biological behavior, the same may be said about most everyday concepts—even basic emotional concepts (e.g., a "bad feeling" for fear or "love" for liking). Primitive concepts may serve the functional role to guide and interpret the behavioral expression of higher levels. They may be necessary for the survival of primitive species (as a "primitive-language" would enable them to survive). This could be true for the evolutionary basis of much higher-order behavioral functions—e.g., for the control of aggression and even for the control of social behavior. It would also indicate, if not already established, that evolution may have "re-arranged" the emotional/behavioral hierarchy to reflect more-complex levels of behavior than any that were available before—thus, for example, higher (e.g., more advanced) emotions may have existed at a very early stage of human evolution. Indeed, even the idea of an ancestral "soul consciousness" may be a primitive concept—a sort of "primitive language," with only a subset of words in it, that is used only in primitive societies. In short, it would appear that the primitive-level emotions are the "primitives" whose use can be explained by evolutionary modeling of their function. In the future, we may be able to learn a great deal more about the functions of our primitive emotions, as evolutionary modeling gives us the opportunity to see them from the behavioral point of view. This level of modeling offers the potential to uncover the biological underpinnings of emotions' higher-order functions, and perhaps the function of

 them yet. Although evolutionary evidence supports two main alternative strategies to decode primary-process emotions, both of them are very slow, thus making them limited for the present purposes. The first strategy uses an extensive collection of well-known and well-established experimental paradigms, each of which is considered capable of revealing the primary-process emotions (e.g., emotional 'labels') that underlie the behavioral responses seen (e.g., fear, anger, disgust, envy, sadness, anxiety). Some examples of such widely-studied and highly-used paradigms may be presented below that could be broadly used for extracting primary-process emotions from behavioral responses. However, for now we restrict ourselves to three examples, each of which, to our knowledge, represents a powerful tool for uncovering the primal emotional circuits relevant to animal behavior. We use four main concepts to describe these three studies. The concept of a neural network in emotional neuroscience The first and most general concept of our study is that of a neural network in emotion neuroscience. The neural network is usually defined as a set of brain regions that generate certain types of behavioral responses (i.e., stimuli). Each of these regions can be subdivided into subnetworks that constitute a network in its own right. Each of these subnetworks can be further subdivided, and some of them further subdivided further, creating whole networks—that is, neural networks—that can perform a multitude of cognitive functions. Such networks can even be hierarchical—in other words, can be composed of multiple levels (e.g., a single set of neural subnets can also consist of multiple, nested subnetworks), which are referred to as 'levels'. Figure 7 illustrates an example of a neural network that might be broadly conceived to encode primary-process emotions (see for further examples). Open in a separate window In this example, the neural network has three sets of neural subnetworks—the first subnetwork, the second subnetwork, and the third—that all together constitute a whole brain network, and all three of these neural subnets may also be referred to by a single name: "Emotion." The subnetworks (the neural networks) are also called "fear" or "emotional processing" subnets, or simply "fear" or "fear-processing" subnetworks. Thus, the neural network in Figure 4 represents the primal emotion circuitry that enables us to be scared, enraged, and fearful. The fear circuitry in Figure 5 contains three sets of fear regions: one for the dorsal-ventral complex (i.e., regions that process fear), one for medial-lateral cortex (i.e., regions involved in perceiving and encoding fear), and one for the midline brainstem regions that transmit fear. The second network of Figure 6 is a set of regions that process anger. In the example of this figure, the anger circuitry consists of one set of anger regions and one set of regions that process disgust (i.e., regions involved in disgust) (see for further examples). Figure 8 shows another way to think about these networks: they're made up of two interconnected sets of regions (the fear and anger circuitry), and all three of the networks are in the same brain region (subcortical gray matter circuitry that connects ventral and dorsal sides of the brain, i.e., the amygdala). In this way, two sets of interconnected brain regions give rise to a neural network whose goal it is to encode different types of behavioral responses. The central-process (or primordial) emotion circuitry This second broad concept of our study is that of a general neural network that is capable of generating primary-process emotions (e.g., fear, anger, and disgust, etc).

Heterogeneous Memory Management Is Maturing, AMDGPU Support Coming For the past four years now we have been monitoring the development of Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM) for allowing the mirroring of process address spaces and other functionality particularly designed around modern GPU compute needs but also applicable to other devices/drivers. The HMM kernel code was merged to mainline last year while haven't seen much activity by the DRM drivers but that now seems to be changing. 28 September 04:36 AM EDT - Linux Kernel - Heterogeneous Memory Management

There's A New Libre GPU Effort Building On RISC-V, Rust, LLVM & Vulkan Over the past decade and a half of covering the Linux graphics scene, there have been many attempts at providing a fully open-source GPU (or even just display adapter) down to the hardware level, but none of them have really panned out from Project VGA to other FPGA designs. There's a new very ambitious project trying to create a "libre 3D GPU" built atop RISC-V, leveraging Rust and LLVM on the software side, and would also support Vulkan. 28 September 12:09 AM EDT - Hardware - Very Ambitious Libre GPU

 late penalty looked like it would give the Blues the halftime lead, before the champs struck with that all-important score on the south side of halftime.

West added two more penalties put the Blues back in front, 26-24, after a tightly contested third quarter, and then this delicious contest was decided right around the 70-minute mark with a little bit of controversy.

First Osborne was yellow-carded for an incorrect ruck entry. Fair call, but had Malakai Fekitoa been hit high earlier in the play?

Regardless, the Blues punished the southerners from the very next play. The touchline was sought, replacement halfback Billy Guyton gobbled up some territory and then from a ruck big Tuipulotu charged over for a contentious, but match-winning try. There might have been some off-the-ball interference, but not as the TMO saw it.

The Highlanders had the final say, but Ben Smith's late score for the visitors proved consolation only as the Blues walked off with the win they needed, not to mention the welcome sound of their fans' applause in their ears.

The deal comes as part of the company's new One Touch Friends program, a special program in which customers can get their friends to bring their phones with them to shop for the HTC One at AT&T.

You can view a full list of the AT&T One Friends program here.

The AT&T One is available as an unlocked model running the latest Android 4.1 Jelly Bean software, and packs a 1.7GHz dual-core OMAP 4460 chip on-board. It has 8GB of internal storage, and it is powered by a 2,500 mAh battery. There is a 13MP camera up front, and it comes with an 1,900 mAh battery.

We'll be keeping a close eye on pricing and availability of the HTC One throughout June.

UPDATE: After seeing this news, we decided to perform a price check on the HTC One under contract from Verizon, in the new unlocked configuration. As it turns out, the device is now $50 cheaper than it was before.

UPDATE #2: AT&T is also offering a $50/month discount for its Unlimited Freedom plan.

The UN resolution on the settlements, drafted by Egypt and sponsored by New Zealand, passed 18-7 with the US abstaining, giving the measure global support.

READ MORE: Israel 'will not accept UN vote on West Bank settlements'

Egypt and the Palestinian Authority, which both supported the resolution, accused Israel of failing to halt the construction of a new settlement building in the occupied West Bank.

The statement said, "The Security Council deplores the continued construction of illegal settlements, which are illegal under international law, on land not included in prior agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, including East Jerusalem."

After the vote, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's office said he was "surprised, disappointed and disappointed" about the vote, calling on the international community "to show courage and take concrete steps" to help restore negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, which have been stalled since 2007.

Israel said in a statement, "We will respond at the appropriate time and in the appropriate forum: in the courts of justice, or elsewhere."

The resolution, which was proposed by the UN's Palestinian special envoy Nickolay Mladenov and supported by Jordan, passed despite Israel's objections as well as the US abstaining.

According to AFP, Mladenov said the Palestinian resolution is "the first step toward a comprehensive settlement of the vexed questions" of the status of Jerusalem, the fate of the vast majority of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, refugees and Palestinian refugees.

"That's the reality for which we all must act," he said, "We have been forced by our own governments to do this - in a few months."<|endoftext|>Welcome to my first

The study was published in Neurobiology of Disease.

Slow wave sleep occurs when a person is in deep sleep. It is generally believed to be necessary for normal cognitive and cognitive functions.

Slow wave sleep provides a restful, non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep during which the body shuts down non-brain related activities. During NREM sleep there are several types of REM (rapid-eye movement) sleep. The most common REM is slow wave, which happens during a period of deep sleep. During slow wave sleep, the brain does not initiate movement, which reduces anxiety.

Although slow wave sleep was thought to promote growth of new nerve cells, little was known about its effects. In the new study, researchers collected neurophysiological recordings from 24 patients undergoing surgery to implant electrodes. This enabled them to measure changes in brain activity during different stages of slow wave sleep.

The scientists found that the growth of new nerve cells is influenced by a slow wave sleep stage (SWS-S1) that occurs during deep sleep.

The researchers also showed in a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience that when slow wave sleep is interrupted, nerve cell growth is impaired in certain regions of the brain. The authors speculate that the lack of SWS-S1 during sleep deprivation may contribute to the growth of brain tumors.

"Nerve cell growth is dependent upon a variety of factors associated with growth and differentiation," said first author of both papers, Sarah M. Schleske, Ph.D. "The authors suggest that SWS-S1 is an important factor that may not only play a role in nerve cell growth during sleep deprivation, but could also be responsible for impairing nerve cell growth caused from many different types of sleep deprivation. Although slow wave sleep certainly has many different properties, SWS-S1 seems to be one of the key ways slow wave sleep helps regulate other functions of the brain."

The researchers believe their findings could have significant practical implications. They believe that improving sleep can greatly impact an individual's ability to control certain behaviors such those that occur in chronic fatigue and obesity. Improving sleep is also associated with decreased risks of stroke and diabetes, and increasing overall quality of life and overall health.

Dr. Schleske added, "People who develop brain tumors are often obese, and in particular people who have gained a lot of weight tend to have the highest risk for developing brain tumors. It might be possible for the brain tumor risk to be lowered if people who have brain tumors lose a lot of weight. Our results may give some idea of what we need to do to reduce brain tumor risk by reducing the risk of developing obesity."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 3.1 million adults in the United States have obstructive sleep apnea. Excess daytime sleepiness and frequent waking in an effort to rest are the major characteristics of sleep apnea. Approximately 3.1 million adults are obese, and obesity contributes greatly to the health risks of developing a brain tumor. Although obesity is linked to increased risk of cancer, it is also known to contribute to numerous other health issues.

Lead author of one of the study articles, David F. Ritzman, D.Phil., M.P.H., Professor of Psychology at Duke, commented, "Obesity is an independent risk factor for a broad host of

While it's not clear why this is a conflict, Russia has recently made it easier for oil and gas drilling to move through Russia and was a signatory of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord.

The video was produced through the partnership between the Center for Sustainable Energy and Global Exchange, a coalition of nonprofits committed to "defending the climate and protecting the planet."

The video focuses mostly on the North Slope of Alaska's largest oil and gas fields and shows images, like the ongoing construction of a pipeline over a river, as well as oil and gas rigs, drill pad flares, fire trucks, and firefighters on the scene. We see images from the Alaska Resource Data Center and an "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" press release from 2015 on how climate change is threatening Russia's interests in Alaska.

We see some striking images of a Russian fire truck that appears to be burning something green and burning another fire truck which appears to be burning what looks like gasoline. A man dressed all in black walks by, with blood on his face and is on fire. We see the Russian words "Borat" and "I've been there" printed on the side of a truck. In another piece of imagery, we see the words "The War Begins" written across a mountain.

The video was edited well and had a good amount of visuals to work with. The graphics were clear, the video was well presented, and there were a lot of great interviews. It's fair to say that this video was quite well produced.

Unfortunately, many climate activists are less than impressed with the way this documentary was made. Earth First! is a self-described anarcho-syndicalist group whose members want to abolish the human race in order to bring about "a world of abundance with an ecological balance." They do, however, make sense in the context of this video, considering that the U.S., Russia, and many other nations on the global stage share similar positions on a few key issues.

If you look at the map of U.S. policy on Arctic resources provided in the video, you can see that it is actually quite consistent with the position of the U.S. on issues of Arctic energy development. We see Alaska as a territory of the U.S., our own land mass in a far flung land. This is consistent with the position of the U.S. as the wealthiest nation in the world with billions of dollars to spend on Arctic projects if it wishes to expand U.S. interests in the Arctic. It's interesting to see that the U.S. is trying to protect its interests in the Arctic while other nations of the world are expanding their interests in the region.

There have been several notable incidents in recent months about Russia's Arctic drilling activities. On August 12, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) arrested 14 Greenpeace activists protesting a Russian oil rig being readied for exploration activities in the Arctic Ocean off the Alaska coast. Russia seized the Greenpeace vessel, a Finn and a Norwegian national respectively. The boat departed from Germany and entered Russia on August 2, after being sent back from Sea of Okhotsk.

The Russian Navy confiscated the Greenpeace vessel on August 18, after it refused to leave Russian waters. All 13 activists were arrested on August 31 in the nearby town of Murmansk and released that day after signing confessions claiming that they were members of what they called "

TICKETING INFORMATION

The Highlanders team to play the Blues has not been finalised, but it is not expected to see many changes.

Fans can pre-register at www.ticketek.co.nz or call 03 941 373300.<|endoftext|>"We've just recently gone through this period where they're cutting back and reducing their funding for our police department," he said.

There aren't many places in the United States where the police force is so heavily scrutinized and targeted. Since the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Ferguson has become increasingly infamous, which has brought a wave of activism to the city.


As a result, the city has launched a campaign called "We the Police," which is aimed at building relationships between residents, law enforcement and the community.


On this day, the St. Louis police department held a conference call to discuss their efforts to foster trust in the community. On the call, the police chief noted that some St. Louis residents are suspicious of the police because some citizens are often seen with guns.


"With our officers we want to make sure that if you have a gun, you will have a conversation with us and not take out a weapon on us," he said.

The police chief also spoke to the idea of how the police can communicate and better reach out to those who have criminal records. He added that if criminal records prevent some from receiving an initial police stop, officers should be better prepared to provide information about them without the help of jailers.

Watch The Report


The most common reason police arrest, however, is the use of force, meaning the officers used excessive force when dealing with individuals. According to the US Department of Justice, between 9,200 and 11,200 incidents of police or citizens using force were reported in 2013.


At the same time,
======================================== SAMPLE 181 ========================================

public Magnifier() { this(ID + "0.5;2.0", null); }

The key attributes of a Decorator are its "type" and its "state." The "type" is a string that must begin with a unique character sequence (in order to be recognized by the counter factory). The sequence for the Magnifier class is given by Magnifier.ID. The rest of the "type" contains all information about the piece that is fixed at module-design time. In our case, this is the minimum and maximum magnification factor.

protected String myGetType() { return ID + minMag + ";" + maxMag; }

We also have a corresponding mySetType() method:

public void mySetType(String type) { type = type.substring(ID.length); int i = type.indexOf(";"); try { minMag = Double.parseDouble(type.substring(0,i)); } catch (NumberFormatException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } try { maxMag = Double.parseDouble(type.substring(i+1)); } catch (NumberFormatException ex) { ex.printStackTrace
==================== COMPLETION 181 ====================
(); } }

The other piece of the implementation is the "state." This is a boolean that indicates whether Magnifier is in use or not. A Decorator might need to be initialized in some way and then "destroyed" in some other way. An easy way to do this is to create an event listener on the "state" attribute and register it with the onPropertyChanged() method of the class.

public void myStart() { myState = State.normal; setState(myState, True); onPropertyChanged(); }

The endresult of all of this is that the Magnifier class can be used in four different ways:

You can use as a default decoration in any module you write: just add the class name to the first argument of decoratorDeclaringMethod(). Alternatively, you can use it directly after the decorators. Use it in a module with the getDefault() method. Use it as a decorator in a component. In a module with an @Component annotation, use myMagnifier() to use the Magnifier component.

You can have Magnifier classes in multiple modules, each with a different name. The same magnifier class can be used in multiple modules, so all your code just gets a new name.

If you want to use Magnifier in a component (or a different component depending on the configuration) that uses a specific version of Android or a specific configuration, you need to register your Magnifier in that configuration. If you want a specific configuration to work for all the modules you want a Magnifier in, you need to register it multiple times in each module. There are two ways to do this:

use the static addMagnifierConfiguration() method of your Magnifier in your component/components using the Magnifier.INSTANCE annotation.

attribute. use Android's config() method to find a default configuration that your Magnifier uses.

Use a Magnifier and an Instance of MagnifierDecorate

Using a Magnifier as a decoration can be fun, but there are some limitations. The first is that it is generally not possible to change the magnification factors in any way. So if you have a Magnifier that needs a magnification factor other than 2.1, you can't just change the value in the constructor.

Another limitation is that MagnifierDecorate requires that you know the MagnifierID. If you do not have a Magnifier with that ID, you cannot use MagnifierDecorate.

For all other purposes, you can use a native Magnifier, provided that it has the same dimensions as the native Magnifier.

The third limitation is that if you use a Magnifier without a default configuration, you must do it at compile time. If you use a custom MagnifierDecorate instance in the method that declares your MagnifierDecorate class, you must use the static initialize() method of that class to initialize the magnifier by hand at module-design time. You cannot use the instance directly. When you want to use the default configuration, it takes some work to find the MagnifierID you need.

If you are a user and want to use Magnifier as a decorator then I recommend that you do it in two ways: first in your component using the static addMagnifierConfiguration() method of your Magnifier and then in your component as a decorator using onModuleCreated() in the same method that declares your MagnifierDecorate class.

If you are a developer and you need a Magnifier that has default configuration then make sure you have the proper version of the MagnifierDecorate class and use that with your custom module.

This concludes the Magnifier Design Pattern tutorial.
======================================== SAMPLE 182 ========================================

public Magnifier() { this(ID + "0.5;2.0", null); }

The key attributes of a Decorator are its "type" and its "state." The "type" is a string that must begin with a unique character sequence (in order to be recognized by the counter factory). The sequence for the Magnifier class is given by Magnifier.ID. The rest of the "type" contains all information about the piece that is fixed at module-design time. In our case, this is the minimum and maximum magnification factor.

protected String myGetType() { return ID + minMag + ";" + maxMag; }

We also have a corresponding mySetType() method:

public void mySetType(String type) { type = type.substring(ID.length); int i = type.indexOf(";"); try { minMag = Double.parseDouble(type.substring(0,i)); } catch (NumberFormatException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } try { maxMag = Double.parseDouble(type.substring(i+1)); } catch (NumberFormatException ex) { ex.printStackTrace
==================== COMPLETION 182 ====================
(); } myGetType(); }

The "state" attribute for this decorator represents the state of a Magnifier component: (the default) it is either a "min" or a "max." In addition, it contains the minimum and/or maximal magnification values (in nanometers). This property is read only, and should be set by methods on any "decorator object" object in the application.

As you might have surmised, there is additional information about any Magnifier that is created by a Decorator: its minimum and maximum magnification factor. These are computed from the "type" and "state" attributes.

protected double minimumMagnifier() { return maxMagnifier; } protected double maximumMagnifier() { return type.value; }

To access the magnified image of some object, use the image() method. To compute the maximum and minimum magnification, use the following algorithm:

Compute the minimum and maximum magnifications from the "type" and "state" attributes. Compute the Magnification factor from the Magnification property. If the Magnification factor is smaller than the specified "Max Magnification," apply the following algorithm, otherwise: compute the maximum and minimum magnification from the attribute "type" (in order), then take the value of the Magnification property after applying the maximum magnification.

Note: The above code is intentionally simple for readability. The algorithm is not exhaustive. The Magnification property is read-only.

Finally, add the following code to your Main method to print the Magnification of each Decorator:

Dim image(10), magnifier(10); for (Image img of Magnifier()) image.setPos(1, img.getPos()); image(10).mag.toString(); magnifier.icon = image;

Run the code, and you will notice that the magnified images look like:

Margaret Thatcher's speech at the Conservative Party Conference is to be shown in cinemas for the first time.

The first ever TV movie, released in September 1955, follows the prime minister as she delivers her keynote address to the party faithful.

The film was made by the government-backed Channel 6 and runs for 85 minutes, making it the longest run of the film in British history.

It will be shown on 2 April - 25 years to the day since Thatcher became leader of the Conservative Party.

The first ever TV movie of Margaret Thatcher's prime ministerial address

The TV movie was a collaboration between Channel 6 and the government-backed film agency Groucho, created to make some of the party's most significant speeches in recent years.

Its first UK broadcast is part of BBC Worldwide's Prime Ministers' Conferences promotion.

A short clip broadcast in 1955 saw Thatcher being introduced to the country and discussing her views on the future of her party ahead of the next election.

It had its origins in a speech in June 1954 by the Conservative MP Edward Heath, who was not then leader of the party but had been invited to address the conference as a member of Mrs Thatcher's inner circle.

That week, a new programme, called Home Front, was shown and, as a result, footage of Heath's speech was taken and used to create the TV movie.

public Magnifier() { this(ID + "0.5;2.0", null); }

The key attributes of a Decorator are its "type" and its "state." The "type" is a string that must begin with a unique character sequence (in order to be recognized by the counter factory). The sequence for the Magnifier class is given by Magnifier.ID. The rest of the "type" contains all information about the piece that is fixed at module-design time. In our case, this is the minimum and maximum magnification factor.

protected String myGetType() { return ID + minMag + ";" + maxMag; }

We also have a corresponding mySetType() method:

public void mySetType(String type) { type = type.substring(ID.length); int i = type.indexOf(";"); try { minMag = Double.parseDouble(type.substring(0,i)); } catch (NumberFormatException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } try { maxMag = Double.parseDouble(type.substring(i+1)); } catch (NumberFormatException ex) { ex.printStackTrace
==================== COMPLETION 183 ====================
(); } }

We set the magnifiers at module-design time by referencing them in the "type" attribute of the constructor. As before, we return an ID (an Int) and two constants, MINMAG and MAXMAG, which we use as our counter-factors in the constructor and in update() . There are three ways to do it:

public String getType() { return ID + minMag + "-10;" + maxMag; } private static int minMag(String val) { if (val.equals("M") || val.equals("M+") || val.equals("M+2")) return minMAG; else return 10; } private static int maxMag(String val) { if (val.equals("M") || val.equals("M+") || val.equals("M+2")) return maxMAG; else return 20; }

If we were using the Java approach, we'd either have to create our own counter factory or load the value of the counter directly into the constructor. If we're not, that's a good thing, because we won't have a direct pointer to a counter variable. The Java approach is preferred under the following conditions:

The module-construction code is at most one line.

Every time we create a new Magnifier object, we have an opportunity to get a counter with a specific range of values.

Note that we do not have to use Int for the magnifier. One approach would be to use double . This would result in much longer lines of code. We need the range of values regardless of the numerical precision of the machine that implements the interface to the program.

public void myConstructor(ID did) { getType(); setType(did); }

The class constructor provides a method that sets the class's type and initializes and destroys it. The method returns void so that it's possible to execute getType() more than once per class. The code in the constructor is shown below:

protected void myConstructor(ID did) { setType(did); getType(); }

After the class is constructed, it is ready for use. The method in the above list can set, modify, and destroy Magnifier objects without calling these two methods for each object created. (Each set method and each update method will always be invoked for the object itself by the call to myConstructor(this).getType() .)

public void myUpdate(Integer id, Integer val) { int num = Integer.parseInt(val); setValue(id, num); getValue(); }

The update method receives the id and the value of the Magnifier object and sets, modifies, and destroys it as appropriate. These three code steps can be performed using any Java-compatible method with one exception: you're much more likely to want to use Java's setValue(String name, Integer value) method instead. If you want to use Java's setValue method, the code fragment shown below is preferred:

public void update(Integer id, Integer val) { int num = Integer.parseInt(val); if (id < 10) val = 10; if (id == 10) int num2 = num == 10? 10: num; Integer val2 = val > 11? val: val; val = val.subtract(id == 11 ? val2 : val2); getValue(); }

Note that Java's method is not an instance method; it doesn't take any arguments. The code in this method is much simpler and less error-prone than this one.

After all of these
======================================== SAMPLE 184 ========================================

public Magnifier() { this(ID + "0.5;2.0", null); }

The key attributes of a Decorator are its "type" and its "state." The "type" is a string that must begin with a unique character sequence (in order to be recognized by the counter factory). The sequence for the Magnifier class is given by Magnifier.ID. The rest of the "type" contains all information about the piece that is fixed at module-design time. In our case, this is the minimum and maximum magnification factor.

protected String myGetType() { return ID + minMag + ";" + maxMag; }

We also have a corresponding mySetType() method:

public void mySetType(String type) { type = type.substring(ID.length); int i = type.indexOf(";"); try { minMag = Double.parseDouble(type.substring(0,i)); } catch (NumberFormatException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } try { maxMag = Double.parseDouble(type.substring(i+1)); } catch (NumberFormatException ex) { ex.printStackTrace
==================== COMPLETION 184 ====================
(); } }

The "state" attribute specifies what value the module is expecting when the Magnifier is first started. For the above example we're wanting a value between MIN and MAX in the range of 0 to 255. Since our counter factory's getValue() method return's a Number (rather than a string), the Magnifier is forced to implement an override of the double() method. Since Magnifier is in charge of the min and max values when a Magnifier is first started, it would be appropriate to return double values in the Magnifier.State field.

When the Magnifier is started, the state is set to STARTED by default. You can also check the STATE field and set it to either STARTED, STOPED, or RESUMED.

private int STARTED;

In order to be able to specify an optional start state for the Magnifier, you can provide the STARTED attribute to the method:

public void mySetState(int state) { STARTED = state; }

If you're using an attribute-based interface in your code, you would use its getType() method instead of its getVal() method, for example:

interface IEquatable { void eval(String value); } interface IEnumerable { int filter(IEnumerable<String> source, String... values); }

The following example creates two Magnifiers, each with a STARTED value of 100 .

Magnifier start = new Magnifier(1); Magnifier stop = new Magnifier(100); System.out.print("start: "); System.out.println(start.getStarted()); System.out.print("stop: "); System.out.println(stop.getStarted()); System.out.print("

");

The output from the above code is as follows:

start: 100 stop: 100

The next example uses the above example but adds two more parameters for STARTED and STOPED .

Magnifier start = new Magnifier(1, STARTED); Magnifier stop = new Magnifier(100, STOPED); System.out.print("Start: "); System.out.println(start.getStarted()); System.out.print("Stop: "); System.out.println(stop.getStarted()); System.out.print("

");

The output from the above code is as follows:

Start: 100

The first parameter for start is 1, while the second parameter is STARTED . When the Magnifier is started, STARTED is set to be 100, so to change the STARTED state of the first Magnifier, we simply need to add a call to setState() to the start() method call. When the Magnifier is stopped, restarted, or restored after restart, our counter factory needs to check STARTED .

When your object is being created, the main attribute-based interface you're using might not have an override for the Double getValue() method. This is because double(string) returns a double value, not a string value. You'll need to add the useDouble method to get the string value to call its getValue() method. (If your interface is IEquatable , then these methods will appear in the Equatable interface instead.)

// this is a reference to the first Magnifier in our example class public class Counter { public Magnifier start; public Magnifier stop; public Counter() { } public void myGetValue(String value) { start.myGetState(0); System.out.print("value: "); System.out.println(value); } public void my

Exploring the PDF universe

My first career was in publishing. Science textbook publishing, to be precise. In my six years as an editor, I spent thousands of hours meticulously reviewing PDF book manuscripts and printer proofs.

I learned that PDFs work well for certain applications, like preparing press-ready files that a printer can use to run off 50,000 copies without having them look like cheap Xeroxes. PDFs are also good for showing you exactly how a print piece is going to look in its final format with nifty things like crop marks, spread layouts, and gutters.

Source: 13thirtyone.com

As a marketer, I've seen how PDFs also work well for content such as:

Printed brochures and other leave-behind materials

Direct mailers like postcards and one-sheets

Detailed research reports, buyer's guides, and reference materials

Long-form content for audiences with restricted Internet access

Unfortunately, it seems that many marketers, regardless of use case or audience, rely on PDFs as their default format for all their content, including e-books, white papers, case studies, and infographics. While
==================== COMPLETION 185 ====================
 PDFs are great for short runs, their default format has not evolved over the years and, in my experience, PDFs are not great for long-term retention of information about your business.

Here's why:

1. PDFs are difficult to edit.

As you know, PDFs are text-based documents. They're not editable – that means PDFs are not a great format for editing.

This is because, while you can use software to do a lot of editing and "fix up" a PDF document, there's no way to do real and full-fledged formatting changes, which means that PDFs look terrible until you've made those changes in your graphics tool of choice.

2. PDFs are not user-friendly.

This is especially unfortunate for the first time visitor to your website. No matter how great your business is, there's nothing worse than someone trying to go through your content (which is already in HTML) and see the magic you've created just by jumping to a PDF.

One good example of this would be a visitor who's just visiting to see how your website looks in PDF format, looking for tips on how to convert an eBook (which should look great in any format possible) to a website website.

3. PDFs can be difficult to manage.

When someone walks away (or worse, takes screenshots) from your website in PDF format, you need to figure out how to keep that PDF file in sync with you files and ensure you retain content as they're changed. When users see things they like but don't like, they want to use those pages as a visual aid (and they have the time to do so).

A PDF cannot be shared between different websites.

4. PDFs are easy to "hack" or "crack" into.

Let's just get this out of the way right now – if you're downloading a PDF file from a company or organization, especially if that one company or organization happens to be a large enterprise or ISP, then you are doing it wrong.

There are numerous tools available today that people use to take advantage of PDFs, including:

Microsoft Office and PDFs

Adobe Acrobat and PDF files

Google Drive and PDF files

Google Docs and PDF files

You name it, they've got it.

Unfortunately, it feels like the PDF community is still stuck in the past, and as a result most marketers still opt for PDF over HTML.

What are some reasons to use HTML? If there's no use for it (which is a good reason), go ahead and throw it away.

Why can't we use PDFs to sell e-books?

Now that we've talked about reasons to avoid HTML and PDFs, let's talk about why we should use PDFs to publish e-books. You might be surprised at what I've come up with!

1. PDFs are for people.

We are the largest user group out there who needs PDFs to have useful information about a product.

If your audience uses PDFs to look up information when they're in another country, or they use PDFs to share content on social media, they'll do it just because.

Not only that, people are already comfortable converting a PDF into a graphic file that can be printed, so we don't need to create separate files.

2. PDFs are great for business cards.

Not only do you have a business card that makes great-looking business cards and brochures, but a PDF is also a great format for business cards, for example:

Exploring the PDF universe

My first career was in publishing. Science textbook publishing, to be precise. In my six years as an editor, I spent thousands of hours meticulously reviewing PDF book manuscripts and printer proofs.

I learned that PDFs work well for certain applications, like preparing press-ready files that a printer can use to run off 50,000 copies without having them look like cheap Xeroxes. PDFs are also good for showing you exactly how a print piece is going to look in its final format with nifty things like crop marks, spread layouts, and gutters.

As a marketer, I've seen how PDFs also work well for content such as:

Printed brochures and other leave-behind materials

Direct mailers like postcards and one-sheets

Detailed research reports, buyer's guides, and reference materials

Long-form content for audiences with restricted Internet access

Unfortunately, it seems that many marketers, regardless of use case or audience, rely on PDFs as their default format for all their content, including e-books, white papers, case studies, and infographics. While

To put it simply, PDF files make PDFs. And PDF files are terrible for authors to use, especially when it comes to e-books.

Let's take some examples. Let's look at a typical PDF that a business sells to prospective customers that may be used to sell different types of products.

Let's say an individual or a startup wishes to sell a white paper with the following claim:

You need a PDF! (I know, you don't get a lot of free PDFs, but it's the industry standard so you have to deal with it.) You need a PDF that has all of the important information, including the logo, the author profile, and the cover art. You need this paper in a format that it can be converted to, which can be done in whatever software you want. That is, unless you need a PDF with an author profile and cover art at the same time. This is an odd choice, but it's probably fine.

But let's say you want an ebook. You could convert an ebook page to PDF, but the end result is often the same, at best. The image may have been moved but the text may be the same as it is on the printed page.

Let's give someone an e-book with an author profile and cover art for sale, but then also give them cover art for all of the other PDFs for an app. It's not the best option, but you need it, so you make the request to Google Docs' team.

 they may sound like good ideas, I've seen many disastrous missteps in converting PDF to e-book, and I think the following mistakes should never be repeated:

Avoid downloading a PDF into a reader without using e-book reader software, such as Adobe Digital Editions or Kobo's CreateSpace.

Printing a PDF without e-book reader software. You can use Kobo's createSpace service, but its print-on-demand pricing puts it beyond my reach and beyond the budget of most small businesses.

Downloading into the wrong e-reader. If you have an iPad or iPad mini, e-Reader apps like Pocket Book View and EPUB Reader are the easiest and fastest methods for reading to your device.

Not having any e-reader software, especially one that has a print-on-demand option. If you have a Kindle for iOS, for example, Kindle Paperwhite or Kobo Aura H2O are simple and easy options for reading to your iOS device at the tap of a button.

A pdf in print. Many eBook retailers, especially Smashwords and Amazon, ship book e-books as well as print books, which includes things like flyers, brochures, promotional items, and more. Some print options are free. If you're going to be distributing a bunch of PDFs, the best option to go with is something like Print-on-Demand. For a free subscription, sign up at iBookstore.com, Google Books, or Amazon for Kindle ebooks or Kindle Paperwhite ebooks. And when you sign-up at Smashwords, you'll get free access to Print-on-Demand too if you sign-up for Kindle Premium for $14.95 per month. You can even get print-on-demand print and Kindle books at Barnes & Noble, Borders and Simon & Schuster for a combined 12% off their prices.

As you can see, it makes a lot of sense to use print and eBook versions of your content equally. And if you're using Print-on-Demand for print or KDP for Kindle, you should make sure your PDF file is set up for all types of file types such as DOC, .DOCX, .DOC, .XLS, .XLSX, .PPT, etc.

If you do not have access to e-book software, you can always convert the PDF to an e-book on your desktop or any device with a PDF viewer with PDF conversion software like Preview++, Calibre, or iBooks Author for free. And if you're using the Print-on-Demand program, there is nothing better than free. I use Print-on-Demand to print e-books for free for my clients and to give free print-on-demand e-books to my readers. The next time that you're working on a PDF page with your designer or content editor, make sure that you have the right version of the PDF with the right typesetting on the page in front of you before you move on.<|endoftext|>Ric Flair is retiring from professional wrestling, and his announcement came shortly after WWE's first WWE Network subscription passed the 1 million subscriber mark.

Long-form content for audiences with restricted Internet access

Unfortunately, it seems that many marketers, regardless of use case or audience, rely on PDFs as their default format for all their content, including e-books, white papers, case studies, and infographics. While
==================== COMPLETION 188 ====================
 there are good reasons to do so, there are several things PDFs have that e-books don't.

PDFs are easier to read

First, most PDFs support a wide variety of different reading modes. Text can be displayed in standard-definition (SD), widescreen, and landscape aspect ratios.

In a typical ebook, you might display your content within a text-only mode, with text in a "window", a "frame", or a "row". For most e-books, text and graphics are displayed in the same document window, or as an embedded document within a window.

As you can probably guess, that can make the content difficult to comprehend. Many e-books with a single page of content (e.g., 1 article, 2 paragraphs, 3 table of contents) have text and graphics arranged in a single document window.

A popular tool that helps display content in a more usable manner is the PDF-reader "viewer". This tool can display your content in standard-definition (SD), widescreen, and other alternate-frame options, and can be used in conjunction with a text-reading helper like PDF Viewer.

A PDF can include multiple chapters/sections

Another important consideration for most marketing materials is that they are often divided into multiple sections as part of a larger document. For example, a sales page might have a series of subheadings within a single body paragraph.

For your research, reports, and other long-form materials, you can split up your content into multiple sections that will be presented in a single document window. There's two major ways to present these sections:

By default, each section looks like a separate document window. When you highlight a section and drag the mouse around, you can expand or collapse the content inside that section. This works for standard and larger PDFs. There's a second method, however, which can be more effective for content that is displayed in a document window. This method allows you to collapse or expand the sections of the document window as you drag them. For example, if you want to collapse a section, you can right-click in the document window and select "Show sections menu options" from the context menu. Here's an example: Open your e-book. Right-click on the Chapter 1 title block and select "Show sections menu options" from the context menu. A new "Section" window will appear with two tabs. Click on the left tab, "Chapter Content" and then "Divide sections". Click on the right tab, "PDF Options" and then slide right a tab to "Exclude Sections". This shows the entire document window as a single PDF document.

PDFs can be easily exported or uploaded to other services

In most instances, you'll only need to upload your e-book to a service like Amazon or Smashwords to market it. In many situations, this isn't necessary. However, some companies need to export their e-book onto a device such as a mobile or e-reader, for the purposes of e-book promotion.

You can easily export a PDF into an e-book document format (ePub) or a MOBI. Once you export a MOBI, all your marketing materials will be saved in your marketing file folder.

What about PDFs that are too big to fit on my device, such as books that are longer than 60,000 words?

If you're dealing with a PDF that is longer than 60,000 words, like an entire book, you probably have several options.

Using a PDF viewer

The simplest way to view the page for a particular document is to use a PDF viewer,

 Physcon was marching against her and sent her ambassadors to ask for help from Demetrius Nicator, the king of Syria. He was her son-in-law, for Cleopatra the wife to Demetrius was the daughter of this Cleopatra and Philometor. She promised him that he should have the kingdom of Egypt for his trouble. In hopes of that prize, he marched into Egypt, and made his first attack on Peleusium. (Justin. 1. 38. c. 9. & 1. 39. c. 1. Porphyrius, in Gracis, Eusebianus Scaligers, p. 227.) 3877a AM, 4586 JP, 128 BC 3796. In this year, Alexander Jannaeus, son to John Hyrcanus was born, who was later the king of the Jews. He lived for 49 years (Joseph. 1. 13. c. 23. fin.) As soon as he was born, he fell out of favour with his father. For it is said that Hyrcanus enquired of God who appeared to him in his sleep about his successor. He was very solicitous on the behalf of Aristobulus and Antigonus whom he loved far more than
==================== COMPLETION 189 ====================
 his sons. At once the prophecy of Daniel appeared to Hyrcanus when he was asleep, and he sent Alexander away to the army, but he himself set off in triumph from Jerusalem, followed by Aristobulus, Antigonus, Philip and his wife Eurydice, and all the people of Jerusalem. Alexander was then a youth of five and a half years, he was like a boy and his voice and appearance were as light, or as little as possible. For he was so ill from the disease of the belly and the pains and griefs he experienced. When he had entered on the reign of a monarch at Athens, he was called away by his mother. He then was sent to Egypt by the king of Persia who wanted to learn in what manner Alexander should rule in the kingdom. When Hyrcanus heard of this he was displeased, not knowing that Alexander was destined for his destruction. For the prophet had foretold that he himself would betray them for a certain price, a price which Alexander demanded as being very dear. The king of Persia demanded one-third of the kingdom of Persia before the death of Alexander (Joseph. 1. 27. c. 30. fin.) And that year also the prophet Amos the prophet brought tidings to Darius and the king of Syria. For an angel sent Amos in charge of all the people of the city of Syria, to say that the people of Israel, for this purpose, should be sent into captivity to Babylon; but that Darius, because he loved this people and wished to retain them among his own, would not allow them to return from captivity. This had been predicted in the prophet Amos by the word of the Lord, saying, Amos and my spirit to Darius, and my spirit to Darius and to all Israel, that he should be very much ashamed that he had removed this people, and would remember their affliction. And the prophet Amos was also charged to bring this prophecy to Darius the king, and to instruct him how he should preserve the Israelites. However he did not succeed in this; for Darius was not satisfied with the price demanded by the prophet Amos, but preferred the crowns which his mother (Eurydice) was giving him in her own name. So when Alexander came back from Persia, Hyrcanus and Alexander's mother Eurydice had a disagreement. For it is said that he went to his mother (Eurydice), and said that she had spoken falsely and was unruly about his affairs. And she said that he did not know that he was to be king of Persia. Thus there arose the quarrel between them and after much dispute, in which Hyrcanus killed her. And all Egypt was in great perplexity because of this woman's death, for they feared that he would kill himself or his mother. The first person who saw Alexander Jannaeus then was his mother, who said to him that no one else would be able to look after him if the royal power of his mother failed him. And as he was looking after himself, this man from the country of the Philistines (as his mother was called), called to himself Alexander and said to him: "My son, my son!" And Alexander said: "I am a child who looks just like a boy and speaks just like a child." And the man took leave of him, and he was with difficulty delivered of the child. When Darius arrived at Pherae, Alexander sent his mother Ptolemy and some other friends along with him, to ask the king if he would be willing to take Alexander and his mother as hostages. Darius replied by telling them to go to Rome. And as soon as they were there it was the turn of Alexander's mother to beg for security for Alexander from

 him. And he had to give them what they asked. Antigonus he made the king of Babylon, and he gave Atole the Persian, after Alexander Jannis. At this time Herod the Great died, and then Hyrcanus made a revolt against his father. He then marched across the lake into Asia, and made attacks upon Antiochus. He then invaded into Gaul and drove back to Syria Archelaus the tyrant. (Josephus. Antiquities, 7. 22. fin.) 3877b BC 3796. 2. On this occasion, Cleopatra gave instructions to Ptolemy Euergetes to go with 2.00 and 3.000 Macedonians against Antiochus, and to bring him to Egypt. When he had arrived at the sea he took ship, and sailed to Egypt, and arrived in the city of Egypt, where he was welcomed by Cleopatra. Cleopatra then sent for him. Antigonus made him prisoner in his fortress, and sent with him a herald of hers. For his name was Apollonius. And he, being put to death by the order of Cleopatra's ambassadors, was thrown into a well, and the man died. Now Cleopatra brought with her a number of Egyptian soldiers, and sent them to Antiochus. They were to bring him to Egypt, and to put him to death there. He was therefore put to death, in their sight, after a very long stay, and after many tortures. (Josephus, Antiquities 1. 1. fin. 1. Porphyrii, Scoli. Eusebianus Scaligers, p. 227.) 3904 BC 3796. 1. After the overthrow of the tyranny of Antigonus and Demetrius, Cleopatra went to Alexandria and began to build a new city there. For this reason, it was called Aelia Capitolina. In it also she put the children of Pompey to death who had been raised up under his government. As yet she was not content with this, but began to make many other disturbances among the Egyptians and other people. And a quarrel began between her and Ptolemy Euergetes, who was by then general in the war against the Persians. Cleopatra used much ill language, and called him, not one, but many, nymphs, for she was very fond of her own children. 2. But this Ptolemy Euergetes being the son of Ptolemy Vindex [Zeus Vindex], king of Egypt, was a friend of Cleopatra. This Ptolemy, then, after finding out that there was a great danger of his own, he determined to make his escape with his army. And this he did, and went away from Alexandria and made his way to the sea, and sailed out into the ocean, and was lost. He was the only person who lost his life in the war which she started against her father. She then went on with her conquests, and she had conquered not only Egypt but the whole of Africa besides. (Josephus. Antiquities, 7. 1. fin. 1. Porphyrii, Scoli. Eusebianus Scaligers, p. 227.) 3879 BC 3796. 2. For about the same time [Coeninus became king] of the Greeks, and Cleopatra having made great inroads upon Greece, went down there to her own kingdom. And her friends persuaded her to be reconciled to her brother, as he was still living. On this he was made head of the state. 3. After the death of Cleopatra, the Athenians were in great danger from their enemies being in alliance with

 himself. Hyrcanus sent messengers to Alexander Jannaeus at the instigation of Aristobulus at first, but afterwards with the same object with Antigonus. The Jews sent one of their elders to entreat him to take the crown off of Antigonus and make his brother Aristobulus king. But Alexander Jannaeus refused. It was reported that his father wanted he should take the throne, but his mother said that if he would not do that now, after he had lived a long time he would have to wait for him. He had great influence with his father, and his mother was said to be very beautiful to look at. But they were not allowed by the people to see her. But when Alexander Jannaeus's father sent her a great bribe, he said he would give her three hundred talents, but if that did not please her as well, he must make her king. At this, his mother got angry, for she had not got any money but for herself. Therefore, Alexander Jannaeus made a great feast on her, for she was very important, and made him give her the kingdom. She offered to give him all her possessions of land and of wealth but not her own children. (Josephus, Antiquities 13.5. 4; 16. 7. 6. 6. 4.) But Alexander Jannaeus made his peace with his father, and took up his abode in Cyprus. He was the only prince who had ever lived when he died. (Porphyrius. Eusebianus, Scalienses). 3877b AM, 4586 JP, 129 BC 3796, 1 BC 3793; 2 BC 394 . He was the only prince who had ever lived when he died. 3878f AM, 4586 JP, 132 BC 3520. Aeschines the Great, brother of Heracles the Great was born, who was later the king of Athens. He lived for 54 years (Josephus, War 5.13. 2, 14. c. 3. ed. H. E. Meyer, pp. 565 and 567.) 3879 JP, 131 BC 3700. Alexander of Macedon was born, who was later king of the Macedonians. He died in 27 BC and was buried in Aegina, in Italy. (Josephus, War 3.2. 4, 4.1. ed. H. E. Meyer, p. 529.) 3879a. AM, 4586 JP, 130 BC 3797, 1 BC 394. He was the second and successor of Alexander the great. For he too had been born in the time between the two world wars (Schürer & Hühnel, p. 10). He was named Agis. And he was called Alexander, the Great after his father (Agis 2.10-13), in honour of his mother (Agis 9.5). He governed Greece for 10 years. He also founded Macedonia. And he was the father of the Macedonian kings (Hühnel, p. 10).

 his own son, and asked that they should be entrusted with the government of the country (Joseph. 1. 14. c. 1. fin.). Thus the first to receive a title was Aristobulus (Joseph. 1. 17. c. 2. fin.). As regards the kings of the Assyrians, the last was Sennacherib. After him Nebuchadnezzar, son of Abiram and Arshibna, son of Abiram, son of Arshibna, the son of the king of Israel, who had reigned in Babylonia in his own name and ruled seven years, and also his younger half-brother, Hush-mezars, son of the king of Egypt, ruled, and were called the second, after the death of Nebuchadnezzar, who had reigned as king twenty-four years. (Joseph. 1. 18. fin.). About him are written the following in the book of the Chronicles: "He [Nebuchadnezzar] was the chief of Babylon, and the greatest of kings. He was the builder of his temple, and of its buildings" (Hab. 3. 14. c. 16.) It is probable from what has been mentioned that his wife, Babylona, was a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar. (Joseph. 1. 19. fin.). When Sennacherib came into Babylonia, he made himself king, and made war on the Jews. The Jews, for their part, made war on him. "Sennacherib the king of the Medes, he [Josephus] says, was taken in one night at Jerusalem, and many of his forces were scattered to their death, and many of his treasures were taken from him" (Josephus. Antiquities 7. 47. c. 3.). But the Jews, by their wise policy, were able to bring in the time of David into the country, and so they drove out Nebuchadnezzar and his chief companions. From thence they ruled over the Jews until the death of Alexander II, king of Macedonia (Joseph. 2. 2. fin., 3. 4. fin.), who died in the twenty-fourth year of his age. For, as the Greeks relate, when Alexander was about to die, he said to himself: "Oh that we were at once alive again in our own land! For in that land we would find our friends, who would gladly defend us in the fight against the king of the Medes." (Apollodorus, Hist. Ch. 6. 5. c. 3.) At the time when David returned to Jerusalem, after the overthrow of the kingdom of the Medes, he died of wounds given him by Nebuchadnezzar. (2 Sam. 24. 3. 1. & 2 Chron. 2. 16. fin.) When he was lying slain, his younger brother, Hush-machars, said to him: "My father, the king is risen from the dead, you will see him, I trust."

By participating and buying a variety of virtual items, gamers receive rewards such as extra character slots, a free copy for their friends, or even free credits.

Tencent also provides some additional incentives and bonuses. Tencent's official campaign webpage asks gamers to register their "personal accounts and play [their] real life time" to be eligible for special bonuses; for example, the player could collect 10 million points or collect 10 billion points without having to do any work to get them. Furthermore, gamers who collect enough points are granted one of the three special mounts currently available through World of Warcraft's Black Market (more on this topic below), as well as the World Boss Mount.

On Thursday afternoon, during his first formal meeting as president, President Obama went to the White House Rose Garden to formally announce the start of US-Australia (and other Pacific-rim nations) trade negotiations. "We are in the beginning stages of a comprehensive agreement," Obama said.

"We are in the beginning stages of a comprehensive agreement" pic.twitter.com/HtJzQ3m7DU — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 3, 2014


As president, and his trade czar, Michael Froman, who is the former US ambassador to Singapore, have made no secret about their opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). But that hasn't stopped them from moving forward. Just last month, the Obama administration announced two major deals with Southeast Asian nations, with Vietnam and Malaysia agreeing trade deals with the US for $80 billion for a dairy trade deal and a pact that will see a Chinese state-owned company sell $3 billion worth of auto parts to the US.

Now, TPP has been replaced by a new trade package called the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP) and the White House is going back to work on TPP. In this context, the administration has announced that it wants to use the TPP to get other Pacific Rim countries to take their trade deals in partnership with the United States.

"We're looking for new partners to move forward in Asia-Pacific, which represents about 10pc of global trade," Obama said in the Rose Garden. "We have no choice in the trade equation. We can't just negotiate them on our own. Now, we're going to be working very hard with partner nations – some of whom we've already been negotiating with for some time – who are moving ahead."

Here's a map of the new region we'll be working with:

From the US perspective, Australia is the centerpiece of this initiative. The United States has been working with Australia on TPP and on other regional deals, including the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Last month, The Washington Post reported that the Obama administration has been working with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott for months on how to negotiate trade deals without upsetting their relationship with the US on immigration reform and the fate of asylum seekers.

The TPP has the most potential to advance the US-Australia relationship in the world, given Australia's status as a major US ally in the Asian Pacific region and its role as the

It said the state's chief minister should have approached the High Court for a bill in this regard."In a case of grave public order disturbance, the government may ask the High Court to take cognisance of a situation in public areas, and not interfere in such matters," Justice KK Venugopal observed.

The HC also said the state should not interfere in the decisions taken by the legislative assembly or state cabinet on a law's proposed amendments, or on the interpretation and implementation of a law.

Photo: 123rf

The case involves the right of Asian-origin people in New Zealand to be accepted into top universities and to have their ethnic background considered.

Lawyers for the Association of Asian Lawyers have been granted full access to evidence about New Zealand's universities, which will include the results of the country's selection process for admissions for universities.

This was previously only released when lawyers for a particular race - for example, black or Asian - requested access through a freedom-of-information request.

The case comes amid heated political and media debate over discrimination and affirmative action after the University of Auckland admitted that its selection procedures discriminated against Asian applicants.

Mr Justice Bruce Higginson, writing in his judgment on Wednesday morning, said the case was a "stunning illustration of the flaws of the race-based admissions system", and of the importance of examining the "real-world" impact affirmative action had had on individuals.

He said the University of Auckland had been an organisation "without clear racial objectives".

Race was "an element" of both the admission process and the selection process, which had a "distorted effect... on the racial composition of the University".

In the case before the court, Anh Ngo, a Chinese applicant to the University of Auckland, argued that while he was eligible for entrance because of his ethnicity, he was unable to compete because he had not been accepted to the University of Auckland's law school or to a different Auckland University School of Law (UONSL) school.

Mr Ngo had lived in New Zealand for 25 years but he did not have citizenship, having left New Zealand shortly after the 1965 anti-colonial riots to live and work in Hong Kong.

In addition, the judge noted that the university had "frequently" asked whether applicants had family links to overseas countries in order to confirm whether applicants were "white New Zealand residents".<|endoftext|>The UESPWiki – Your source for The Elder Scrolls since 1995

 in the future."

In his words, bitcoin should always strive to be the easiest and most accessible type of crypto, and a good place for everyone.

However, other altcoins can learn from dogecoin's example (and that of Bitcoin itself): "The altcoin must aim for a wide base on a more important level and use their platform to better the people who use it and to further promote the wider internet," says Palmer, who also argues that it would be possible for a project to become more than one coin.

He does not think that such projects should be limited to the digital market; rather, the communities should be involved in this. "The reason the altcoin community should be involved with the general community is because the community benefits from both being open and accessible," Palmer asserts. He believes it is the responsibility of the community to spread news and educate its community.

And for that, he believes, the dogecoin community is in a better position than many other altcoins due to its greater focus in the past on charitable works (as well as its greater accessibility).

"It is the best way to build a community around charity or help, because it has a wider reach than traditional ways," Palmer reasons. "That way, the community gets to decide where their donations go."

Palmer doesn't think there is necessarily anything sinister about dogecoin. In fact, he believes that it is "a cool coin and a good example of how [cryptocurrencies] can benefit others."

However, he admits that it has its flaws. For one thing, it could also do better with its community. However, Palmer believes he can be the one to solve such problems, in part by working on more dogecoin-related projects.

"All altcoins and the greater internet can benefit from more active community and more active communities," he argues. "The reason I am involved in the dogecoin community is that that we are more open – to anyone, and not just the internet. So in the long run, I hope the dogecoin community becomes more open to other people who want to take part. A lot of people who are part of other communities will be happy to be involved in a more open community – and I think that does help other, smaller communities and wider internet."<|endoftext|>Somewhere, a young man is watching ESPN3 and it's the highlight of his week.

After a brief internal investigation , a federal court ruled that it had violated a judge's order to stop tracking people. While that particular case may be the end of a chapter in this government surveillance, it's a good sign for a better future for privacy and liberty everywhere.

As reported by The Washington Post, the government admitted that it tracked people by examining data from AT&T's business records database since May, even though the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) had previously asked the FBI for permission not to do so. The U.S. government argues that the information was not "relevant and material" enough.

In fact, as Bloomberg explains, the FBI has done a lot of things like this recently. When the government was caught spying on two foreign leaders by hacking their phones, even though it seemed highly questionable:

A week, two weeks ago, a team of FBI agents who were conducting what it described as a "routine counterterrorism investigation" in Yemen tracked two men in contact with Yemen-based al Qaeda militants. One of the men, Anwar al-Awlaki, was "an American citizen and cleric" who had provided material support to terrorists. Investigators determined that the men were among those intercepted over "numerous calls to [a local phone] company in Yemen, many of which were placed between the U.S. and Yemen" and also involved calls to the Yemeni Embassy in Washington.

Not only was this case not about terrorism, but it also took place in a country that does have a pretty good track record in defending people against government attempts to spy on them. The NSA is still quite likely surveying people's phone records in this country even though, as the FBI conceded in its brief to the Court in the case, it hadn't done so for years.

While this case will likely be the end of a chapter on government surveillance in the United States, a more interesting change has occurred recently as well. As Bloomberg reports, when the FISC first tried to impose some limits on NSA surveillance, the government said it didn't need warrants to surveil foreign leaders' phones since it had that information from other intelligence sources. Once those limitations were imposed, the government became even more insistent that it could spy on the communications and associations of American foreign leaders, even if those U.S. leaders don't have any communication or association with a foreign terrorist group like al-Qaeda.

Although these kinds of cases are still more rare than you may think, if anything they are growing more common. The NSA has been secretly doing this for years. That isn't enough, however, for the government. In fact, as more and more countries start banning companies like Facebook and Twitter from being used as tools of propaganda by their governments, it's becoming more important than ever that we keep protecting ourselves from people like the NSA.<|endoftext|>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is looking to change its approach to funding biomedical research programs.

He had to learn a new scheme, new schemes, new schemes, and when he did all those things well he was given a new quarterback with a new system. That's how you win the national championship. Winston just didn't know how to adapt to a new system to run an offense that was far too complicated. He'd be good enough with the run and pass if he had a quarterback who could get the ball out more quickly.

No one saw it, no one knew it because they never saw the Seminoles as a football team. They were just another defense. They were a defense that had a scheme that worked, a team that would win if those same defenses were used. This is what Florida State did, and they are great because they were an offense that didn't know it was an offense and didn't know it was a defense, but they were an offense because it didn't matter in the end and they won. What makes it so amazing? They knew it. That's it.

A lot of this list is comprised of coaches, but there's one coach who doesn't deserve any special consideration. That would be Nick Saban and his staff of Crimson Tide coaches, but it's not just Nick. It's not just Alabamese football or Alabama football. There really shouldn't be a player to be put ahead of it.

They are all exceptional football coaches. They are all good at their jobs. They all know their stuff.

They know what it takes to win championships. But how did these coaches do it, to be so great at what they do so many times? The answer is because they knew their stuff. They weren't trying to get a quarterback in the draft. They weren't going to waste a first round pick on a QB that just doesn't play. They weren't looking to find a free agent that would put up great numbers. It wasn't a "don't draft a QB if he's available" philosophy. This was "don't waste a first round pick on a player that has no chance to play". What separates the Crimson Tide is that they knew enough about football not just to win but to win as good as they do. They know how to play and who they are. They know how to get it done in the SEC. That makes them extraordinary, and it speaks volumes about the program that they continue to do so well after 50 years of college football.<|endoftext|>1 Timestamp What game(s) did you play the most that was not a video game?

4. Clemson

Clemson's schedule was a do or die for a National Title. In order to be the most consistent, consistent player in football we know and love, Clemson needed to beat a Power 5 opponent every single week, and play each game at its absolute best.

While we were able to make it to the championship game, we had to be perfect. This was a tough task, but it is a task that we have never relished taking on, and we've never even come close.

The Clemson defense is one of the hardest in the country, and that is before getting to the talent front seven on offense. Offensive player of the year Deshaun Watson is arguably the best player in the country, and Clemson had to play in his Heisman race against a defense that had gotten better and better in year after year after year.

We will always be the team that let the Heisman Trophy slip through our fingers in the last game, but we must carry that burden with us to the national championship game.

5. Northwestern

We may be one of just two teams (The University of Texas of course) that played in three bowl games in the past seven years, and even when we did, it wasn't enough to make a deep run under Bob Stoops.

If you haven't been watching football, you have probably forgotten the Northwestern football team had an ungodly amount of success on the road.

If you are a Wildcats fan, you are probably wondering what all the fuss is about.

Well, we all know now.

On paper this looks like a great situation for us. The road has been brutal for Northwestern football in recent years. And it's time to get it started on the right foot.

The Wildcats have an all-time great defensive coordinator in Pat Fitzgerald, and have recruited well across the board. I'm not being facetious when I say we have the best defense in the country.

In fact, Northwestern has a top five defense. It has one of the best front sevens in all of college football today, and some of the best talent in the country.

This will be a team that will be playing for championships every season.

6. Notre Dame

In 2013, not a whole lot changed. The Fighting Irish had a couple good years, lost a few games, and got through another bowl game. Then they had nothing but success in 2014, and had to play an SEC team with the best quarterback in the country come off of a bye week. And in 2015 they played a team with two All World quarterbacks.

Since that last time, however, Notre Dame has been an incredibly dominant football team, as we have never been to any kind of a bowl game. It may seem like a harsh thing to say, but let me explain.

Ninth in the country, playing a conference rival against a bye week. That's right in the middle of the schedule. This is something we could not deal with in years past.

This is Notre Dame football. This is how we roll.

We could still find a way to go 7-6 and make one more bowl game. I think a 7-6 record will likely occur, and a 6-6 or 7-5 would be more likely. Either way, the path is there for us. The Notre Dame team that looks like this on paper will be one that is fun to watch, and will bring a lot of excitement to the Big Ten and football across the nation.

1. Ohio State

For all the questions that are being asked about Urban Meyer, he has had one of the finest opening days of any coach in recent history. But the man who brought the Buckeyes into the national consciousness on the field, Tim Beckman, doesn't want us to forget that.

On Monday he showed us the greatness of the state of Wisconsin. It starts with his wife Beth, and runs through their son Chris and daughter Laura. Beckman is an even better husband and father than he is a coach, and he treated his kids to the most beautiful wedding the state has to offer at this year's event.

Beckman was fired by Ohio State after the 2011 season. He had a tremendous year back in 2009, but never really developed the foundation for the program he was trying to build. This year, when the season began, the Buckeyes were 1-8 on the road. Now they have won three straight road games to start the season. That's a start. And he is proving that he is capable of developing young players.

He's getting the players to come and work out with him, which makes for some real bonding moments on those days on the practice field. When he is coaching, he gets to know his players, and he's really developing a unique relationship with them. Some of his favorite things to do as a coach involve football. His children, however, seem to be as excited about playing, playing, playing as he is about coaching football.


If there was a national title at stake this fall, no one has more to lose than Beckman. He has one shot at a program that is now back in contention in the Big Ten. For as much as he is being blamed by some for not winning, he's been criticized on so many fronts. But he won. He should now be celebrated for that.<|endoftext|>A video that purports to show a young Palestinian boy lying on the floor after being shot by Israel appears to have been staged.

The video, which was posted Sunday by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, shows a young boy, his face covered with a blood-spattered sheet, being carried away by Israeli border police. The boy is bleeding from the neck and chest and appears to have been shot multiple times.

The boy's left eye, which had been pulled out, is clearly seen in a close-up. The Israeli soldiers can be seen around him. "The boy did not have an eye. It was a fake injury. They shot him in the head," said the boy's uncle, Asad Abdullah Saleem, in an interview with the Associated Press.

According to the AP report, Saleem claimed the boy was only "lightly wounded by the bullets." The boy was injured, Saleem alleged, "for the money they stole [from him]."

The incident took place in Israel's Ashdod district on Sunday. After the boy collapsed, three soldiers took him to hospital. The boy was treated for shrapnel wounds and bruises. He was released from the hospital on Monday.

You know you're a champion when the biggest headline is your coach is accused of rape.

Losing four starters up front to graduation, you take your best shot at recruiting, bringing in top running back Dede Westbrook and safety Reggie Ragland to replace Reggie Ragland and Landon Collins. Despite your best efforts to improve your defensive line, all that really matters in Tuscaloosa is the defense.

So, we're faced with a choice that only you could actually make. We have the best football team in the country and the most exciting offense in the country. Can you really imagine another program with that much potential and opportunity?

Well, it was an open question until, well, it was an open question.

Now the Crimson Tide must defend Alabama football.

With the return of five starters, it's time for Nick Saban to start focusing on finding talent to make sure this offense stays humming. With the emergence of freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts and the fact the offense has averaged 39 points per game, this won't be the final year that Alabama football makes the College Football Playoff. This might be the only year.

The 2017 season also means more playing time for the Tide quarterbacks.<|endoftext|>This is a question that I've been asked for over a year now. I've been too busy trying to get as much done at the moment (and you can't have time to read through this text for every one of my articles!) so I decided it would be best to share this with my readership.

So, after all of my research and experience of the recent past, I feel that this will be the most definitive answer on the subject of what is the best way to achieve a deep sleep. To be frank, there is only one way, and that is going to sleep deep, then wake up deeply. Nothing has been proven any different than this. There is no way that I know of that can achieve a deeper sleep. This doesn't mean that I don't want you to get that deep sleep, it just means that is the only way. I don't advocate anything different.

A deep sleep is defined by scientists as lasting 3-6 hours (usually longer though). What does this mean exactly?

The body needs roughly 3-6 hours of sleep before reaching a fully awoken state. We have a tendency to skip a few hours every day!

You are more likely to skip your bed at various times throughout the day. For example, if you have a long day ahead of you, you may feel like you can't rest as deeply as normal and skip in the middle. Or, you may find yourself tossing and turning at night due to jet lag, fatigue and even stress…

Deep sleep does not always take place at a certain time. Our bodies adjust our sleep pattern according to the time of day.

While being in the depths of a deep sleep, some people say they hear a little bump on their forehead with pressure. This is what we call an electroencephalogram, or EEG pattern. This is what we typically refer to as your "sleep dream". In actuality, you are in a dream world, but the dream world is different, and can be very vivid. If you're able to wake up deeply without falling asleep again, you may experience

. But officials of a mayoral group that the former NBA star and controversy magnet claims to be representing in his lawsuit say they're not on his side.

"We want nothing to do with Kevin Johnson," says Vanessa Williams, executive director of the National Conference of Black Mayors, an Atlanta-based organization that Johnson listed as a co-plaintiff in his suit. "He's not even a member. He tried to ruin this organization. I dare Kevin Johnson to find one person with this organization who supports him. Just one! Everybody with this organization hates Kevin Johnson. Nobody gave him permission to sue for us."

Johnson filed his odd suit after Cosmo Garvin, a reporter with the weekly Sacramento News & Review, filed a request for emails the mayor and his staff sent using private Gmail accounts while doing city business. The Sacramento Bee had made a similar records request earlier this year. Johnson has long faced accusations that he forces staffers on the public payroll to do work not related to their employment, and has them use private accounts while doing his personal bidding.

Among the communications the city attorney was prepared to release were emails between Johnson and lawyers from Ballard Spahr, a firm Johnson used during his brief and debacle-filled reign as NCBM president
==================== COMPLETION 201 ====================
 between 2007 and 2012. The emails show Johnson's staff talking about the state of the city's finances during the period he was president, a time when Johnson paid himself $1,000 a month.

Johnson claims that a group called the Citizens Electoral Reform Committee used his emails to harass him. The group's president is former NCBM Executive Director and Sacramento State Senator Don Hahn, who recently was named by Gov. Jerry Brown in his state Senate race as a possible Democratic nominee. That campaign has since been called off. Johnson says Garvin had contacted him too.

"The correspondence shows that our group has received anonymous threats and emails from unknown emails," the complaint argues. "The emails appear to be from someone claiming to be a member of the 'Citizens Electoral Reform Committee' but which is, in fact, the same person who submitted these anonymous, harassing and false emails to Kevin Johnson earlier this spring."

In their reply to the court, the lawyers for the state Democratic Party and Johnson say the emails are legitimate public disclosures and Johnson and his team were entitled to request the emails under California's Sunshine Laws. In this case, the group was a 501(c)(4).

"These emails are public records," they say. "The plaintiffs have no standing to bring any lawsuit or seek any sanctions based on the plaintiffs' public interest claims. The emails contain public statements of fact about the city. Therefore, the plaintiffs are entitled to receive them."

The lawyers also argue that Johnson has shown that the plaintiffs have standing to bring the suit because of the city attorney's office's refusal to release all of the emails under the law, but Garvin disagreed. Johnson, he says, is trying "to bring this suit himself."

Johnson disputes the argument, insisting he has no connection to the group and had nothing to do with the Citizens Electoral Reform Committee. "I've never used any group I was connected to," he says.

The former mayor says he's suing the city "to expose what's bad going on in Sacramento politics right now." In an interview at the Sacramento airport, he says that Garvin, a Sacramento-bred lawyer, is a well-known opponent of his candidacy.

"He has an anti-mayor agenda," he says. "He's been a good friend of the NCBM."

Still, Johnson concedes there is merit to the accusations he's making in the suit. "To some extent at least, I'm being investigated for having a vendetta, that's a common thing in Washington," he says. "I think I've been persecuted for trying to change the political and business climate in Sacramento. But it's not that."

Johnson says he's not worried about the outcome, adding that he'd stand by his lawsuit if he lost.

But it seems unlikely. His attorney, John Hodge, says he is confident the judge will make the emails public. He said the mayor's allegations against the NCBM "are not just patently false, they are completely outlandish and ludicrous."

Williams says the NCBM and Johnson are still looking for partners to join their lawsuit. "No one wants to be the next lawsuit," she says. "If we don't do it, who will?"

Correction: The original story misnamed the Sacramento-based firm Garvin's firm used, and said Johnson's lawsuit came as a result of Hahn calling him. The suit was filed by the state Democratic Party. Garvin, in fact, filed the suit with Johnson.<|endoftext|>The government has announced that it is to spend a million pounds providing every school in England with computers.

 in 2011, according to Garvin's subpoena. Those emails were released earlier this month, but not before the city attorney's office made the unusual move of going to the California Supreme Court to stop them from being released.

Johnson has taken the position that he doesn't work for the city of Fresno, which is controlled by NCBM member Jim Johnson, but he does report to the elected officials of the City Council. That means he's legally bound not to talk to council members regarding business unrelated to city business, and that his use of private accounts isn't a violation of city policy because it's perfectly legal for Johnson to do the same thing, Garvin wrote.

Johnson's legal team has also argued that he has every right to email under the public record laws because he's just a member of an association, not the elected Mayor, City Manager, and City Council members for the city of Fresno, as was originally reported. Garvin's filing for a court order to unseal their emails also doesn't make it clear that the city has any interest in finding out if that's true.

"We're all about transparency," NCBM Executive Director Williams tells the Guardian in a phone interview. "It would be easy to look at the public's interest in knowing what council members were doing on public business without seeing any proof of how that was being done or that they were being used by the mayor. What we can look at is the law. If you're a member of this organization as represented in the filing and you're acting in a non-managerial capacity and you're not conducting governmental business, that's a real problem."

Johnson wasn't happy with Garvin's decision to share what was in his subpoenaed emails with a reporter, though. "I'm really sorry NCBM members but you broke the law," the mayor tweeted in response, according to the Sacramento Bee. "In doing so this is the only information I have. In the future I will be more circumspect in such matters."

Williams says Johnson is being hypocritical about his use of private accounts. "He's being disingenuous [by] tweeting out about transparency when he's actually a hypocrite to what he's suggesting with his use of private email for city business," Williams says. "He did the same thing when the city was being sued for something he was going to do. There's nothing like a lawsuit to raise red flags. He's being disingenuous. He has nothing to hide. This is all about transparency."

Williams says NCBM members in Sacramento have already made it known to her that they don't want Johnson to be a part of the group. "It's not in their best interest to put him in," she says. "We've had several meetings with the NCBM members in Sacramento. We're all about non-judgmental, friendly relationships with our mayors. There may be members of NCBM who have had some issues with him, but so far he has a very good relationship with us."

. The emails were among the records Garvin had requested. Johnson's suit argued that Ballard Spahr was an unlawful use of public money and claimed his emails with his legal team were subject to the state's public records law.

The court agreed with Johnson. The case is set to go to trial Jan. 8 with Judge David Tatel presiding.

Johnson, 49, has claimed for some time that Sacramento has been working hand in hand with his mayoral opponents in trying to keep him out of office from 2006 through 2011. His mayoralty lasted just 10 days, and he was forced to step down after a scandal involving the sale of city property.

But for the NCBM, Johnson is a thorn in the side. He has been the subject of a long series of lawsuits filed by the organization itself and numerous other elected officials (most recently former Mayor Kevin Johnson and current NCBM President Mary Haynie), which also claims he forces local politicians to use private accounts to do his bidding. His lawsuits, too, are on hold while the case goes to trial.

The NCBM has a long history in Sacramento and has hosted fundraisers for the Sacramento mayor and other city lawmakers. Johnson's attorneys claim the organization violated the federal Constitution's First Amendment by using the private email accounts and failed to register as a PAC. Johnson has also accused Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson of being in cahoots with the Sacramento Bee, alleging the newspaper is trying to make him look bad.

While the NCBM has claimed ownership over Johnson's emails, its leadership has repeatedly said they are not Johnson's employees and that they do their own accounting and fundraising.

Williams, who did not make herself available for comment, said the NCBM does not share information with Johnson's lawsuits, adding that it's in the organization's own best interest to cooperate.

"We're not going to give a dime. We're going to fight for our principles and the people we represent," says Williams. "He was elected by the voters to fight for civil rights and the civil rights of other people, not us. We don't know anything about his emails, we're not taking money from him."

Williams also said Sacramento's mayor is free to work with NCBM on the issues he deems important.

"It has nothing to do with what the NCBM is up to," says Williams. "He may be one of its members, but our members don't work for him. They work on their issues because this city is underfunded more than it's ever been. They're not going to put that on the backs of us."

Davis says Johnson's lawsuit is an effort to make a name for himself at the expense of Sacramento's own residents.

"Kevin's trying to make a name for himself in Sacramento by suing the city for no reason," says Davis. "All we are trying to do is get him off the ballot in 2012 and have him serve out his term for four years. He should be focusing on real issues to serve the citizens of Sacramento."

Williams agrees.

"I'm not going to give this man his money back," she says.

Davis says that since the suit goes before a judge, his office will be ready to fight it if the city attorney decides to file an appeal at the federal level because Davis still has to prove all the allegations in Johnson's case.<|endoftext|>The New York Times

 and mayor of Sacramento in the 2011-12 fiscal year. He resigned from that post in June 2012, four months into a term that was marked by several scandals and allegations of ethical woes.

But this week, the state attorney general rejected an appeal by Johnson and Cosmo Garvin, demanding an independent investigation. A group of attorneys representing Ballard Spahr has argued those communications are exempt under California public records law.

The mayor and his team say they're being railroaded. "The only reason the case has been brought is the attorney general has not agreed to let us have a neutral third party to investigate how the emails were handled," says Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Carberry. "In contrast, Mayor Johnson is the one asking for a third party to look into his emails, not us."

According to the Sacramento Bee, the mayor also demanded this week that emails that allegedly belong to top NCBM officials — in particular, those belonging to NCBM President Michael Tubbs — be turned over to the Sacramento mayor's office. Johnson declined to comment beyond repeating the demand during a telephone interview Monday night.

Williams said Johnson is a "good friend," that she has known Johnson since before he became mayor. The attorney general's office says Johnson, who is scheduled to appear in Sacramento Superior Court on Wednesday for an extradition hearing, has never met Tubbs.

Calls to Tubbs' home in San Diego went unanswered Monday night and Tuesday.

But NCBM officials were clear about their disdain for Johnson, saying they don't think he's qualified to represent NCBM.

Said Williams, "It's like he's trying to make a run at NCBM. A couple of times I've even seen him say, 'Oh, how about you?'"

Johnson himself is not above the law. He has had two misdemeanor DUI convictions. But Johnson, a former professional athlete, has served in the military and has made millions of dollars in other lucrative professions.

The Sacramento mayor's lawsuit may have been inspired by an interview the former NBA player did with The Washington Post's Howard Fineman, in which he made a big show of saying what Johnson supposedly had said to his "good friend" Garvin. According to Fineman: "Kobe says, 'Just stop, you'll make a fool of yourselves, and you'll blow this whole thing up.' And I heard him say, 'Don't tell him, because he's a good friend.'"

Williams said Johnson does not work for NCBM and has no idea who is on Johnson's payroll, let alone who is speaking for him or NCBM. "I'm still baffled as to why the mayor would file this lawsuit," she says. "It's just crazy. This is a frivolous and malicious lawsuit, and we want nothing to do with it."

Johnson's campaign says that Cosmo Garvin is just an "excellent" lawyer and friend. "He did a great job on this," Johnson said after the news broke that Cosmo Garvin was behind the suit.

"I guess he got paid," Johnson said of the $100,000 paid to Garvin. "I'm not going to comment on that. He's doing his job."

Barry Westholm, former sergeant-major for the Joint Personnel Support Unit, said that one way to mitigate suicide is to educate recruits on what VAC provides when they enlist, as opposed to having them navigate that system with a debilitating injury.

Not all military suicides were the result of deployment—31 per cent of U.S. military suicides weren't deployed in a combat zone, and Canadian statistics show a similar pattern. But the numbers suggest a causal link between combat and suicide. In the U.S. there is fear that the alarming rise in suicide rates after Iraq and Afghanistan (more than doubling between 2001 and 2006) has become the new normal. It was hoped that this was simply a spike, but the rates haven't gone down in the decade since, and remain roughly twice the civilian rate. In the American Civil War (1861-65), one of the first to provide data on suicide, the suicide rate was highest in the year after the fighting ended. It can take a while to manifest itself.

 Barry Westholm during his visit. "It is still very much a problem in any combat area—and you have to be prepared." According to a 2013 Royal Canadian Navy report, up to 40 per cent of military deaths in Afghanistan are attributed to combat injuries, with the highest levels of injury suffered by sailors and pilots who often operate aircraft in remote settings where they don't have access to help. These rates of suicide among sailors and pilots have since dropped, but military suicide continues to go up across uniformed services, and the numbers bear this out.

Suicide rates among veterans is a complex matter. The rate for Canadian veterans with traumatic brain injuries is five times that of those who do not have TBIs. The reasons for this discrepancy are complex and there has been some confusion over the differences between exposure and incidence. But it stands to reason that the higher rate of suicide among veterans isn't entirely a result of the TBIs; this is a factor. It's not hard to identify the underlying issues that contribute to it.

"I'm still surprised that there is no recognition of this," said the veteran, who did not want to be identified.

It's a similar story with veterans over PTSD. Although a 2013 report conducted on the behalf of the Office of Veterans Affairs Canada suggested that almost half of veterans were not coping well with war, the latest CAF Statistics show that it is far from the case. Many say they feel invisible.

One day last fall, as I was walking past the veterans memorial outside of the Montreal city hall, a man wearing a tattered, mismatched winter jacket stopped me. We shook hands, I told him I was from the Toronto Star and he told me his name was Daniel, but he didn't identify himself as a veteran. Instead, he told me he had just come from a funeral, where he had found a family member killed in a bomb explosion in Afghanistan. Daniel told me his story of fighting that war and coming home to a country that didn't support him. "They never taught us how to handle PTSD," he said. The Toronto Star has previously published a story documenting Daniel's troubles with Canada's veteran support system for returning veterans.

Daniel told me the most common method of dealing with the physical and emotional effects of war was to lie about what he was really dealing with. It was often the best way to get help, and at first Daniel was a successful soldier, he said. He returned with medals and commendations. He got married and had two children. But after a decade of active duty, he found he couldn't continue. The physical effects of PTSD were too much, and he was forced to come home. It wasn't enough, and neither was it for me.

When, in 2002, I left for Afghanistan, I wasn't thinking about war. I was thinking about what I could possibly do in order to save my life. I spent some of my life preparing for the mission. Every day I tried to think: Should I be doing this? What would I do? Would I do this?

A lot happens on the front lines in Afghanistan from fighting, and for Daniel that included constant, intense mental anguish. He had gone into a frenzy several weeks before his suicide attempt, where he lashed out with his fists and screamed at his family. On August 22, 2002, his wife called 911 after he was screaming at her, "I want to die. I want to die." He was admitted to a psychiatric facility, but he was released a few months later, he told me. The hospitalization left him disoriented for months; the day before he took his life there were more than 30 officers in his unit playing cards.

The conversation turned to the topic of the Navajo people.

Suddenly one of our friends, a white man in his early 60s, turned toward us and whispered, "I'm not Navajo but I love it so much. I like that when the birds come back on the water when it's a storm — it sounds like a hundred million drums."

This was a little startling at first, but we were all kind of caught off guard as the conversation turned to this.

"Is this what you've always felt?" one of us whispered in amazement.

I wondered if he was referring to the stories we had heard on the radio about that same wind? The one that sounded like the sound of hundreds of drums beating?

But even though we could have laughed at his statement, we did not. We all understood that this "trumpeter" wasn't describing the sound of the winds in general. It was, literally, the sound of a thousand drums beating.

He actually was talking about the Navajo Nation Band of Luiseno Indians, which is located just southeast of Flagstaff, Arizona.

If you ever visit the Navajo Nation, it's impossible to miss the thousands of buffalo heads scattered across the landscape. Buffalo heads are sacred artifacts of this nation and are used to bless the water in which buffalo swim. Every single buffalo that comes through the community of Luiseno is blessed by the community.

Because buffalo are sacred, a good portion of the Navajo Nation's budget goes towards maintaining and protecting them. Buffalo are a very important part of Native culture and it should come as no surprise that a good portion of our budget is dedicated to preserving them.

The Navajo National Museum of the American Indian even has an annual Buffalo Buffalo Fair, where thousands of buffalo heads and tusks come through the gates to be blessed. If you can't make it to the event, it is broadcast 24/7 by the Navajo Nation.

However, the American Indian Religious Freedom Program – an organization that supports Native communities while protecting the rights of religious freedom – reports that Native Americans are denied the ability to access, possess, and use sacred items and that Native Americans frequently have their land taken from them while their sacred items are being protected.

"Our culture, our language, our traditions, our sacred ceremonies, and our holy places are under attack and we are losing our traditions," said Terese Kehara, Director of Religious Liberties Program for the American Indian Religious Freedom Program in a Washington, D.C. press release.

One of the primary reasons that buffalo heads are needed to sanctify the water in which bison swim is that the buffalo are actually sacred to the Navajo. When they first came to this country they did just

==================== COMPLETION 207 ====================
 Dr. Robert Langer, director of the VA's Veterans Health Administration and a co-chair of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention. "We're just beginning to scratch the surface." Langer's organization has been tracking suicide in veterans for years—one report estimated that 5,200 vets commit suicide every year—and he notes that suicide is often a symptom of PTSD, which he argues is a chronic condition more prevalent among veterans than the general population. "There are a lot of PTSD related issues in the military and a lack of connection to the care that there needs to be, which makes it difficult to get help when things are wrong," Langer says. The stigma surrounding mental health and PTSD has also played a part. With such an obvious link between war and suicide, it's understandable why a lot of soldiers and vets choose to attempt suicide, and there is a stigma around mental health that, Langer says, is not as prevalent in society at large.

As one example, in 2007, a study conducted by the VA estimated that one in 20 female soldiers who serve in Afghanistan take their own life, and one in three veteran suicides are male. When Langer came home and spoke with his colleagues about his findings, not a single one believed he was serious. He is frustrated that so few people believe PTSD can cause suicide, despite the fact that that link is clearly established and often expressed.

This lack of understanding, he said, is an epidemic. Dr. William Schaffner, an addiction psychiatrist and director of the Division of Mental Health at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tenn., told reporters in a 2013 conference call that it is a national crisis. He sees this as an opportunity. "We've become so afraid to have people acknowledge the fact that the war in Iraq and Afghanistan has led to a spike in PTSD, we've become so afraid to talk about the fact that veterans are more likely to commit suicide," said Schaffner. "If we stop trying to keep people from seeking help, we'll be in a better financial position when it comes to understanding and treating this epidemic."

While much attention has been paid to the effect that post-traumatic stress has on young soldiers, the reality for veterans who struggle with the psychological effects of war is that it remains a serious problem for them, too.

Barry Westholm, former sergeant-major for the Joint Personnel Support Unit, left, and former Sgt. Michael Shiner hold a poster made by their organization, Task Force Westheim, that reads "Support our troops! Veterans are often forgotten by politicians." The poster is seen in a picture provided by the duo.

One of the most heartbreaking stories featured in "Soldier Whisperer" was that of Sgt. Michael Shiner and Sgt. Barry Westholm. Shiner and Westholm are not exactly an obvious pair of friends. For starters, Shiner is a convicted felon and Westholm spent eight months in prison for trying to steal his wife—and then, when she was found dead in the bathtub, told her mother he shot her. "He's a good guy, but he's also a guy who's still dealing with all of those same feelings and all the same things we still do in our lives," said Shiner. In fact, Shiner feels that he's not allowed to talk to him anymore.

The two men are sitting over a shared dinner table near the VA's downtown Toronto office, just over the old hospital buildings that have become a tourist attraction. Shiner has just left the military. He looks at the clock, and the table is starting to get a bit crowded around them, with six other members of his support team seated around the table, as well as another five of Shiner's close

; veterans speak about paperwork and bureaucracy and the need for more education. Barry Westholm, former sergeant-major for the Joint Personnel Support Unit, said that one way to mitigate suicide is to educate recruits on what VAC provides when they enlist, as opposed to having them navigate that system with a debilitating injury.

Not all military suicides were the result of deployment—31 per cent of U.S. military suicides weren't deployed in a combat zone, and Canadian statistics show a similar pattern. But the numbers suggest a causal link between combat and suicide. In the U.S. there is fear that the alarming rise in suicide rates after Iraq and Afghanistan (more than doubling between 2001 and 2006) has become the new normal. It was hoped that this was simply a spike, but the rates haven't gone down in the decade since, and remain roughly twice the civilian rate. In the American Civil War (1861-65), one of the first to provide data on suicide, the suicide rate was highest in the year after the fighting ended. It can take a while to manifest itself.

The 2015 CAF suicide report statistics indicate higher suicide risk in the last decade among those who have deployed.

"We haven't seen the worst of this," said
==================== COMPLETION 208 ====================
 Bruce Goldsby of The Family Leader. "We haven't seen the suicide rates go up, but we've seen very serious increase in serious incidents." In fact, there have been more than 150 deaths on the Canadian Armed Forces' books since 1995. While some are suicides, others are "incidents" in the military. According to Goldsby the problem is getting worse. "In 2003, we did something and we called it 'deployment stress.'" At the time, soldiers reported feeling "unstressed" after their tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the report has come up with data only since 2011 and the numbers don't indicate a dramatic change.

The Veterans Administration is still struggling to cope with veterans' suicide. "Veterans are dying all over this country. It's becoming epidemic," said Goldsby, who has written to Veterans Affairs Minister Erin O'Toole, calling for the department to do more. Goldsby also advocates for the release of data that would allow us to better assess suicides among our military. He says that, in a time of war, such information could not be kept secret. "If we knew what's going on with PTSD, we could find the best treatments and save more lives," Goldsby said.

The Canadian armed forces has taken a number of actions over the years to prevent suicides, but these are just small attempts. There needs to be a concerted national effort, with an emphasis on family, mentorship, stress management and PTSD. As part of the effort it would be helpful if we could see an overall decline in suicides over time. This could also include tracking how suicides are being prevented across the Armed Forces.

It would be helpful if we could see an overall decline in suicides over time.

There is an air of inevitability around the fact that military suicides are common, given the military's history. But it's a mistake to think that the military can control the problem. "It's the culture," said Goldsby. "Most of these suicides are coming from the individual. It's just that the military culture forces men to kill each other. If you can change that, it's possible."

For now, we're left with some worrying statistics that have to be considered. The 2015 CAF suicide report statistics indicate higher suicide risk in the last decade among those who have deployed. Perhaps this will change if we find a new way to combat our army's dark side.

The keynote speaker was John Oliver, a smart and funny man with a very distinct voice (which he uses for his HBO show). I had just seen an episode of his show based on a Snowden story. As I was sitting there listening to the story unfold, the video screen on my phone in the room started to shake (I believe this was Google's Nexus 6P, just a tad bit too heavy with the camera).

The shaking was accompanied by the sound of the screen going into standby mode. As the shaking continued, the screen was still spinning and I was still unable to focus on the program. I turned off the video from my phone and returned to staring into space.

As this happened I glanced to the left and noticed a man sitting close by staring straight ahead into space. I had no idea who I was looking at, but immediately recognized him as Stephen Colbert. As I turned back toward him, he winked. I laughed and thanked him for

Hi, everyone! I'm the leader at Asteria~Malice and we're looking to fill some spots.


Alliance Leader: Auguste (ID: 9rqyq, Line ID: embroideress)

Vice Leaders: Berserk and elle (job is shared and alternates between the two)

06:48 Valkyrie Crusade 48 Sleepy Hades LAW Rewards


Some additional info/rules:


1. Our minimum level requirement is level 50. Our current members' levels range from 74 to 200. Most of us have Rank All Time of under 1000 (including 12 with under 100) but there are also more casual players as well. Both experienced and newer players are welcome! Our alliance includes several rankers and we have a history of helping newer players become FAWKs and LAWKs! Motivated newer players are loved and tend to do especially well here.


2. Please be active! We're a casual alliance so there's no formal tracking but I do like to see signs that members log in and play at least a few times a week whether it's spawning LAWs, participating in ABB, or simply trying to collect the event cards. I can make allowances when people are busy with
==================== COMPLETION 209 ====================
 other activities and I try to keep the number of nights on the event card active at least a month, but there's absolutely no need for someone to be inactive unless they simply can't play. I also won't give any warning before a person has to wait a few hours.


3. Our alliance events are always starting at 5 PM and are generally a casual party, so members who are not able to log in are often dropped. If that is a deal breaker, please don't sign up. Our average member has around 4,000-5,000 Alliance Points, but it depends how many people sign up in a given hour and how active the members are. We usually have several alliances in one weekend and one or two active alliances during one week.


4. As a general rule, the amount of LEOs that join and end up joining our alliance will usually be around 30-40%. Since we are mostly an ABB alliance, our LEOs tend to be a lot more active than most! This is why I usually see much more LEOs in our alliance than I'd typically see elsewhere, so please help boost morale!


5. We have an optional, fun event that we do every Tuesday at 18:00 BST. It's called The Lawk Day in which players who want to participate can either try their hand at the various LEO and LAW challenges that are on offer. This is not a mandatory event but it is definitely encouraged and anyone is welcome to join.


6. The alliance is open to all players but we do have some "non-affluent" standards. We generally only want to promote law guilds and have at least one member from each alliance be involved with it in some way. You are welcome to help or just participate from time to time.


7. We also have a few other random events with varying levels of importance like a freebie for every alliance member that's logged into the game.


8. Alliance Leaders are responsible for setting up the event and for ensuring that guilds can participate in the event, but they do not have any power to change the content or the rules. This includes not wanting to do anything that the Alliance Leader feels may not be right/legitimate or that may upset other alliance members who believe differently.


Alliance Leaders are encouraged to post in this thread so that all guilds in the alliance know what rules are and they don't have to wait for the Alliance Leader to create an event thread. All members are required to read the event thread and be present for the event to be run and take part.


I hope that you find the requirements useful and feel appreciated if you take the time to sign up. If nothing else, you are more than welcome to invite any members, including new ones. The majority of guilds are very active but it also depends a lot on what the event is where you are and the members you invite.


Thank you for your continued support!<|endoftext|>If you're new here, you may want to check out my About page. Thanks for visiting!

==================== COMPLETION 210 ====================
 real-life events.


3. Make sure you know what your "Role" is! In the event the alliance reaches capacity then we'll put you in "Job". There are several jobs and it depends on their specific skills and attributes (which can be tweaked by the member for their particular role), but I will list them below under Job.


Here are the Job requirements and descriptions. PLEASE NOTE: If you've never flown a Valkyrie before we don't expect you to know what your job is. Don't worry! We'll tell you as soon as we get in a few more members.


Dread

A Valkyrie in the employ of the Dark Angel. She specializes in speed and agility. It's not uncommon for her to jump right into battle or to get straight to the front lines and take the fight to her enemies. Dread has no trouble jumping out of a wormhole as long as there's one.


Scout

A Valkyrie who is used to finding and killing targets. She's not skilled at killing opponents; she is, however, extremely effective at locating foes and helping allies kill enemies and neutral ground. A skilled Scout can lead her allies from a beacon and scout for hidden enemies. Scout is always available to assist in battle, even if it means running a dangerous mission.


Hunter

Hunters are those who specialize at eliminating targets from great distances. They take pride in hunting opponents, either from the safety of a cloak or to the very edge of their own bubble. Hunters take great pride in knowing where their opponents and allies are hiding, and for that reason they tend to use their abilities to keep opponents away from friendly ships and stations and even the front lines.


Brawler

A Valkyrie who specializes in close combat. She is fast enough to get in front of an opponent while others keep them at least a little bit away. Brawlers go into battle ready to fight, but rarely take any damage due to their ability to use their defense bubble for protection.


Skimmer

A Valkyrie who's main purpose is to get around quickly and sneak around for other purposes. Skimmers are capable of outmaneuvering opponents, though they're more concerned with hiding behind enemy shields and taking them out from behind and without firing their weapons.


Dread's role and abilities:


The Dread Job is a high adrenaline-based job. In the event we get in extra members they typically will have higher than average adrenaline levels. It's highly recommended that you learn the basic skills as it is the basis for all roles. Here's our skillset:


Dread

Hiding in the shadows a short distance behind enemy shields to dish out a lot of area damage.

Covering an area to allow other enemies to get to your ship before you arrive.

Being in a cloak to get stealthy.

Utilizing the Cloak ability to get into the most advantageous position and evade enemies.


Hunter

Hunting from the safety of a cloaked bubble.

Hunting by the edge of the battle to keep enemies at bay using abilities like Shield Penetration.

Using the Radar Scan and Stealth Scan abilities to find your opponents for a sneak attack.

Using the Defense bubble ability to protect yourself from enemy fire.


Brawler

Kiting your opponents and finding them before they get to your ship before killing them.

Defending yourself, as any skilled Brawler will.

Using the Shield Hardener to protect your ship from damage.


Skimmer

Fetching your friend back to your craft to help them while using the Radar Scan and Stealth Scan to identify your opponents for a Sneak Attack.

 other activities but I still expect you to be online at least 10 times a month!


3. We do not have a designated time slot that we play and this doesn't mean you should stop playing at any time other than when we are forming/joining. In some cases, we just have not been able to start a certain round of battles or have had a full schedule and will move players to another time slot if possible. If you want to change your time slot, please use the 'Rapport Info' in game or send me an invite.


4. Do not use the 'Leaderboards' button near the top of the alliance invite page for this.


5. Please use our 'Chat' button on the right corner of the bottom of the main page. This allows you to send an invitation, chat (also called "MOTD"/"Message to All" or "WELCOME"/"Greetings"), and leave private messages, all within the confines of our chat!


6. We will be starting a weekly server quest rotation shortly which will give us some extra people in the game to do quests as we're busy/inbetween the new raid and other events.


7. No stealing, cheating, and griefing! We don't require or even like someone who is already your friend to be your friend (I just want to be able to communicate with my friends in the future if we break up).


8. Please only join if you want to actually play with us. All members need to have at least 6/12 of the required items and at least 10 levels between 6400 and 9999. This includes items, levels and levels.


9. If you ever want to join an alliance that has similar rules, please check with any of your other alliance leaders to see if any of them would be interested. They may have better rules and maybe not have these.


10. I have a lot of rules but it's all about communication with me. If you have any questions about anything posted here feel free to ask and I'll answer it as soon as possible.


Hope to see you all in the future and thank you so much for your time.

The fourth only affects the faction you specifically have chosen.It's best to try the mods you have installed to ensure that there is no conflicts.- It's a plain-old console command! No special syntax needed. I really hope none of them can cause any trouble.- You can use these in combination with other mods or with eachother.- Some have issues with it (as is the case with most scripts). If they do, then I didn't find enough information about it (as of yet). If you have the same issues, please don't hesitate to tell me (either on steam or here).- The mod adds an in-game console command. (It's used in the first line of the console window)This mod shouldn't cause any issues because it just adds a bit of functionality in the main menus.If you found a compatibility or a potential problem, then please let me know. It's possible that it has something to do with a compatibility patch for some of the more popular mods out there. Please don't report it without the compatibility patch. It's possible that you are talking about two different things.In all the following console commands, there is always a space before the word "console".

Thousands gathered in downtown Salt Lake in reaction to the recent decision in a
======================================== SAMPLE 213 ========================================
 gasps of shock and audible comments of disapproval from some members of the audience. The audience's audible reactions were the direct result of the Prosecutor's provocative comments. The jurors also appeared shocked or surprised by the Prosecutor's statements. The audible reaction to the Prosecutor's improper comments disrupted the orderly and expeditious conduct of the trial. To restore appropriate decorum in the courtroom, the Court found it necessary to admonish the audience regarding outbursts.

Judge Bond sustained the inevitable objection and considered instructing the jury to disregard the conduct, but ultimately determined that a jury instruction could not cure the harm. That's when she sat down and looked at Johnson's behavior throughout her closing and began to suspect foul play, determining, "After reviewing the Prosecutor's actions throughout the trial and her behavior immediately before the Court ordered a mistrial, the Court does not believe Ms. Johnson's statements to the jury were made in the heat of battle or were the result of Ms. Johnson having a momentary lapse in judgment."

But that's not all!

During its cross-examination of the Defendant, the Prosecutor, Angela Weltin, directly violated the Court's Order granting a Motion in Limine. Despite having agreed to abide by the Court's Order granting the Motion
==================== COMPLETION 213 ====================
 in Limine, Ms. Weltin again engaged in inflammatory and irrelevant statements directed at the jury. For example, after admitting that the Defendant knew that she was entering into a plea of guilty, Ms. Weltin continued: "Did the Defendant have any idea that the plea agreement was an agreement to plead guilty and that she could not challenge the plea, either before the Court or before your Honors?" If the Defendant had been an "innocent" person who had never entered a plea of guilty, Ms. Weltin's claim to know that is simply false.

Ms. Weltin also went on to question, "Did the Defendant have any idea that pleading guilty was an acceptable outcome because she wanted to leave the courthouse without a problem, which ultimately occurred?" Ms. Weltin has been a member of the prosecution team since the beginning of the State's case. She should not have been permitted to continue such inflammatory statements. Her conduct during the Court proceedings was completely inappropriate.

This is where the Prosecutor took the Court's Order as legal immunity.

Weltin then proceeded to question the Judge.

Ms. Weltin: "How come the Prosecutor knew, before the Judge entered the plea, that she could not contest the plea agreement that the Defendant signed?" Judge Bond: "Because she knew the Defendant signed, and she knew the Defendant was going to plead guilty. I cannot tell you with absolute certainty why the Defendant agreed to plead guilty, but I know she did. I don't know where that came from, but that was the fact." Weltin: "If the Judge's Order were not a legal order, and if the Defendant could not contest the agreement as an innocent plea because she could not contest it before the Court, the Defendant would never have done it." Judge Bond: "No, the agreement was that the Defendant would plead guilty, and I can only tell you that the fact that the Defendant agreed, that she agreed when the Judge entered it, that she was making this agreement, that makes that agreement binding."

That's more than enough to take down this State's case (and it will).<|endoftext|>BANGKOK (Reuters) - More than 50 people were killed when an army helicopter crashed in Thailand's main river and Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra called an emergency cabinet meeting on Friday after a second disaster for the military government.

Yingluck arrived at the scene after troops from the elite Royal Thai Air Force were dispatched to inspect the downed helicopter, which had been carrying troops to a military camp as part of a training exercise.

"It was a major tragedy. I have just arrived at the scene, but what I can confirm is that the aircraft has crashed in the river," she told reporters at the accident site.

"The Army has made a recovery operation. I have ordered all necessary forces to take charge. I do not know the exact number of casualties. We just don't have the data yet."

Local media had earlier reported that 52 soldiers had been missing in the crash. Yingluck later said she had spoken to soldiers who were rescued from the helicopter.

More than 600,000 people have been killed since former strongman Thaksin Shinawatra came to power in 2005 and was ousted in a power struggle for succession.

Thais were left furious last year after the army, which takes over from the civilian government when a prime minister is ousted, killed dozens in violence that also led to the release of a prominent political analyst who had been imprisoned for five years.

The death toll from the second crash on Thursday rose to 61 on Friday, state television Chosun reported.

But that's not all!

During its cross-examination of the Defendant, the Prosecutor, Angela Weltin, directly violated the Court's Order granting a Motion in Limine. Despite having agreed to abide by the Court's Order granting the Motion
==================== COMPLETION 214 ====================
 in Limine, the Prosecutor repeatedly sought to contradict and overrule the Court's decision in the Prosecutor's Motion in Limine. The Prosecutor asked the Judge if the Court had ever before allowed a defense counsel the right to question the prosecution counsel about improper and potentially prejudicial tactics employed by the prosecution and even offered to tell the Court what she did with her "spoils of war." The Court had previously stated that it did not allow counsel to take out "spoils" from counsels. Yet, Ms. Weltin, in her motion in limine, stated that she had obtained information from a source that "a person or persons employed by Defendant's counsel obtained weapons and ammunition from Defendant" and from "courier[s] working on Defendant's behalf" during the time that the Prosecutor's office was "working with Plaintiff-Appellee's defense counsel." Again, the order that she obeyed was her own.

On the Defendant's second day of testimony, in an attempt to undermine and intimidate the jury during the hearing on the motion to dismiss the indictment, Judge Bond found the Defendant to have been "uncooperative" and "irresolute" during her testimony. Acknowledging that she had already heard the Defendant speak in more than four hours on the phone, Judge Bond stated, "I have now asked [the Judge] to rule on Plaintiff's motion in limine as to Defendant's uncooperation, irresoluteness, unresponsive, and even belligerent testimony and find the Defendant to be in violation of the State's motion in limine, and dismiss the indictment."

Judge Bond told the Defendant that "in light of Plaintiff's inability to cross-examine [her] at the last day of this trial, and the evidentiary hearing that the Court is holding this afternoon, it is my determination that the Defendant's testimony is at this time not reasonably calculated to produce a verdict in this case." (The Judge also told the Defendant that the Defendant "may be considered by the Court to answer questions but not to testify.")

Then she told the Defendant that the Prosecutor and her "spoils of war" strategy were not going to work again and that she would have to find another lawyer.

"I will not permit an uncooperative and belligerent witness who is unwilling to answer the questions posed by Ms. Weltin to be any part of the trial in this case," the Judge stated. "In closing statements to the jury, Ms. Weltin made statements that were improper. And as a direct rebuttal from Defendant, she stated she was going to destroy the case."

This is a very, very scary story.

If you think police officers who shot unarmed people who posed no threat to them will be held to the same standards we apply to them, think again. As reported by the Los Angeles Times, in 2010 Officer Andrew Thomas was acquitted of all charges in the death of a young father named Jonathan Ferrell.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office charged Thomas with second-degree murder in connection with Ferrell's Oct. 21, 2008, fatal shooting on a freeway. Ferrell, a football player at the University of Alabama, was found with a Taser in his waistband. Thomas was traveling at about 15 mph when he spotted Ferrell's Dodge Durango, a car with an outstanding speeding ticket. The car's taillights were out while the car's engine was running. Thomas pursued the car after it left the freeway at Sunset and South Whittier avenues. The chase ended a few blocks from the site of the shooting. Thomas found Ferrell on South Whittier Avenue about a quarter-mile from his car. According to testimony earlier in

Judge Bond sustained the inevitable objection and considered instructing the jury to disregard the conduct, but ultimately determined that a jury instruction could not cure the harm. That's when she sat down and looked at Johnson's behavior throughout her closing and began to suspect foul play, determining, "After reviewing the Prosecutor's actions throughout the trial and her behavior immediately before the Court ordered a mistrial, the Court does not believe Ms. Johnson's statements to the jury were made in the heat of battle or were the result of Ms. Johnson having a momentary lapse in judgment."

 in Limine, the Prosecutor violated it by not only testifying that the Defendant did not take Ms. Johnson's statements seriously, but also making it known that the Defendant had the opportunity to take part in the final discussion before the decision was reached in that regard.

So, the jury found him guilty anyway, and now he's going to jail anyway.

Well, no shit.

UPDATE 11/1 from the St. Petersburg Times:

Judge Bond's decision came after some controversial testimony from the prosecution and defense about the nature of Ms. Johnson's feelings. At times, her voice quavered, and her demeanor became somber as jurors heard some shocking statements about her relationship in the weeks and months before the shooting. "I did not make a big deal about it," she said in one particularly emotional moment. She continued to ask for her life to be spared when the prosecutor pointedly asked if she had taken her feelings to prosecutors because of the shooting. Prosecutors said they believed she did, and that "she was not taking this case seriously." Jurors heard Ms. Johnson tell her husband on Sept. 10 that she was going to kill herself the next day. On Sept. 12, the prosecutor said that Ms. Johnson went to a bathroom with her gun and the phone. "There's no way in hell she would have killed herself without the gun," the prosecutor said.<|endoftext|>(Mental Floss) -- In the year 1885, the University of Chicago hired Charles H. Lawton -- the country's first professor of physical chemistry -- as an assistant. By all accounts, he wasn't the brightest or most productive member of the department, but at least he had an innate understanding of physics. Today, scientists still refer to an apparatus Lawton created as a "Lawon chamber," after the scientist who first conceived it. In the Lawon chamber, students stand in the middle of an area of pure water as drops of acid and alkali enter the chamber through two transparent tubes on opposite sides. A series of graduated "drops" come from one side and go into a container containing the opposite side. When the drops hit another glass tube, they bounce around briefly, dissipating the acid and alkali. When this occurs, the student on the opposite side stands in the center of the water; the drops go through her, too. The student then brings a drop to the top tube and sets it down in her tube. The drop bounces back, and it too dissipates the acid and alkali. To see if the law of conservation of force applies in this process, the student stands in the center of the pool of water while the other side stands in the center of her tube; the drop goes through her. The drops then fall into the center of the room where they are captured by a tiny water droplet in one of the glass tubes. If two drops from one side of the Lawon chamber return to the opposite side, they will form a chain. The Lawon chamber is a well-known scientific illustration demonstrating the conservation of energy. It was used in physics textbooks until the 1970s, when students began to question whether an actual physical phenomenon could explain the law of conservation.

The idea that conservation of energy is an illusion dates back at least to 1798, when German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz suggested the idea that the law of conservation of energy could be "explained" in terms of a mechanism of conservation of momentum. The problem with this explanation is that momentum is an illusion -- particles in a system that is held perfectly still are, in fact, not. The idea of momentum conservation, like the Lawon-chamber effect, is now understood as a result of experiments in

But that's not all!

During its cross-examination of the Defendant, the Prosecutor, Angela Weltin, directly violated the Court's Order granting a Motion in Limine. Despite having agreed to abide by the Court's Order granting the Motion
==================== COMPLETION 216 ====================
 in Limine, the prosecutor failed to provide an adequate response by the Court's deadline or during the trial, and was in violation of the Court's Order.

It's not just the courtroom and courtroom decorum, either. It's the law. There's a very simple way to find out whether your testimony might have been affected by the defendant acting in a manner that's outside their legal personality. If the defendant acts in a manner that's outside their personality, the judge can't make a finding that is outside your personality, even if that's what the court believes was your true objective.

That's right, the prosecutor in that case not only violated the Court's Order, she violated the Court's order because she did it in a way that didn't respect the Judge's order from which she had been excluded and which granted her motion in limine. Not cool.

Judge Bond and Judge Jones's instructions for the jury on the basis of the Prosecutor's behavior were the right ones for this case. They should be taught by everyone who teaches law.

But at what cost?

Justice Jones gave a great statement to the media that evening at a news conference with his fellow District Attorney, Kenneth Acker. But that doesn't appear on this transcript. The Judge issued a press conference statement later that evening. But I guess the media and even some of the press and newsmen did not have the interest or inclination to attend the news conference on December 3, 2017.

That's the story of the case with regard to Angela Weltin, and there is still much to be learned.

But I want to emphasize one other thing.

In the final days of the trial and with regard to the prosecutor's improper behavior, Judge Bond called the media to explain the case to her. She explained the events, her reasons for finding the behavior improper, and why the court should have allowed a mistrial and how the court's order was not violated. She was also very straightforward in her statement that the prosecutor violated the Court's Order when she testified.

In the days that followed, both Judge Jones and Judge Bond issued public statements to explain and apologize for their respective roles in the case. Both judges said the actions of Angela Weltin were wrong. And they both said they accepted responsibility for that wrongfulness.

But if she had gotten away with what she did in this case?

Why is it called the "dick move?"

The term dick move refers to an action in an online game that is usually a slight improvement to an already powerful attack or tactic. This is a way to show off the strength of another player against your opponent, to taunt the other player into making a mistake.


This is essentially the way a lot of the newer and higher level "Tekken" fighting games work. While the original Tekken game from the Dreamcast/PS2/PC era of the fighting game is a great game, some people feel it's too old or too simple. So instead of going the hard core route

Sacred clowns are adept at uniting joy with pain, acting on the higher and more inscrutable imperatives of the Great Mystery. They tend to govern transition, introduce paradox, blur boundaries, and mix the sacred with the profane. They are called upon to reestablish the bridge between the physical and spiritual worlds. They dare to ask the questions that nobody wants answers to.

 the ways we live our lives while maintaining our fundamental humanity. The trick is to never stop trying to do more than we are asked to do, and to live each day as if it were the only day in the universe.

Sacred Clowns are like a clownish, almost comedic reflection of the human condition within the system. They can see human frailty, lack of self-identity, and a complete refusal to accept any form of reality that doesn't align with their beliefs.

The trick, of course, is to avoid any form of personal reflection that doesn't line up with an external worldview or ideology. The trick, in other words, is to avoid doing anything that could challenge the foundation of the system you're living within. They are perpetually in a perpetual state of "unfocusing" because they are perpetually moving from one belief system to another.

Unlike many types of "religious" clowns, sacred clowns tend to be agnostic to any organized religion or dogma. They may not even believe in gods; they may simply not care.

They are the eternal rebels. As long as they operate within the rules of the system they are living in, they are free. They do not ask for the blessing of the gods, but may have a spiritual relationship with the spirits they encounter that is not bound by any strict moral code.

Sacred clowns are often described as spiritual and often are described as having a spiritual connection with animals. Some sacred clowns, depending on the situation, may be able to communicate with spirits called The Four Corners of the Usuki-Wakahashi System, which is a system of Japanese mythology.

This is the primary spiritual manifestation of a sacred clown.

The Four Corners are a part of Japanese myth that tell of four spirits that represent the four main aspects of life and death, the four phases of life, and the cycle of rebirth.

The Four Corners are:

The Spirit of Life. Life comes from death. The spirit of life contains this cycle. They serve as the spirits of life and death.

The Spirit of the Dead. When a person dies, their spirit is in the spirit world. When they die they are born again. They serve as the spirits of dead creatures. Like a human child, the dead creature is reborn and lives on as a spirit of a new creature. When one dies, the spirits of all people are present and may be viewed through a window in the spirit world.

The Spirit of Death. When a person dies, their body is removed from this cycle. It is placed into the world of spirits. The spirit of death, as a part of this cycle, represents death. Once a person dies, their spirit is taken away, and they are reborn into a new cycle. Once a person dies, the spirit of this cycle is removed from the world of the living. They are also left behind. One may reincarnate into one's own race through this cycle.

The Spirit of Rebirth. The cycle of death and rebirth continues.

These are all four layers of life. Only the Four Corners represent the cycles of life. These spirits, which are all part of the spirit world, embody the four phases of life.

These spirits may also be referred to as the spirit of the moon, the spirit of time, or time itself. Some say that these spirits are a sort of combination of a woman and a man. They are often described as being of the feminine spirit and male spirit. It has been suggested that the spirits of the ghosts of women may serve as the guardians of the tomb.

The Four Corners also represent Death of the Law. This is the only law

==================== COMPLETION 218 ====================
. Even though they are bound by convention, sacred clowns are not afraid to ask, "whoa, that isn't really what's expected of me or my group." They have no illusions about reality, no pretense that they know the answer to everything. Yet, just as the sacred fool doesn't know anything, neither do sacred clowns. They simply have an insatiable curiosity and a strong sense of curiosity about the world that is often too strong to control.

Sacred clowns are highly sensitive about their public image. They know how easy it is to put down someone else's ideas, and how it feels when other people see their personal failings. They may be so used to hiding their flaws (the only fault their sacred image is bound to possess) that they can easily forget that they have them. As a result, sacred clowns can often find themselves in dire need of the other side of being "different" — acceptance. They understand the value of helping others become comfortable with their own imperfections.

They are quick to notice and acknowledge the flaws and contradictions in the people around them. They will often make friends with those who seem to be a little out of reach, even if there's nothing in particular that they have at all in common. If you ask sacred clowns how to meet people who don't understand them, their answer may surprise you:

"I don't really know, I guess just try to be interesting. Don't be too obvious that you're different."

Sacred clowns are curious about the world beyond their reality. They often spend hours in bookstores and libraries, looking up obscure facts or looking for patterns. They are drawn to the strangest, the most peculiar, the most exotic. They spend their time in the library, researching odd subjects they wouldn't normally care about. While they may be a bit offbeat in their own right, they love a good mystery, and it makes them very eager to find the most obscure knowledge out there. They like books about weird things that aren't normal. They don't really like normal things. They are constantly looking to get as close to the strange that they can get.

Sacred clowns have trouble understanding the abstract and "spiritual" elements of the human psyche. They try to rationalize what's real to them with the rational, often feeling they are missing something important. They often find it difficult to explain their inner lives and the complexities of their inner world. That's partly because they are so used to explaining them to themselves.

While there is no shortage of rationalizations for the mind, sacred clowns are very sensitive about their understanding of what is rational and what's not. They often struggle with being misunderstood or being misunderstood — it gives them anxiety when they think they are being misunderstood and don't know what to make of it. Because they are sensitive about their own motivations, they tend to feel a need to protect their image.

That's not to say they will lie about anything or anyone else; they simply prefer to let themselves be drawn out of their protective shells, as opposed to keeping themselves in place. You might call it a desire to lose themselves, or be fully themselves if they can — but no matter what they try to do, it never really works out for them.

Sacred clowns don't let anyone take away their secrets. It is always difficult for them to be completely open and honest, as they are so sensitive about being perceived as someone who is trying to cover something up. That's unfortunate for those who want to exploit or control them. They have few, if any, allies, except when it comes to sharing their deepest secrets. They're not too concerned if they are misunderstood, and they often find

, often in ways that defy our expectations. Because they are not constrained to any particular place, city, or creed, sacred clowns are able to make the most drastic social and political decisions.

Because sacred clowns are the embodiment of the Trickster archetype, they make people uncomfortable. Some people may have an innate, emotional affinity with sacred clowns, and there may be those who look to them as a source of hope, but the bulk of humanity, on the whole, feels discomforted by sacred clowns. They have the potential to provoke a certain level of anger and uneasiness.

Sacred clowning is the act of attempting to use clowning to make change.

Sacred clowning can be quite dangerous, or life-threatening, because it involves a dangerous and dangerous act. That act can be quite shocking and shocking can be dangerous. People who commit a crime using the tools of clowning could face a considerable amount of prosecution.

The greatest danger to sacred clowners comes from themselves. People who engage in destructive, destructive behavior often find it hard to admit that their actions are not the result of self-medication or self-preservation. Some sacred clowns are capable of inflicting profound injury upon themselves simply by going too far with their behavior. They become so intoxicated with their power or self-image, that they lose their ability to recognize and appreciate the damage they are doing to themselves. If they cannot acknowledge their folly, then even their own actions can be too much for them. They will sometimes take their own life.

This doesn't make it any less tragic or tragic for those who may attempt to live out sacred clown roles well. Most people can't imagine that they can live up to the demands of a role that is supposed to represent wisdom and nobility. Some people just can't handle that.

In The Complete Idiot's Guide to Being a Sacred Clown: A Survival Manual (1997), Carl Jung writes:

"The Sacred Clown, who lives in defiance of the strictures of the public life, is an impure and corrupt individual: he is a fraud, a fraud who can't live up to his role, who doesn't recognize his own folly and impurity. He does not recognize his responsibility in leading the world or in setting a good example. His path is a path of ruin. He can't resist the temptation, and he does too much, and has to go too far."

Even some people who don't identify as sacred clowns are capable of carrying out the roles when they are not fully aware of their implications. Some individuals take full advantage of their ability to transcend and transcend their role.

This, however, is often a form of masochism. Sacred clowning is difficult and often exhausting and therefore often leads to individuals living life as a kind of caricature of the sacred clown archetype. If you are not careful, you can end up sacrificing both your body and your soul by becoming a sacred clown.

The archetypal clown is a misfit. People who play that role are often the least successful and most troubled of people, usually for deeply rooted reasons, like having been rejected as a child and feeling a lot of anxiety.

They're not necessarily evil, though sometimes they come across as like an evil child. They usually have no sense of honor, or even respect for themselves, which often comes across as cold. These clowns often appear "moody". Even a benign sense of humor can be difficult for them.

They sometimes appear cruel, manipulative, and callous. As a result, people who are sacred clowns can sometimes be perceived to be cruel or manipulative toward others. Some people who are sacred clowns are capable of murdering children

. They are not cynical cynics. They don't have the same sense of doom and finality.

These beings are born to embody a certain amount of pain and anxiety because of our species' innate desire to identify with things, people and places – and because that's all we know. Without the need for explanation, we have no understanding and can't make sense of the situation we find ourselves in – not that it needs explaining. When you are confronted with seemingly incomprehensible and chaotic outcomes, the human tendency is to latch onto those things and assume them to be universal rules. We assume that these rules apply everywhere and are absolute. Sacred clowns, though, know that even our assumptions are subject to change, and that this change can often be good.

"When we understand something new, it may have nothing in common with what we were taught. It is as if the sky were to suddenly change color; the sea suddenly turn into a vast, unearthly sea in the distance; the earth became two-footed and moved on two legs."

We must accept that the entire universe exists as a constant state of flux. We are not omniscient in the world, and we fail in every single endeavor we set our fingers on. Because of that, there are things we take for granted we can never understand or fully comprehend. The sacred clowns teach us not to rely on these assumptions and to always have a sense of "otherness" with everything we do. This is why many of them take on the form of a clown, often as children. They don't want to conform to the expectations of some society, nor is there room for them in a world ruled by conformity. It's one step from the circus, but a big and important step nonetheless.

We are a species built upon the principle of freedom, self-determination, and the pursuit of knowledge, which makes us uniquely equipped to make sense of chaos. These are traits we've spent trillions of years perfecting, and that we need to maintain in a world that seeks to keep us bound with dogma and fear.

In a world that's constantly at war, it's imperative to maintain the integrity of the truth, which is something our ancestors were not suited to do. Sacred clowns are able to channel or subvert this imperative. "You're crazy. That doesn't make sense." Because if the world is being run by fools and idiots, that means it's working. It's a strange and beautiful thing to recognize our own shortcomings and shortcomings, and to realize that they're not necessarily a burden, but in fact a strength. "When we understand something new, it may have nothing in common with what we were taught. It is as if the sky were to suddenly change color; the sea suddenly turn into a vast, unearthly sea in the distance; the earth became two-footed and moved on two legs."

Sacred clowns don't need us to believe them. They can be trusted. They don't need to be afraid. Their existence says that life is a journey. All we have to do is join in. They give us hope that there's something good in the world. They teach us to recognize and follow our intuition.

While they don't always agree with us, they are happy to lead us toward our goals. It is important to remember that as humans, we are meant to walk alone. When we are confronted with seemingly incomprehensible and chaotic outcomes, the human tendency is to latch onto those things and assume them to be universal rules. We assume that these rules apply everywhere and are absolute. Sacred clowns, though, know that even our assumptions are subject to change, and that this change can often be good.

Facts such as these drive home the truth that Kishanji was captured in some other place, tortured to death and then his dead body was placed on the spot and a drama concocted in defence of the so-called encounter theory. The WB chief minister, after keeping mum for three days came out with a theory at a by-election campaign meeting that the joint forces told Kishanji over the microphone to surrender before shooting him down—a claim refuted by the villagers themselves in their conversation with the 22-member investigation team formed by civil rights bodies that visited the spot and adjoining areas on 1 December 2011. And this so-called encounter was engineered at a time when the process of dialogue between the government interlocutors and the Maoist state leadership of WB was on. The revolutionary intellectual, Varavara Rao, one member of the group that came to take Kishanji's body to his native Peddapally town in Karimnagar district, declared that for the last 43 years he had been witnessing dead bodies—killed either in real or fake encounters—but never before was he the witness to a body that bore marks of so much injury.
==================== COMPLETION 221 ====================
 Such a body was buried. But the Maoists did exactly the same thing and buried as well. In the case of Bikram Singh it took more than 200 hours for a body to be buried—two days after it was supposedly killed.

The fact that the WB and the Maoists were not ready to meet any of the human rights and political groups led to a massive campaign by the latter to ensure that the bodies are not buried. And there are reports that the dead bodies of the 10 bodies had been cremated on 17 December 2011—and the remains of Bikram Singh's body was not deposited with his family in Peddapally for some days. The villagers who have seen the dead bodies, the families of Kishanji's wife and his son, feel that the dead would be better off being buried, as their bones would be preserved. All in all, it is possible that the bodies of these soldiers would remain buried too.

Some experts say that the WB should take full responsibility for the human rights violations that are occurring in the region, including on the issue of human sacrifices. They also feel that there should be a judicial inquiry into the deaths of these 10 soldiers. But there is nothing like that yet, because the investigation team comprising two judicial commissions and six judicial officers of different ranks has not set foot on the land where the 10 "sadhus" were allegedly massacred. This means that there is still no inquiry into these killings.

It also means that no body is ready. Kajaria (name changed), son of a landless farmer, is among them.

Kajaria was 17 when he was abducted from his house in Peddapally town. Kishi Bashi was one of the places that Maoists identified as a place of their "reserve." Kajaria was allegedly abducted and was taken to other Maoist strongholds in Darbhanga district of Bihar, where the Naxalites took him to an unknown place. His family says that he was taken to Lohara in the West Bengal and then to the Burdwan district of West Bengal. Kajaria says that for four months, till he was handed over to a group of unidentified men, he was tortured by the Maoists by being raped and then burnt alive. (When contacted by The Hindu, Maoists denied that they had committed mass crimes, and termed the accounts of alleged mass killings as a "hoax.")

Kajaria's body was also thrown in the Ganga for a few days after he had been murdered, allegedly by Maoists. The family has also complained about how the dead bodies were thrown in the Ganga. Kajaria's relative says he and other relatives of Kishanji are still not getting any help from the government. In the middle of the night on 1 November when they came to know a team of three "inquiry teams," including the one headed by a judge from Central Bureau of Investigation, was trying to reach the place where the bodies of two police personnel had fallen, the villagers rushed out to save the bodies and stopped their vehicle. After the police team left the spot, the villagers returned but the bodies were not collected as the government was taking no action. All the villagers had wanted was the government to investigate the matter so that their loved ones could have relatives laid to rest in peace. "I am just a poor peasant—the poor of Karimnagar and District Magu," Kajaria said. "Kishanji must have had an impact on all of us, because everyone who had something to do with him was killed."

Kishanji—who was arrested in February 2003 and jailed for 25 months—is still alive. He was released on parole

The encounter of 22 November 2011

On 1 December, villagers of a village called Kishanji and of neighbouring Kothampal village had their dead bodies buried to make them eligible to the Peddapally by-election held on 16 December 2011 for WB's third assembly constituency, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh's Varanasi district. The by-poll was called after the BJP won Varanasi parliamentary seat in 2009 by a massive margin of more than 6K. The BJP government took charge in Varanasi in November 2010 with a target to win 80 seats in the next assembly election in 2013. With the BJP taking a commanding position to win more than 80 seats, it was a certainty that the WB would be included in the BJP's target list. The WB chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, appointed a three-member advisory group headed by retired SP B Saini, and with the support of the Congress government of Kalyan Singh of Delhi led by Chandrashekhar Bawankule, to monitor the process of dialogue with the Maoist state leadership to bring the conflict to an end.

But the government never had any confidence in the Maoist leadership, not even after the Naxalite insurgency had reached new heights, which had led to the deaths of more than 8,000 people and injured more than 50 lakh.

"For the last 43 years I have been witnessing dead bodies but never once have I witnessed a body that bore marks of so much injury", a villager told Frontline in an interview. At 11.00 am on 1 December, the group left Kishanji to visit other villages, where they found Kishanji's body lying dead, beaten to pulp along with a long trail of blood. The jawbone, arm and neck bone had been broken, and the right hand and fingers were missing. The back of the skull was fractured and the nose and ear had turned purple. The villagers took the body to the house of Nand Kumar who immediately took it to a field in Peddapally and buried it under the soil. But some villagers were unhappy about this. They also lodged complaints with the Varanasi SP's team that had been formed to monitor the process of dialogue. Nand Kumar told Frontline that those present with him at that time also told him that they had heard one of the villagers say that he had seen a 'Naxal', who they suspected was Kishanji lying dead on the floor. On 13 December, the SP and other members of the team arrived at Kishanji and found the village in a jumble of bodies. They had first heard of the killing of a boy two days before and then realised that it had happened in Kishanji. But they did not go immediately to the village to investigate. "We waited for three days to gather information. Then we went to the Peddapally (Washimmal) and reached the family of the dead body, but the family refused to talk. Eventually we went back to Kishanji. It's the villagers who have confirmed that the body was of Kishanji who was killed by the Naxals", says SP B Saini.

In an interview with Frontline in Dindigul on 16 December, 2011, Saini said: "The villagers have told us that the body of a boy was found near the village. It is too early to conclude that the body belonged to Kishanji. It is not our job to draw up the conclusions as to the cause of death. It's a crime to murder a person. The villagers were in their own homes and came to see the deceased lying in the field, and they

Facts such as these drive home the truth that Kishanji was captured in some other place, tortured to death and then his dead body was placed on the spot and a drama concocted in defence of the so-called encounter theory. The WB chief minister, after keeping mum for three days came out with a theory at a by-election campaign meeting that the joint forces told Kishanji over the microphone to surrender before shooting him down—a claim refuted by the villagers themselves in their conversation with the 22-member investigation team formed by civil rights bodies that visited the spot and adjoining areas on 1 December 2011.

This was the first such encounter of a CM who was in a position of authority for three years. Rao said on Sunday that the police had not given any explanation after his delegation visited the spot and adjoining areas. "This is a conspiracy to cover up for what the CM had done. The CM had taken action to take back his territory. I have asked him to explain why we are allowed to bury dead bodies," he said. But this is just one of the findings to emerge from the report of the probe, conducted by a group of 14, headed by a retired military officer, Lt-Gen K Sankaranarayanan, headed by former Chief of Army Staff Bikram Singh Ghatak in cooperation with Naxalbari villagers.

While the Naxalbari village that the CPI(M) took custody of on 16 July 2011 when the uprising first broke out was not in the same district of Chhattisgarh as the area under investigation, many of the most important points of the confrontation had taken place in the neighbouring district of Dantewada which witnessed a massacre of Naxalbari villagers by the Naxal-inspired Naxalites on 11 October 2011—the first encounter in the so-called 'Maoist-hit' area. And then too we come to the most significant of facts—the manner in which this confrontation was captured and how the CM of the neighbouring state of West Bengal handled the matter afterwards.

The government of West Bengal had given a statement on 2 September 2012 in the Supreme Court that it had been able to negotiate a surrender of Kishanji with the central government and that it was to get the body in Chhattisgarh for burial at a national level military cemetery as per the protocol of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). The CM, on the other hand, had denied to the Naxalbari villagers on 15 July 2011 that he had come to a compromise with the central government and the central government had denied permission to the WB authorities for burial at Chhattisgarh. A local media report had also quoted BSF Chief DK Rautela as saying that he did not receive instructions from the Centre or the local government to hand over the body to the WB authorities and that the body was sent to West Bengal for burial as per the protocol of AFSPA.

However, this was not the first encounter in the Maoist-hit area where the CM had had to backtrack. On 27 May 2011, four months after the initial encounter, he had to say in the Lok Sabha that he had spoken with the then WB Chief Minister C Narayan Prasad Yadav who assured him that he would hand over the body of Kishanji to the government of Chhattisgarh "within 24 hours", he had said. However, a week later the CM had to say in the Lok Sabha that he had "failed to deliver the order as the request from the state for giving the body to us was refused by the state's security personnel".

At the end of 2011, a delegation comprising 10 men of the CPI(M) had reached Gwalior, the state capital of Chhattisgarh, to take custody of the body. There was no word, however, about why that delegation had decided to take control of Kishanji's body from the Army in the first place. For one, some of the CPI(M) men had been to meet Prasad Yadav. For another, the visit to Gwalior was made before a decision on the body was taken between the WB and the state government. Also, an officer of the army had been brought on the same trip and was not given charge of protecting

 He said he was compelled to seek action from the government, especially after the WB government formed the probe team. "It was on the way when I saw a dead body with bullets wounds in its body," Rao said. "When I asked who killed him, they said there were some elements in the paramilitary forces with them."

In a statement issued to The Hindu on Sunday night, the WB government refuted the allegations made by Rao and said there was no case against it. "There was no incident of fake encounter in Gidli village on 10th December, 2011 when such statements were made in this press meet. The investigation carried out by the state government has proved that there was no encounter on 10th December, 2011," it said.

Rajeswari Pratap Das, the then-DCP (intelligence) and the chief investigating Officer of the inquiry team, said he received a complaint in November 2011 that three civilians, Nand Kumar Yadav, Sushanta Srivastava and Tushar Khatik, had been kidnapped and were in trouble with military intelligence officials who had a strong presence in the area. "So on 11th November, at 7am, I had taken the following two groups to investigate the missing of three civilians. But neither they were detained nor any arrest made. The three had been living in Kishanji area for last 15 days. They were released from hospital after the inquiry team visited their house. The investigation team met the three on 12 December, 2011 at Peddapally at about 10:15am", he said.

Bhai Ram, a retired school teacher, and his wife had been held by a group of Maoists on 10 December 2011 and kept in Peddapally for ten days. Ram and Devi Devi, his sister-in-law, told The Hindu that at about 11.55am they heard a group of about a dozen personnel passing by on motorbike. "After that we heard a conversation in Peddapally. They gave a different version. After which they told us that three civilians kidnapped by security forces had died of their injuries and two others were missing. On our request, police team went to their house at Peddapally on 8 December", they said.

Ram added that after returning from Peddapally the family went to the site of Kishanji killing where they saw the body of Sushanta Srivastava. "He was injured while being shot. His body showed his bullet wounds", he said. Khatik's body, meanwhile, was lying on a road next to the road from Peddapally to Gidli. "We told villagers and police that they had been abducted and taken to this remote location in Peddapally in which there was a tree at which they were kept, which had also got its own name, 'Para Dhanush'," he said.

Ram said villagers told the police that on 8 December, after the body of Srivastava was placed on the road, one of them, Nand Kumar Yadav, along with two men, including his grandson Ashok Kumar, ran to the tree and took shelter from a cold wind.

On 9 December 2011 a group of policemen led by DSP Chanda said they had recovered a letter from Khatik's house that had been written by Kishanji. In his letter Kishanji had described being led by five men to a road and told about two dead police personnel. "He (Kishanji) mentioned the two officers on the ground and the man who had told them about the officer, his nephew Ashok. Later, he said a woman officer had asked him to hand over the letter and

But Portland is moving to ease its restrictions on short-term rentals, perhaps easing the way for the hundreds of residents with listings on Airbnb and other sites like it to come out of the shadows — if they're willing to pay a permit fee and collect lodging taxes.

Cities all over the world are struggling with how to confront the groundswell of off-the-books vacation rentals facilitated by online middlemen, which are riddled with regulatory and policy concerns.

One-off rentals don't drive employment or tax revenue like hotels, and they can supplant what would otherwise be affordable long-term housing. Private homes also aren't subject to the safety regulations hotels are, and neighbors can find the revolving door of strangers unnerving.

Some municipalities have cracked down. New York, for example, passed a law in 2011
==================== COMPLETION 225 ====================
 forbidding short-term vacation rentals as of April 1, 2013. Seattle Mayor Ed Murray signed a similar ordinance in June, but it only covers those who list their home on the site and offer less than 30 days' notice the next time they leave.

Portland, meanwhile, has not taken action.

For years, the city has tried to deal with the problem of off-street rentals by requiring hotels and commercial establishments to register with the city as bed and breakfast or lodging places, but there can be delays, the agency has acknowledged.

In Portland, Airbnb and other websites are a way to make a living, letting people rent out their properties and earn extra cash from rentals.

Portland officials are eager to tackle these issues.

It's not surprising that the city is considering new standards. Some local Airbnb hosts have been complaining that they're not paying a portion of their lodging taxes or applying lodging taxes to tourists staying on their property.

"We need to address the impacts of our transient population on communities," interim Police Chief Mike Marshman said in an email last month.

In 2014, more than 1,500 rentals were listed on Airbnb in the Portland area. The city says they generated more than $50,000 in taxes and fees for the city this year.

More than 9,000 Airbnb listings were advertised in Portland in October — a 40 percent increase from the number for the same month in 2013. Airbnb has more than 1,200 listings, and it reported about $25 million in local revenue in 2014, of which about $10 million came from lodging taxes. The company said it expects a total of $55 million this year due to more listings and increased demand to rent out properties.

The biggest cities, like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, have taken the broadest approach, requiring the registration of all vacation rentals.

A recent study by researchers at UC Berkeley and the University of California, Berkeley, found that local lodging taxes generated $32.6 million in 2013 and more than $4.2 million per city during the first five years of California's bed tax.

Airbnb spokeswoman Liz Toppo said she believes cities should be trying to create greater efficiencies and avoid burdening local hosts with more regulations and taxes. Other studies have shown that short-term rentals encourage more residents to rent, and can make housing affordable to people who can't otherwise afford it.

"For many years, Portland has been pushing hard to open up neighborhoods to Airbnb — not just in the city proper but all of the city," she said. "The numbers speak for themselves. What I do believe is that our laws need to align or we need to look at new measures to make sure that we're serving folks. That's really what we're interested in."

Airbnb, though, argues that the city should regulate its listings to ensure their quality or make them impossible to rent.

"It has become apparent in the past few years that Airbnb has been a significant source of illegal housing and has contributed to the rising costs of rent for hundreds of thousands of renters," the company said in an emailed statement. "While Portland has a longstanding ordinance that requires hosts and guests to register their property with the city to ensure compliance with the state's lodging tax law, Airbnb has said that it wants to regulate itself, and the city has accepted that proposal. The question the public doesn't seem to want answered, though, is how should we ensure our community stays safe and meets its commitment to affordable housing?"

City officials have long argued they don't need zoning to address the problem. The issue came up this year in a lawsuit Airbnb filed against the city.

Under a proposed city rule, however, homeowners renting less

 that imposes a $5,000 permit fee on any resident who rents out their unit for more than seven days a year, or $5,000 in any 12 consecutive months.

Portland already has limits on short-term rentals, prohibiting rentals that aren't classified as hotels, and those already renting out entire units in multiple units must be in a building that has a permit, according to a 2015 report by the Planning and Sustainability Commission.

But the 2016 draft of the proposed hotel industry regulations has an extra layer of regulation designed to try to keep Airbnb out of the City Hall debate over the future of the hotel industry.

The measure would require companies like Airbnb and Homeaway to apply for a permit to operate a short-term rental unit in or on a property that they own or manage, or on a property with more than five units.

The city would only issue permits to companies that have a record of compliance, and to properties operating within the city's zoning codes, said Peter Harriman, interim director of the Commission on Planning and Sustainability.

The measure would, for the most part, avoid restricting where short-term rental properties could operate, because the city would be issuing permits to any property manager that wanted one.

If Airbnb's permit application gets stuck in red tape, it could still operate in the city, Harriman said. But it wouldn't be able to operate on top of hotel properties or apartment buildings, even if those businesses pay a permit fee to the city to operate as hotels — a status that allows the city to issue licenses to the companies.

Airbnb hasn't formally asked for a permit, and doesn't want it.

"We want to be in business in Portland, even if we must compete with the hotel industry," the company wrote on its Facebook page earlier this month. "We believe Portland is a great city and we'd like to welcome people to stay in our homes and apartments, but we need to do everything we can to provide a safe and legal experience for our community."

A spokesman for Airbnb did not return a call seeking comment.

Harriman said that as Airbnb and Homeaway would be applying for and applying for permits at the same time, the city will need to make sure they don't compete for the same properties.

He said it's clear that there are legitimate business models out there for people who want to rent out entire apartment buildings, but those companies wouldn't qualify in the city's regulations because they are operating in violation of zoning codes.

"The reality is Airbnb is going to have to apply for a lot and wait forever for that permit," Harriman said.

Other cities, like Portland, have used zoning to require certain businesses to get permits. For example, Airbnb must obtain city approval for any move to sell or rent homes in a non-residential district, such as in downtown Portland, or in commercial areas.

According to Harriman, Airbnb had a meeting with Portland officials before the draft regulations were released, talking about potential challenges in acquiring permits, and how long it would take the company to apply.

Since the draft regulations were released, Harriman said his team has been working with Airbnb to figure out how best to make the plan work.

The city is also considering whether to issue a separate license for every individual unit, as San Francisco has done with non-hotels.

The Planning and Sustainability Commission is set to vote on the new proposal Feb. 21. If the ordinance passes, it would go into effect in 120 days.

==================== COMPLETION 227 ====================
 that prohibits vacation rentals in the five boroughs, while other cities have banned owners of hotels and bed-and-breakfasts from renting out rooms on the Web.

In October 2014, Chicago enacted a ban on short-term rentals for a year, setting an even higher ban in 2017, a year after San Francisco followed suit. Two months later, Boston became the first major U.S. city to impose the citywide ordinance.

But Portland is poised to do much, much more, according to mayoral candidate Ted Wheeler.

On Wednesday night, Wheeler unveiled the first of six bills he plans to introduce to the Portland City Council in response to Airbnb, a company that has built its business on building platforms that enable short-term rentals of entire apartment units for thousands of dollars through a variety of different channels.

The proposals range from regulating Airbnb to a blanket ban on its use in residential neighborhoods, Wheeler said.

Among other points, they include:

• Requiring a two-thirds vote to amend city ordinances.

• Setting up an independent commission to write regulations, rather than relying on the city council.

• Raising the maximum rental price to $2,500.

• Establishing a two-year moratorium on regulations related to short-term rentals, though Wheeler said he hoped to see a permanent ban on them before then.

Wheeler is seeking to use the city charter to do what the Obama Justice Department is pushing Congress to do. The city's own ordinance allows the Council to make an ordinance "regulating the use and occupancy of residential short-term rentals for profit." But Wheeler proposed adding his measure to a broader measure that would provide "general laws or general rules, and related policies regulating the use and occupancy of residential short-term rentals."

The issue has been controversial in the city for some time. A November 2014 study found 90 short-term or "rent-a-room" rentals on Airbnb in the Portland area.

That's nearly one for every nine apartments — the kind that wouldn't be required for long-term rentals under regulations being proposed by city officials.

In 2015, the city council passed a more restrictive ordinance restricting short-term rentals in some of the more affluent neighborhoods like Lake Oswego and Clackamas. Critics at the time said that was unfair because those neighborhoods had far fewer homes for short-term rentals.

Now it seems they'll be seeing more of the same.

In April, Oregon joined New York and Portland in filing suit against Airbnb for allegedly not paying lodging taxes, even though the company claims to pay more than $200,000 in taxes annually and is the subject of tax audits with the IRS. The suit calls on the courts to force Airbnb to collect all tax money it owes at the next due date.

Wheeler's proposals wouldn't have much effect on that. But they could signal how he'll approach tax issues as mayor. The city's current ordinance does not have a provision to require Airbnb and similar sites to collect long-term lodging taxes.

Portland has not imposed a tax on Airbnb, according to Mike Kintner, Wheeler's spokesman. It has a 1 percent lodging tax, and that goes only to pay for city services and is not assessed to homeowners. In 2015, Airbnb paid $35,722 to Portland, according to city records.

Wheeler said the city will have to look at whether it "fits in our model or not."

That could include using it to provide incentives for people to buy or rent units or properties, he said.

"It's a way to encourage people that it would be valuable, and so I think the City Council would be very

 that requires short-term rentals that are more than 30 days to pay property taxes, and that landlords post a conspicuous notice on their door letting people know it's OK to park out front.

Portland lawmakers in May put forward a resolution asking for a City Council subcommittee to explore short-term rentals — both short-term stays such as vacation rentals and long-term rentals like short-term leases — that don't generate enough of an impact on city coffers to warrant an official zoning change.

But the resolution didn't get any action when the City Council voted for Council President Barbara Johnson's appointment to the subcommittee instead. In October, Johnson was out of town at the time, but her replacement, Commissioner Nick Fish, said in a February letter to her that he had agreed to take over.

City planners want to find ways to handle short-term rentals, and it has been working with groups that include the Oregon Hotel and Lodging Association, Oregon Real Estate Board, Portland Association of Realtors and the Greater Portland Lodging Industry Coalition to come up with a recommendation it'll send to city commissioners later this year.

Fees and taxes won't be the only issues, though, said Greg LeRoy, executive director of the Greater Portland Lodging Industry Coalition.

"The regulatory framework will be very important," LeRoy said. "We need to define it in a way that is accessible."

City officials aren't giving much away — though LeRoy said he doesn't think the committee will consider a specific definition of what constitutes a short-term rental on Airbnb.

Instead, LeRoy said, city officials will take a long, hard look at the impact short-term rentals are having on their communities and on other business, and come up with regulations that keep the industry honest and ensure it's operating within the law.

In a letter last year, Portland police outlined its concerns about short-term rental activity in a list of concerns:

Homes are taken over at times and for long-term stays.

Homes are rented to people who do not have a place to live.

Homes are rented to people who commit crimes as a result of having a home to sleep in.

Homes are rented to people who break the law by not complying with state and Portland City codes.

Homes are rented to people with behavioral and/or mental health issues.

Homes are rented to families.

Homes are rented out to people who would cause negative impact on others in the neighborhood.

Homes are rented to people who would cause environmental impact.

Some of those same issues apply to Airbnb, though the city has been working to tighten up ordinances for home sharing services in recent years, LeRoy said.

The city has gone after illegal businesses in the past, he said. Portland police have worked with Airbnb to target properties that are selling fake or illegal rentals. The city last year asked Airbnb for information on which hosts are renting to illegal listings and for data on the number and types of short-term rentals they're hosting on the site. Airbnb hasn't provided information yet, but has promised to provide it to officials. Portland police also recently contacted Airbnb for assistance in enforcement action, but LeRoy said it wasn't part of the upcoming Airbnb consultation.

"In many cases, Airbnb is a very helpful and valuable service that is providing housing to people who otherwise couldn't afford housing," LeRoy said.

 workers, but they need to be convinced over and over again. They are also skeptical, on both cultural and economic grounds, of the benefits of immigration, which is seen as endangering the cohesion of the folk community and introducing new, low-wage competition for jobs. Neither result strikes Jacksonian opinion as a suitable outcome for a desirable government policy.

The Indispensable Element

Jacksonian influence in American history has been—and remains—enormous. The United States cannot wage a major international war without Jacksonian support; once engaged, politicians cannot safely end the war except on Jacksonian terms. From the perspective of members of other schools and many foreign observers, when Jacksonian sentiment favors a given course of action, the United States will move too far, too fast and too unilaterally in pursuit of its goals. When Jacksonian sentiment is strongly opposed, the United States will be seen to move too slowly or not at all. For anyone wishing to anticipate the course of American policy, an understanding of the structure of Jacksonian beliefs and values is essential.

It would be an understatement to say that the Jacksonian approach to foreign policy is controversial. It is an approach that has certainly contributed its share to the headaches of American policymakers throughout history. It has
==================== COMPLETION 229 ====================
 also provided a framework within which to consider how to achieve desired ends despite difficult political hurdles. But it has remained a useful framework. Jacksonian ideology has remained relevant on American foreign policy because it enables us to appreciate the difficulties inherent in our approach and to understand how they have been overcome.

To the best of my knowledge, no one has yet produced a general theory of American foreign policy, but I do believe that the main points of view from which many have emerged can be summed up by two broad generalizations that have been broadly accepted and are still relevant to the United States today. Both of these generalizations, I suspect, are false, though they seem reasonable. A true account of US policy on foreign policy would probably start from the understanding that the United States pursues foreign policy because some people want it to, not because it is in the United States' strategic interest to do so.

The first generalization is the belief that American policy is based on a set of ideals that transcend national interest and partisan politics. The second generalization is the belief that American policy is the responsibility of the executive branch and not the legislature. Both assume that the President is entitled to define and carry out US foreign policy. Both assume that the United States may not conduct foreign policy in accordance with national interest. Neither seems likely.

The first assumption is that US foreign policy is based on ideals. The second generalization may be true, but is a fairly recent assumption. For two centuries after the Revolution, our country's foreign policy was the result of intense political debates in Congress, the military, and the people. It has never been a matter of policy-making.

The most important of these debates has been about the nature of the United States, and that will remain so until our country's borders are entirely secured and the last vestiges of the old regime are erased. It is important to remember that the debates that shaped our foreign policy were about ideas, not about policy—they were often intense, passionate, and bitter. The first generalization is true to a certain extent, but this is not surprising given the political climate of the time.

The Jacksonians have often expressed the belief that the nation was born into a free republic, but our political system has remained a constitutional monarchy until the United States was established as a republic—a time period during which we have faced and overcome a series of foreign military conflicts, and when our foreign policy was shaped by the constant threat of foreign conquest.

The American people were not born into a democracy, but neither have the American people been born into a constitutional monarchy. Each of the American systems has been built on ideas and ideals that transcend national interest and partisan politics. In our system, the people are sovereign and the President exercises the ultimate authority. In our system, the US government must be considered the servant of the people, not the master. In our system, it is a fundamental principle of democracy that the government must pursue the common good, not merely the best interests of a segment of the electorate or a faction in power.

Inevitably, the question of how these principles should govern American foreign policy has been among the most difficult issues that have faced our leaders, or at least the best-informed leaders to have existed in the past 150 years. The questions are as follows:

What are the best values that can be inferred from the American Constitution, from the American traditions?

What values need to be brought to bear in the conduct of foreign policy?

How should the interests of the American people be taken into account in determining policy?

How, if at all, should national interest and partisan politics be reconciled in the pursuit of these values?

While these questions have been central to the debate

 workers, but they need to be convinced over and over again. They are also skeptical, on both cultural and economic grounds, of the benefits of immigration, which is seen as endangering the cohesion of the folk community and introducing new, low-wage competition for jobs. Neither result strikes Jacksonian opinion as a suitable outcome for a desirable government policy.

The Indispensable Element

Jacksonian influence in American history has been—and remains—enormous. The United States cannot wage a major international war without Jacksonian support; once engaged, politicians cannot safely end the war except on Jacksonian terms. From the perspective of members of other schools and many foreign observers, when Jacksonian sentiment favors a given course of action, the United States will move too far, too fast and too unilaterally in pursuit of its goals. When Jacksonian sentiment is strongly opposed, the United States will be seen to move too slowly or not at all. For anyone wishing to anticipate the course of American policy, an understanding of the structure of Jacksonian beliefs and values is essential.

It would be an understatement to say that the Jacksonian approach to foreign policy is controversial. It is an approach that has certainly contributed its share to the headaches of American policymakers throughout history. It has
==================== COMPLETION 230 ====================
 created great uncertainty in matters of national security and the nation's ability to govern and respond to domestic political pressures. It has often come in for harsh criticism and sometimes been seen as little more than a thinly veiled defense of the status quo. And it has sometimes been viewed with resentment even in those parts of the country where the Jacksonian ideology has enjoyed the greatest appeal.

Today, in that context, Jacksonian-style foreign policies—such as the American Revolution and the struggle to bring an end to slavery—are still controversial. So too are their descendants—such as the nation's response to the attacks of September 11, 2001. Jacksonian policies may be more controversial today because the world is a less free, more dangerous place than it was two centuries ago. To be sure, there have been some important advances in how the world works. Civil liberties have generally extended throughout the world. In some places, torture has been discontinued, and the rule of law has been established. Yet these achievements have been accompanied by a great deal of violence, war, and strife, which have taken their toll on people everywhere.

So, while Jacksonian foreign policy may be controversial, the results it has produced have been nothing short of spectacular. During the nineteenth century, the United States established a global presence, established institutions to manage the flow of people and information, and developed a vast system of economic and commercial relations based largely on free trade. By the time the twentieth century began, the United States had become the dominant power in the international community, a position it maintained for the better part of a century. The United States has remained an influential national figure in international affairs for the foreseeable future. That position cannot be attributed, in large part, only to Jacksonian principles and values, however. The United States has achieved these results despite the fact that it was always, in one form or another, a Jacksonian democracy.

The Importance of Jacksonian Thinking

Jacksonian thinking and values were both important to America's development as a global power in the nineteenth century. In one sense, America's economic and political success was a natural byproduct of the country's political system, which allowed its government to pursue policies that were in the national interest. The power and stability that came to be associated with the American way of life rested upon the American economic dynamism, the independence of its domestic politics, and those institutions established after the Revolution that enabled the United States to pursue its domestic policy objectives and to maintain a position of independence from its European and Near Eastern allies. Thus, the country could not achieve its economic and political success without the American political system.

Moreover, American political and economic development was a matter of the will to pursue prosperity. "The American way has never been popular, and it can not afford to lose the popular respect in which it is held abroad," Theodore Roosevelt admitted almost two centuries ago. As early as the early 1860s, John Quincy Adams could write that "a national character is largely the legacy of good government, and it can be most effectively nurtured by good government at home." In other words, the political culture of the United States—especially the American way of life—is the result of and a manifestation of good government.

The idea that America's success could be the result of an ideal mix of political and economic resources is not new. But from the perspective of the United States today, these notions are especially important because America is often viewed as a political and economic basket case. The U.S. is a nation with an enormous debt and a budget deficit larger than any American nation in our history. The nation now faces a budget deficit far larger than its total debt for the next 40 years. In fact, as the National Association of State Budget Officers has reported,
======================================== SAMPLE 231 ========================================
 workers, but they need to be convinced over and over again. They are also skeptical, on both cultural and economic grounds, of the benefits of immigration, which is seen as endangering the cohesion of the folk community and introducing new, low-wage competition for jobs. Neither result strikes Jacksonian opinion as a suitable outcome for a desirable government policy.

When Jacksonian sentiment is strongly opposed, the United States will be seen to move too slowly or not at all. For anyone wishing to anticipate the course of American policy, an understanding of the structure of Jacksonian beliefs and values is essential.

It would be an understatement to say that the Jacksonian approach to foreign policy is controversial. It is an approach that has certainly contributed its share to the headaches of American policymakers throughout history. It has
==================== COMPLETION 231 ====================
 been both popular and unpopular throughout its existence, and the arguments for and against the approach have often been intensely personal and sharply divided—even among contemporary scholars who otherwise favor the Jacksonian approach.

However, if one were simply to examine the arguments for and against Jacksonian foreign policy, it would be difficult to determine whether one is for or against the approach of the Jacksonian party in America. Jacksonian supporters have repeatedly emphasized its value in fostering a strong domestic government, as well as its role in bringing about a more peaceful international relations. In addition, they argue that the policy, if pursued properly, serves as a bulwark against European threats of war. Jacksonian critics, on the other hand, have frequently cited Jackson's intervention in Mexico and his defense of the rights of American slaves to freedom in the antebellum South as evidence for his isolationist tendencies. Critics of the Jacksonian approach point out that, as with slavery, the policies pursued by the federal government are not entirely effective—at least relative to the policies pursued by the Jacksonians. Still, they contend, the general thrust of Jacksonian foreign policy is the right one.

At one end of the spectrum is Herbert Butterfield Jackson, who wrote that the U.S. is "a nation that is constantly advancing." If the country is "not the first, not the last to do anything," then Americans "should never cease and must not rest on laurels of accomplishment." Furthermore, we "should not be content" as a nation, but always should strive to be better. Butterfield Jackson was a champion of the New Model Army movement of the mid-19th century. In the words of a later supporter of the Jacksonian approach, the New Model Army "was as much the fulfillment of the wishes of the whole Republican party as was Jackson himself." The movement, based on the belief that an individual could best achieve results by being better armed and more effective than the citizenry at an individual level, offered the nation an opportunity to address some foreign policy challenges faced by the United States in the early years of its existence.

At the other end of the spectrum are many Jacksonians who maintain that the United States should have abandoned its effort to suppress slavery in North America and instead moved on to other goals. In this view, the United States should have instead joined with other European powers during the Crimean War. "The United States should have fought a war to free the slaves in a foreign land," argued one nineteenth-century editor, "rather than allow the slave-holding States to be subjugated and their lands to be taken away." Another wrote that the nation was "going to war with the negro, which it had not done since its inception," and that "our war of independence has been a war between two foreign nations; that we are preparing for a war of conquest with Great Britain, and in the meantime we have not yet begun to take that great step into which the destiny of the entire free world seems to be directed."

The Jacksonians' concern with the foreign policy of the United States is based on two basic ideas. First, the United States is a free nation, and so the interests of the American people should be the primary concern of foreign policy rather than the interests of other nations. Second, the United States should focus its national defense effort as narrowly as possible. If the United States is an independent republic, the nation should concentrate on defense against attacks on its citizens and territory—and nothing else. The goal is not, in other words, to spread the influence of U.S. ideas, but to protect American lives and property.

In this approach, one does not look for foreign assistance or even encouragement; one looks solely for assistance from foreign powers. The United States, in short,

They are also skeptical, on both cultural and economic grounds, of the benefits of immigration, which is seen as endangering the cohesion of the folk community and introducing new, low-wage competition for jobs. Neither result strikes Jacksonian opinion as a suitable outcome for a desirable government policy.

For anyone wishing to anticipate the course of American policy, an understanding of the structure of Jacksonian beliefs and values is essential.

It would be an understatement to say that the Jacksonian approach to foreign policy is controversial. It is an approach that has certainly contributed its share to the headaches of American policymakers throughout history. It has
==================== COMPLETION 232 ====================
 not, however, generated a total consensus, and that remains true even today. While many Jacksonians are not hostile toward the United States, the American people as a whole do not necessarily hold similar views. It is widely acknowledged that, in the general population as well as within the Jacksonian elite, Jacksonian beliefs and values have had a considerable effect on American foreign policy and that there is no simple, consistent way to explain the views of this group.

Jacksonians see themselves as the representatives of the people in America—the nation-state, to use their preferred term. They claim, therefore, that they should have the ultimate authority and say in all matters important to the citizens they serve. They see themselves as a kind of national executive whose job is to implement the will of the people. Jacksonians claim special powers over foreign affairs because they believe that it is their job to implement American interests and values abroad.

Jacksonian political science has a term for this kind of intervention. It is described as interventionism, and Jacksonians have been, and have continued to be, proponents of it. Jacksonian scholars also recognize a kind of interventionism in international relations generally, and that term is also used to refer to the Jacksonian approach to international policy matters. This means that Jacksonians are opposed to the use of military force in international affairs, but they also believe that the world should be governed through institutions and treaties, and by nonviolent methods. Some other Jacksonians take a much more militaristic view, favoring direct military confrontation against countries of dubious human rights standards.

The problem in the United States is that even Jacksonian interventionists may have different goals and different ideas about which means of achieving their goals are worth using. Jacksonian policies may be implemented in one part of the world, while they can be highly unpopular in another, and those in different parts of the world may find their effects incompatible. Jacksonian foreign policy is a mixture of policies based on ideology and ones based on practicality; there are no clear boundaries in between. Although Jacksonians tend to place extreme emphasis on the moral and political value of foreign assistance, many of their views on other matters are extremely complicated and inconsistent.

There is, however, one particular way in which Jacksonian foreign policy has operated with some consistency throughout the decades since Jackson's time. This is the use of military force. In 1823 Jackson's friend James Madison, the father of the Constitution, wrote of the use of military force, a topic that the Jacksonians often addressed in their writings. Madison stressed that governments should not use "a blunt instrument, without a fair argument, a mere blunt instrument, unless the end or object is to inflict an injury." As he explained, "It cannot be pretended that war or a declaration of war could ever be justified or justifiable. … War, being in its nature, an injury, ought not therefore to be exercised, but under the penalty of war."

The United States did not become the world's most powerful nation in the 19th century, nor has it ever been able to use military force effectively to its own benefit. As Jacksonian scholar Richard Hofstadter put it, "[t]here is in the world no military force that seems likely to be able to achieve the sort of success that, at least for some time to come, the United States wants to enjoy." But this fact would not have prevented Jackson from continuing to rely on armed force as a tool of statecraft, or for other Americans from recognizing the wisdom of that use of force and from relying on it to secure their interests.

The Red House

Formerly known as Hornton Villa. Demolished

This house was built by Stephen Bird for his own occupation. He moved in during 1835 and in the following year was granted a lease by Charles Phillimore for ninety-nine years from 1828; (fn. 131) he called the house Hornton Villa. Bird was one of the most notable builders and brickmakers of Kensington. He owned a sixteen-acre brick-field to the west of the Potteries and in 1836 gave evidence to the Commissioners of Excise Inquiry as one of the eminent brickmakers in the neighbourhood of London. (fn. 132) In 1861, when he was eighty years old, his brickmaking business was still flourishing and employed nearly one hundred hands. (fn. 60) At this time he also described himself as a farmer with about forty acres of land. For several years he conducted his building operations in partnership with his son Henry and extended his activities to other areas of London besides Kensington. (fn. 13) In 1838–9 he secured the contract for constructing the new covered part of the Counter's Creek sewer made necessary by the building of the
==================== COMPLETION 233 ====================
 West Kensington road. In 1844, he constructed a small house near his brickyard with ten feet of his own building and used the same brickwork for this purpose as that employed at the top of the present house. (fn. 133)

He died in 1865 and in his will his sons and daughter received £100 in two equal sections, one of which, valued at £90, was paid after his death at the rate of 15 shillings a year. (fn. 134) The other was held by his daughter Sarah for her own use and the payment to her was deemed a proper provision for the support of her husband. (fn. 135)

The present house was built between 1868 and 1870 and was owned until 1902 by his son Robert. (fn. 136) He erected the structure and undertook its completion in his native village of West Malling, a year later than his father had wished due to technical difficulties. (fn. 137) He used in his own house a style of construction not very widely used in London except for the upper floors. (fn. 138)

A house of this type was formerly occupied by Mr Frederick Linton in No. 7 Balfour Street, which, as has been told, had been occupied by his father when he was a boy. The present house was built a little further away. (fn. 139) It was destroyed by the fire that destroyed part of Kensington Hall, but was rebuilt by Mr Edward Linton in 1889–90 on a site originally occupied by a house of that description. (fn. 140) The house was purchased separately from the site and was fitted for the use of the Linton family. It was originally painted blue, but was painted in the same lime green colour on the exterior as was now the style of the house. It contains a large drawing room, and a gallery with portico and gallery. A room is left vacant in the house of Mr Linton. (fn. 141)

In the present house are a dining-room, bedroom, kitchen, dressing room, cellar, hall and a garden. The former master-apprentice was Mr H. H. P. Drennan, (fn. 142) who worked there from 1854 to 1855. Mr H. H. P. Drennan had for many years been the landlord of the building and died in 1869, leaving two tenants, Mr Charles Hill and Mr Edward Taylor. They bought the house on the completion of its purchase in 1890 and occupied it from then until the present day, when it was sold by Mr Taylor in 1904, to Mr Robert Linton. It was described as an 'old house' as though it had been well-used before the recent building of it, but on enquiry could find none on its land. It had been a large and well-to-do house in the late 1820s, and for many years the front of it was occupied as a storeroom, the rear being used as a stable. (fn. 143)

Balfour Street

Formerly known as Redland Court. Demolished

The former Redland Court had for many years been a very large house of three storeys, with a cellar or stable, which was bought by Mr John Henry Chalkley in 1870 on a temporary basis, and afterwards kept by him as a hotel until his death in 1893. (fn. 144) It had for a long period been occupied as the headquarters of the Royal Navy's merchant marine in England. The present owner bought it from Mr Chalkley and was obliged to demolish it because of the building of the new West Kensington and Westbourne Gardens. But when at last the house was removed to its

(fn. 13) In 1838–9 he secured the contract for constructing the new covered part of the Counter's Creek sewer made necessary by the building of the
==================== COMPLETION 234 ====================
 Kensington railway. In 1852 he erected a new house on a part of the new premises and sold it to George Stillington. It was this house that Burne-Jones had intended as the residence of the Commissioners of Excise, but he had his doubts about its fitness for this purpose. (fn. 133) The house was sold to Mr. William and Mary Coote and in 1855 Burne-Jones moved his establishment to the house of Mr. and Mrs. William A. Hays.

The Cootes House

On the other side of the new railway line the house of William and Mary Coote (now known as the Cootes House) was the scene of an interesting dispute. The house had been built in 1846 and had been occupied by John Cootes until his death in the year 1859. Mrs. Cootes, the eldest daughter of the deceased, lived in another house at Kensington. (fn. 84) The old house was much demolished by her husband in 1860–1, (fn. 134) but her surviving son William, who by a previous marriage had been entitled to the lease from Stephen Bird's house, (fn. 13) made a new claim for building his own house of brick or stone and occupying it as one with the right of sale to the public. This was approved by The Mayor and the Council of London. Then, in 1872, the lease from Stephen Bird's house was revoked, although the house remained as it was at the time of the dispute. It was then bought over by a contractor who built a house of the same type as that of Stephen Bird's, (fn. 135) the building having been intended for his use. Mrs. Cootes, who took a special interest in bringing about the termination of the dispute, was also entitled to a share in the property. (fn. 136) In 1884–5 the first of their six children succeeded to their lease and in 1882 a new lease was granted to the family. (fn. 137)

The Cootes family had no children, (fn. 138) and the house was left to the care of Charles and Fanny Stillington, who took the place in 1861 of Lady Coote. (fn. 139) Mrs. Stillington had no previous connection with the house and had never resided there. (fn. 140) The family had no relatives to whom they could claim the rents for the house, but in 1860 a certain Charles Fowell took charge of the rents due to the family. (fn. 141)

John Cootes sold the land on which the house stood to Edward Green (1840–1), who in 1872 purchased as an estate to the tenant John Stillington a twenty-three-acre tract of land in a wood of the Cross Road, (fn. 142) and in 1887 took title to the property as a dwelling house in addition to his adjoining house, on these two property lines. (fn. 143) (fn. 14) His name was not recorded on the deeds of the land until May 5, 1892. (fn. 144) In 1868 the house was inhabited by the widower Henry Cootes who married Miss Mary Coote, born about 1812, who in 1880 took charge and continued in charge until her death in 1895. (fn. 15) In 1888—this being the second year of occupation—a dispute arose between John Stillington and Henry Cootes which resulted in the eviction of Mr. Stillington and his wife. (fn. 146) (fn. 146) A year later Henry Cootes transferred the house to his wife, which was again occupied

The Town Hall

Built in 1820–1, on a site which previously abounded in green-houses and gardens, and which stood on what has become known as the "Red House Corner", was built and occupied by the Council from February 1822 (fn. 133) to February 1826, after the dissolution of the previous Council. It was used as a council office until, after the establishment of the Kensington Hall in October 1825, it was used to house and care for the new Town Hall.

The Old Dock House

The house on the south side of the Old Bank of the Thames is known as the Old Dock House. From the earliest stage of development its role was mainly administrative: there was never any prospect of its becoming an active house of accommodation. This, however, changed in 1826.

The Old Dock House, with a capacity of 150 inhabitants, was given to the new Council, who installed for it the work of architects Richard and Richard Pott, assisted by Benjamin Smith, while the property was sold, and the land conveyed, to the Town Company in 1824. The purchase price of £150, plus 5% tax was made to the Crown. This raised only £80 and, after interest payable of 3 years, the debt was eventually cancelled in 1834. (fn. 136) The house survived the reorganisation of London as a corporation and the rebuilding of many of the roads which later became the thoroughfares of the city. (fn. 137) The house in Kensington however was demolished in 1840, together with the old Bank, on the site of this old dock house, and the land was taken up in the public domain. (fn. 138) The present building was built under the same ownership until 1883, when it was sold to one Richard Emslie. It became the residence of Sir Henry Fennell at that time. Since that time it has been used as "The Fennells' House" and now houses the museum of London.

The Fennells' House

Henry and Ellen Fennell were of an old, wealthy Kentish Protestant family. They came to London in 1805 and bought the famous farm of Parnell, about one hundred miles from London; the Fennells, however, were to become the most distinguished and wealthy of all London landowners. He was a banker, his wife and daughter were wealthy merchants, and their sons were prominent bankers of various nationalities. The Fennells had a house on the banks of the Thames; and Henry, the eldest, a noted painter.

The house at Red Lion Street that they sold to the town was a Georgian house that the Fennells had built in the middle of the 16th century. The present Fennells' house, at the corner of Red Lion Street and Red Lion Square, is in all respects very similar to the original. Though it was rebuilt about the year 1830, the house in Kensington remains in its original state.

The Old Town Hall

On 12 June 1821 the Town Government was dissolved. The Council, headed by the Mayor of London, was dissolved on 12 June 1822 and the Borough of Kensington-on-the-Wold was created, along with the borough of Ealing (which was itself re-named Ealing Council), taking the name from the Ealing Hospital, which the new Borough was to incorporate. In 1824 Ealing Council also took over ownership of the Council House which originally had belonged to London Corporation. The Town Council continued in office until 2 December 1850, when it was dissolved for want of funds by the London

 new Stokes Croft sewer. (fn. 135) However, in 1845 the brickwork was not installed and a number of houses and shops were demolished. (fn. 136) In 1847 he made a further lease with Charles Phillimore for ninety-nine years at 2,500 acres to enable the developer to erect buildings on the estate with which to pay the costs of the road. (fn. 137) After the completion of this new sewage work, (fn. 138) Bird continued to run his business successfully, building a number of buildings in the suburbs of the City of London and in South Kensington.

The red brick structure built on a small flat was demolished in 1870 (fn. 139).

The Red House in Kensington is not the only home in the City to have been used as a prison. (fn. 140) Two other places appear to have been used as prisons, and both had red brick walls on the side facing the street.

The most important site in the City to have been used by the City prison was the Red House near Blackfriars Bridge. (fn. 141) This prison was built in 1660 by Charles Lely in the Blackfriars area of London; (fn. 142) the name of Lely is from the Old English lei, meaning 'high place'. The Red House was made of brick and was at one time the home of Lord Lely. It is said he enjoyed considerable wealth and a number of his contemporaries were of his social standing, for instance Thomas Wriothesley. When Lely was prosecuted for treason it was said to have been Lely who defended him; hence, Lord Lely was a close friend of Oliver Cromwell and he was present at his execution. (fn. 15) During the reign of Charles II and especially during the reign of Charles I, Lely had been imprisoned because he refused the King's entreaties for his support against William the Conqueror from the City of London. In the early 18th century it seems that Lely's property, the Red House, was occupied by a number of persons of quality and he was a wealthy man, (fn. 143) to a high degree. (fn. 144)

The first prisoner that was transported from the Red House was William Bewes, a wealthy Londoner of the 1740s who died in prison. (fn. 145)

Two other examples of prisons which were used in the Red House are known from local records. In 1771 a woman called Ann Leitch was imprisoned in the Red House for her part in an attempt to murder the Mayor of Great Britain at the Parliament House in London two years earlier. (fn. 146) The Red House was used again as a prison in 1815. A woman called Caroline Dutchie, aged nineteen, and who had been living on the Red House, with her husband, died after a struggle with the Sheriff in the Red House on the 27 th April, 1815. (fn. 147) Dutchie is known to have been a prostitute, and the Sheriff was of the opinion that she had been treated worse than the other women confined in the Red House. (fn. 148)

In 1819 the City of London was invaded on three successive days. On Tuesday 16th August 1819 a number of women and children were confined in the Red House near the Old Bailey. (fn. 149) On 23rd August another woman, Alice Staunton, died of pneumonia in the Redhouse. (fn. 150) On the 27 th January, 1820 twenty more women arrived in the Red House from the Redhouse. (fn. 151) In 1822 a number of young girls from the Blackf

In the last few days, three of the Trump administration's top priorities have been met.

The Trump administration is finally going to enforce the law against domestic violence, women shouldn't be allowed to choose their own doctors and Medicaid is finally coming under the federal microscope.

The Department of Health and Human Services announced this week that it is revising its rules for how Medicaid is funded to prevent waste, fraud and abuse. The Department of Labor announced it's revising its rules for how employers are required to pay workers for working on the clock. And the Trump administration is finally taking steps to address the growing backlog of women in prison, some of which were wrongly sent there as child soldiers or as sex trafficking victims.

All of these promises are part of a larger plan by President Donald Trump to fundamentally change the U.S. approach to women's health care and to help the U.S. economy grow by expanding employment opportunities for women and their families.

The Department of Labor:

On Tuesday, the White House formally withdrew an Obama-era policy that mandated equal pay for men and women. It's been a long time coming and the White House had to go through three administrations to even begin the debate.

However, even in its place, the policy will now be implemented by the Labor Department, a more independent agency that isn't directly tied to the White House. The agency told NPR at the time that it was confident that it would continue to promote gender equality, noting that it was implementing the policy as part of its efforts to make sure more women are included in the workforce and that it would not be a cost to the taxpayer.

"We're not going to put any women in jail," Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta told NPR when asked about the withdrawal from the Obama-era policy. "We think it's right that we have women in the workforce."

The Obama-era policy "tried to create an environment that discouraged employers from discriminating, but at the same time allowed employers to use their discretion," according to Acosta. "It was something that we think will make it easier to include women in the workforce."

The Labor Department has made changes since 2009 to the Equal Pay Act, and some employers complain that they were unfairly blamed for discrimination under the law's previous version.

The announcement comes despite a 2015 Congressional budget office report stating the government would save $56.6 million per year by eliminating the Equal Pay Act's requirement on companies to disclose gender-based wage data.

While it may be disappointing to see the Obama-era policy being rolled back, it's not surprising. The Trump administration has had the opportunity to do much of what it promised on women's issues — in particular, to rein in the Department of Health and Human Services' policies on how hospitals provide emergency contraception to sexually active women and to ensure the Affordable Care Act is not used to fund the abortion industry.

July 25, 2011: The Florida House of Representatives unanimously ratified HB 119<|endoftext|>On Nov. 15, 2015, two young people set an apartment's fire with a homemade incendiary device. While the apartment building's residents escaped, the perpetrator, who was apprehended less than an hour later, had killed his mother and injured his stepmother. The perpetrators are suspected to be a gay male and a trans female and may face murder charges because they are suspected of "homicide based on hate crime," according to an Associated Press story.

If you are under 30 and not lesbian or gay, or if you are a white Christian and not a gay male or trans person of color, you may have already heard the stories circulating among your friends. This is not a new occurrence.

"We've been hearing this story a lot lately but not always together," Emily E. Maritz, an associate in the LGBT & AIDS Law Project at the Center for American Progress, wrote in an email.

This is not the first time lesbians and bisexual women have been threatened with murder based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.

The first known recorded case of a lesbian woman being killed for her sexual orientation occurred in 1973 and involved an elderly woman named Eunice Koonz. The Washington State Department of Corrections is holding her records hostage because it believes she needs to die.

Koonz was arrested after fleeing the scene of an alleged rape in 1971. She was convicted of "criminal sexual penetration" and was sentenced to two years in state prison and six years in juvenile detention. In 1978, Koonz was convicted by a Los Angeles jury of first-degree murder for the murder of Mary Jo White, a 53-year-old transgender woman. She was given two life sentences for the crime. After her conviction, Koonz petitioned the California Supreme Court for clemency and said she was a woman trapped in a man's body. A California judge denied her appeal the following year. Koonz died in prison in 2009 at age 85.

Koonz is not the only woman ever put to death under such circumstances.

According to The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), a lesbian and gay organization, between 1974 and 1981, a trans man named Larry Boyer was also sentenced to two life sentences for killing a woman. He too died in prison at the age of 78.

Boyer was sentenced by Superior Court Judge John Fetter, who had been previously convicted of statutory rape as an officer in the Oregon National Guard. He was sentenced to life in prison and 10,000 lashes for abusing two lesbians in an Oregon motel. Boyer became homosexual as a teenager. A year later, he and two other male soldiers from the Oregon National Guard took their vows of military celibacy. The others were court-martialed in November 1967 and were sentenced to death.

The Oregon Department of Corrections claimed that Boyer was murdered because of his sexual orientation. However,

October 31, 2010: Florida Insurance Administrator Files Request for Review of PIP Mandate<|endoftext|>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — U.S. Rep. John Conyers has stepped aside amid allegations from former staff members that he sexually harassed them.

Three former staff members told BuzzFeed late last week that Conyers, who has been in Congress for more than half a century, made inappropriate sexual advances toward them and used his influence to secure trips and other gifts for members of his office. The three were not identified by their names because they fear retaliation.

House Democratic leaders had previously called for Conyers to resign.

This past weekend, however, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said "no" when asked if Conyers should stay in office.

Pelosi said Tuesday that the party believes the women's account and has urged the Ethics Committee to investigate the allegations against Conyers.

In a statement, Pelosi said she called Conyers to inform him of the latest allegations and offer her deepest sympathies. In calling him to give him the news, Pelosi said, "I said I am praying for him, and asked God to give him the grace and courage to address these serious charges fully."

The statement goes on to say that Conyers will remain a member of the House and will focus on his duties and his constituents.

The allegations first surfaced late last week through the website Medium, which has been reporting on the widening sexual harassment investigations underway in Hollywood.

The alleged incidents date to at least the 1980s. One former staffer detailed in the BuzzFeed report alleged that Conyers, who also served in the House from 1964 to 1966, "suggested that he needed a sexual favor" from another staffer in exchange for keeping quiet.

Another staffer, who was between jobs, wrote that Conyers said it was "OK" for him to ask her to meet a longtime female friend.

Former staffers who spoke anonymously said Conyers would often check in with young staffers about their personal lives, and he would pick up the phone and hang up when staffers declined his invitations.

He would ask them for free hotel rooms and then use their personal and professional relationships for his gain, they wrote in the BuzzFeed report.

Former members of Conyers' staff have since come forward to deny the new accusations.

In an earlier statement, Conyers denied the claims. His attorney Arnold Reed said Conyers settled one case, but it wasn't because of the new allegations.

"The former staff member made claims in an attempt to extort money from Mr. Conyers," Reed told WXYZ-TV in Detroit. "While the case was pending, Mr. Conyers paid the accuser $27,000."

In previous statement last year, Conyers said he had settled a complaint in 1997, but the matter was not reported at the time, according to the Detroit Free Press.

The Detroit News reported last week that another former staffer shared a similar story but didn't want to be identified for fear of retaliation from Conyers' office

Both Mackey and Saffell noted that although most of the Basin Roundtables recognize the economic value of healthy rivers, far fewer have actually quantified those benefits - or included specific language to protect stream flows. Since each Basin's recommendations lay the foundation for the statewide plan, it's essential that all of them include concrete standards.

But the river advocates are up against some strong, well-entrenched political forces. They pointed to the big agriculture and municipal interests that drive a large chunk of Colorado's economy – and hold much of the power at the Basin Roundtables.

In comparison, the recreation economy is "the new kid on the block,", says Mackey, who grew up skiing on wood skis and cable bindings. "I'm a sixty year old man and Patagonia, The North Face, the Vail Ski Resort – these companies grew up in my lifetime," he added. "So we really need to push our way into the conversation."

And there's another challenge: Colorado's water laws. Most were written in the late 1800's and though a few modifications have occurred over the years, the laws still reinforce a "use it or lose it" mentality, which makes it difficult to implement conservation strategies

 on a sustained basis.

Mason Tvert, senior staff attorney with the Center for Western Priorities, said he thinks the current system is working just fine.

"The Colorado River Basin is not a failed river; it's working just fine with a large economy, vibrant recreation economy, and the support of the government and the Colorado Water Conservation Board," Tvert said. "But I can't believe we would leave the state with what we have now," he added, explaining that Colorado's water rules are not designed to meet the long-term sustainability goal of maintaining water quality within a few miles of the Colorado River.

The Center for Western Priorities has released a report that highlights the ways in which Colorado's laws are leaving the state's rivers in serious danger. In 2015, the state's water management laws were in dire need of an overhaul, according to the CWWP. That year alone, Colorado received more than $1.4 billion in annual monies in allocation from Colorado's state, tribal, and federal governments.

But since most of the monies are spent locally on the development of projects in the basin, it's not always going to benefit the people who live along the river's shoreline.

"The federal government is the only entity at the federal level that has any say over how the water is used," Mackey says. "So for example, the federal government doesn't tell them how a dam is developed, or that it uses a lot of water downstream."

The Colorado River Compact, which is currently being finalized this fall, stipulates that if the basin's governing bodies fail to meet their sustainability targets, the water will be diverted to other states or put into the Lake Powell reservoir, with the proceeds going towards replenishing the Colorado River Basin Basin's reservoirs. But, Mackey says, this agreement will be more effective if every member of the commission makes it clear that such programs will be contingent upon the state's progress in achieving a sustainable River Standard – and it needs to include concrete guidelines and language.

Mackey says the commission will get new powers to oversee the basin's water management once they've finalized the Compact, but says he doesn't believe those improvements will have any serious impact without the legal framework.

But, Mackey says, his group has learned a valuable lesson: "It's not about going to the next administration and telling 'em we've got to do it another way," he says. "I think we're going to have to bring all these issues to the table and tell people that it's very expensive to get into the Colorado River."

What Colorado needs to do, Tvert says, is create a framework that will allow the basin's various governing bodies to meet the sustainability rules and ensure that local watersheds are protected, not just for today, but for the future.

"It's important as a community or state to put resources toward that because it's more important than the money," Tvert says.<|endoftext|>On Wednesday, we brought you the first look at a new teaser image from "Justice League" No. 1, and now we're premiering a fresh one and talking to a couple stars about the film.

 that have long-term value.

"The laws are very hard to change," says Saffell, referring to the Colorado Water Conservation Code.

"The problem in the state has always been the lack of public awareness," she adds. "Our public policy and our legislators are really afraid of looking at this issue in a different way."

The problem with these laws, of course, isn't that they restrict the Colorado River's flow (though they often do that as well through various restrictions and the addition of dams to create water storage). The problem is the laws are often written in a way that favors the water industries that support them.

For example, the codes include a lot of language that allows states to charge an "adoption fee" to use the Colorado River "at its natural flow." Colorado's current law caps the "adoption fee" – usually around $150; some water agencies are now raising or raising the fee to up to $175 to help offset the cost of maintaining the dams on the Colorado River.

There are a few ways to make the laws more environmental friendly, says David Shaff of the Sierra Club's western regional affiliate. If the law's language "was updated to look more like what's in our own local community's code, we would get a lot of people interested. Also, there have to be more language requirements on states – if the only thing on the law is, 'Don't release, don't release'" – then there's no way to enforce.

"Our state law is really designed to create revenue for certain businesses and industries that depend on this river. There was already a lot in place when we passed them all back in the 1950s."

Shaff has worked with state governments over the past decade, lobbying for more language in the code, or for the adoption of bills requiring conservation efforts as part of an overall water efficiency plan. When Colorado passed more stringent water use laws around the same time, he saw an increase in the adoption fee.

While the new water laws have spurred more awareness of the Colorado River and the need to protect it, they still leave a lot to be done. As Mackey notes, conservation efforts at the state level aren't being accompanied by other state regulations that can be more powerful – such as regulations that protect against dams being built on rivers in a state that doesn't already have the dams in place.

"So we have to do it ourselves," he explains.

When a new roundtable occurs every three years, Colorado's water conservation groups are pushing for a stronger commitment to water conservation during the "conservation season" when companies are preparing to resume their use of the Colorado River.

"We see this as a golden opportunity for our citizens to really step up and say we care about our water and we will hold our government and government agencies to it," says Saffell.

As the political climate continues to change, Colorado will have new opportunities throughout the next few years to create a more sustainable future. There's reason to hope for better.

The question, though, is whether they'll be able to accomplish it.

"The problem has always been the political will behind it," says John T. Abatzoglou, a Colorado State University Extension ecologist and manager of an award-winning water conservation program. Abatzoglou pointed to Colorado's recent changes in the laws that allow municipalities and farmers to voluntarily cut water use.

"But until someone steps up to the plate to push things along, there's really not any incentive to do anything," he says.

The Colorado Basin recommendations will have a profound effect on water use for communities throughout the state. Most communities use 70 percent or more of their water - and the changes to the Basin Roundtable's recommendations could shift that number closer to 100 percent, making a huge impact.

"When that happens you're going to see a lot more people turning on their fireplaces and their sprinklers and using more water," says T.E. Smith, CEO of Boulder's Community Water Center. Smith estimates that the community center could be forced to save $12 million every year by 2030 if its water-saving strategies are implemented, which he says is unprecedented for a community of this size.

Many other cities, including Denver, can also expect to get a boost from the plan, according to Smith.

"With our population we're going to probably see a huge change – we may see it double or triple," says Smith.

The new recommendations are expected to be in place by May – the first few rounds could be completed within weeks.<|endoftext|>When the government is trying to get its message across by using television ads, it's not just interested in reaching voters in the media's key markets, but also in the ones outside major media markets.

So when the government tried to advertise on TV last week, it went big: A 70-second ad featuring Justin Trudeau and five senior members of his cabinet launched simultaneously last Wednesday through two channels: TV and broadcast.

Story continues below advertisement

What's the story?

Ahead of the campaign, the ad appeared on CTV and two other channels. The idea was that if people watched the ad across the country, they would form a cohesive Canadian nation, ready to vote.

The message was a subtle one: In the wake of the attack in Syria, Canadians have to stand up to the world. But the message that got the most traction was the one that highlighted Trudeau and his minister-heroines, including his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau.

What was the message?

As with most government ads, the point was to highlight the accomplishments of the Liberals so far without trying to sell them. But to do so, it needed to put Trudeau in the spotlight, to give him a face and make a person of him. The ad didn't do that, so it tried.

"Justin Trudeau: He's a man for all seasons," was the tagline, and the ad was meant to highlight the Trudeau the government was proud to say it had already worked to achieve. It was all too apparent that the ad failed to put Trudeau in the best light it could.

For instance, the ad ran during primetime on a Saturday afternoon. There wasn't a single shot in the ad when he was talking, instead focusing on other faces in the room – and no one else who is known for talking very much. In the end, Canadians had to watch the ad three times in two days in order to get a sense of just who was in the room.

On the one hand, maybe the ad missed the mark. It doesn't appear to have made a huge impact on the voting public outside major hubs, and it probably didn't help

"The president's executive order is lawless. It runs counter to the principles of America's founding, contradicts law, and does nothing to protect our national security," the Times's editorial board writes.

President Trump's ban is "not a way to address a concrete problem," the Times's editorial board writes.

"Rather, as a matter of public safety and national security, it is cruel and unlawful. It flies in the face of federal law, a presidential proclamation, and a vast majority of American leaders over centuries of both good intentions and bad decisions."

President Trump is also doing "an end run around Congress," the editorial board writes, adding the government should not have the ability to make "lawless" determinations to suspend visas.

The Times's editorial board goes on to call the order "unworkable" which is ironic as Trump has said he wants to make the country "great again" and this order is a result of "unchecked federal power."

The board claims that the federal government's "inappropriate intrusion" into states' sovereignty "is both cruel and unlawful."

"It is cruel for our children to grow up in a country with no recourse," they add, "and lawful because it is the law of the land."

The Times's editorial board then goes on to defend the "rule of law" and its "most basic liberties."

"Understand that a lawless president cannot lawfully execute the laws on their behalf, and that he also cannot lawfully deny American citizens any right to which we have a constitutional duty, including the right to live here with dignity," the editorial board writes.<|endoftext|>Rugby has had some amazing players at the elite level over the last five years but one man whose rise to stardom has been more remarkable than anyone else is the South Sydney Rabbitohs skipper John Sutton. He made his debut at the age of 17 and now leads an unprecedented list of NRL players who played their first games at the age of 16 or under.

There are some incredible stories at the Rabbitohs but the most remarkable is the fact Iain Henderson played all of 22 NRL matches for the Warriors in 2006 while on trial with the Rabbitohs. It wasn't until later when Henderson signed on at Canterbury that he was fully aware he had the distinction of being the first 16-year old to ever play for the Rabbitohs.

That is why we encourage and share the science-based conversation about the effects of climate change with the communities we serve. In 2018 we will build on those efforts.

Climate Solutions, a community-based organization, is developing a new online platform to allow people from across the region to submit their experiences and concerns on how climate change may affect them. We are developing a platform that will allow communities to submit what they have seen, heard, experienced, or experienced, including the ways that climate change affects their lives.

In June 2017 the American Geophysical Union and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) adopted standards, called the National Climate Assessment, that call for regular updates of climate related information and data as the world continues to adjust to climate change. Climate Solutions is committed to providing data on local impacts of climate change to the general public. By engaging the communities our service serves we can help ensure the public is prepared and informed.

How Climate Solutions Works

Our mission is to amplify the science-based story about climate change. We want people to have access to that story, and we think that by partnering with our peers in environmental organizations that can help, we can do that.

It shows that the driver, an adult, was following traffic laws, the News said.

The free center, which is expected to open in June, is the latest twist in a strange-bedfellow development between a Christian charity that raises and distributes medical equipment on a national scale and a Christian group that's trying to raise money for a health center — which they're going to help build.

The two groups haven't always seen eye-to-eye, though both are members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISCK), a U.S. group that traces its roots to a 1950s movement by India's Madras society.

Wolves vs Pacers

Friday night was a special one for Budinger; he came off the bench to score a season-high 18 points on 4-of-6 shooting in addition to going9-of-10 from the free-throw line. In the Wolves' first five games of the season, five different players have led the team in scoring—speaking to just how much everyone on the roster is stepping up despite mounting injuries.

"This is what we expected," Derrick Williams said. "We knew that with Love going down and Ricky out, of course JJ [Barea], too, more guys have to step up. We have a lot of guys that can play, and I think we are showing that right now."

The battle between the two teams was close in the first half, as the lead changed eight times. Minnesota went into halftime up by a single point, and began to
==================== COMPLETION 253 ====================
 chip away at the Pacers' lead in the second half.

"It was a good game for Ricky to get some confidence back," said Budinger. "He's playing well and has confidence. It's very important to have that. He has a lot of big-league talent, and it's important for him to know that he doesn't have to get that much of that confidence. It was great for him. It was important that he showed some confidence in himself."

After trailing by as many as six points, including the final 3:13, the Wolves were within two points on two occasions—an offensive turnover and a Westbrook free-throw attempt, each of which went in for the Pacers. After those chances, though, the momentum shifted.

After taking a 99-99 lead with 1:27 remaining in the second quarter, the Wolves started playing in the flow of what they were feeling—with Love and Wiggins leading the charge. Following a Thompson field goal and Westbrook pull-up jumper, the Wolves were up 75-71 on a three-pointer from Rubio with 39 seconds remaining. A Westbrook putback put the ball back the other way, to a much larger crowd, as the Wolves were once again up by double digits with 28 seconds to go.

After another Westbrook miss, the lead changed again—and this time, in the other direction. Wiggins answered with a putback basket—setting the stage for the perfect lead change.

After another Westbrook bucket, Wiggins was given another chance, as he stole the ball on the other end and put the ball in Rubio's hands.

He then threw the ball away to the Thunder bench. This time it was Westbrook who snatched it up and passed it to Wiggins, who caught it in the post and hit a three-pointer over David West for his second two-point play of the night. A Westbrook basket gave the Wolves the lead for good.

Westbrook didn't make it easy on himself, though. In the final seconds of the game, after a Wolves timeout, Westbrook was fouled by Williams—who hit both free throws to give the Wolves a three-point lead with one second left.

"I definitely had my doubts about whether or not I could make both those free throws, so I'm extremely grateful to David that I did," he said.<|endoftext|>Sprint is making it all too clear that its network is falling short of the needs of business customers who have no alternative to AT&T or Verizon, and has even been charging them exorbitant fees to be in the same footprint as Sprint. Now, Sprint's parent company SoftBank is telling more people that they can still move to Verizon or AT&T.

In a letter to customers who have moved to another service provider and want to keep their accounts, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son says Sprint has "never been less relevant" to customers than it is.

"There is no longer a need to buy a smartphone that you would need if you had not joined Sprint," Son wrote Tuesday to those people. And while Son may not want to be that person for long, he's certainly not the most convincing.

But there are still plenty of people out there who are confused by Son's letter. Sprint recently announced that the iPhone 6S has a better network than the 6 or the 6 Plus, and it will offer iPhones starting at $16 a month when it launches next week for customers who moved from another carrier.

Sprint didn't provide details about the new carrier it plans to launch, but Apple CEO Tim Cook said last week that Sprint will become a "better carrier."

The battle between the two teams was close in the first half, as the lead changed eight times. Minnesota went into halftime up by a single point, and began to
==================== COMPLETION 254 ====================
 pull away in the third quarter. The Pacers' lead shrunk back down to four at the half.

Despite Minnesota shooting just 42.5 percent of the time in the third quarter, the Wolves pulled their offense together and put together a 16-2 run to close out the quarter with a lead of three. The run began with an alley-oop from Wiggins and got more creative as the game progressed. One of the more impressive plays in this third quarter came as the Wolves were getting down to the Minnesota basket.

Wiggins took the ball down to the bucket with the other four Wiggins on the floor. With his teammates crowded around him, he took off and dribbled down the court just like he did last year against the Raptors in the All-Star game. As Wiggins neared the paint, he turned back and fired a cross-court pass to Barea for a big three for an 82-76 Wolves lead with 6:37 left in the period.

Wiggins capped off his hot streak by banking in an open three-pointer over David West with 2:17 left to seal the contest for Minnesota.

The biggest lead the Wolves could find was three three-pointers in one game, but the Pacers managed to take advantage of a team that seems to be getting worse with each game. The game ended with the game tied at 75 with 3:30 to play.

The second half was a mixed bag for the Wolves. They scored just 30 points on 18–29 shooting to fall short in a nail-biting affair. In two second halves against Indiana, Budinger had a game high nine rebounds. The team struggled to generate offense on both offensive and defensive possessions in this contest, leading to a very disappointing finish.

As mentioned above, the Wolves took the lead in the first quarter with a lay-up from Williams. In the second quarter, the game was a bit closer, but the Pacers still had a slight edge. In the second half, the Wolves shot 35 percent from the field as the Pacers were able to maintain their lead at 91–91.

Game notes:

Wiggins finished with 21 points on 7-of-19 shooting and six rebounds; he entered the game averaging 30.4 points on 44–83 (46.5%) shooting in the first two weeks.

The Wolves shot just 35 percent from three-point range with three missed attempts. That mark was the second-least made three-pointer in NBA history, following the record-less 62 points made by Mike Miller this season.

As a team, the Timberwolves shot 44.5 percent from the field. This is the first time in franchise history that Minnesota has shot under 40 percent on three-pointers.

Wiggins is the first player to record a double-double in back-to-back games since Reggie Miller did so in 1993; it was the sixth time a Wolves player did so. The team record is nine held by Kevin Garnett from April 26, 2003 – November 10, 2004.

Garnett had five triple-doubles this season; he was the only player in the NBA with five in four separate seasons this season.

The battle between the two teams was close in the first half, as the lead changed eight times. Minnesota went into halftime up by a single point, and began to
==================== COMPLETION 255 ====================
 pull away in the second quarter, closing the gap to five midway through the third quarter. Still, the win was never in doubt, as it helped the team finish its first 10 games on the right note.

It was a game that would have a significant effect on Wiggins' future.

As the third quarter wound down, he was a man on a mission.

"The fourth quarter, as you can see, he's on fire," said Wolves head coach Rick Adelman. "He's making free throws, he's shooting the rock, he's creating. If he continues to play that way, I feel confident that I can keep him around."

You could see it through his face.

"I was feeling it," Wiggins said. "I was starting to feel the game start to go my way, and I knew it was going to be a great night for me."

Wiggins was named the night's Man of the Match after he tallied 10 points, seven rebounds, and two blocks in just 21 minutes of action. At times, it seemed Wiggins could not miss. At other times, it felt as though he did just that. It seemed like his confidence just started to grow, as the last few points of the third quarter came right before the time had ended. His energy and aggressiveness paid off, as he nearly single-handedly kept the game in reach.

"I was just trying to find my rhythm a little bit," Wiggins said. "I thought I was getting back to my old self, and it paid off today."

As the night went on, the lead began to dwindle. For the second quarter in a row, the Wolves came up short. The Bucks went on a 13-2 run down the stretch to tie the game, leading to more panic among the Wolves.

In the late stages of the third quarter, it looked like a potential loss was looming. After being within striking distance for most of the contest, the Wolves were finally down by three points. The deficit ballooned to nine. The Wolves called timeout, thinking their lead was insurmountable.

The frustration would continue into the fourth.

Derrick Williams, who was coming off the bench in lieu of Wiggins, had an incredible individual performance. During the Wolves' final four minutes, Williams finished with 19 points. That included the game-winning jumper from the free-throw line to seal the victory and move them within one victory of .500 for the season.

A look at the final statistics show that in just over 14 minutes, Williams put up 13 points, six assists, a career high four steals, and a steal, three blocks, a rebound, and a steal.

"That's our Derrick. When we need him, we know he's going to step up," said Williams afterward. "He gets us back in the game whenever we get close."

Minnesota was able to close the gap in the fourth quarter behind Williams. The team scored 17 points in the final 3:16 of the game, but ended up winning the game on a Wiggins lay-up over Roy Hibbert.

"A little more of the same would've hurt," said Wiggins. "Roy's a great player, we knew that. But I can't make a lot of mistakes, and that's where Derrick can help us. As a team, we need him."

Although it looks like the first 10 games of the season have been a failure to start, in reality, that does not take away from the strides this team has made over the last few games.

This is an extremely talented team, and has played better with Love out.

The battle between the two teams was close in the first half, as the lead changed eight times. Minnesota went into halftime up by a single point, and began to
==================== COMPLETION 256 ====================
 get back in the game when Williams scored 12 points in the second half to give Minnesota a comfortable 51-45 edge with five minutes to go. After Indiana went scoreless for the remainder of the game, Budinger had his second consecutive solid game, finishing the night with 12 points and helping the Timberwolves take over the game with his strong defensive play.

"Tonight, I was just playing the game," Budinger said. "I'm all about working. That's the one thing I got from coach. He was always talking about hard work and I just did what he told me. Just been trying to get better and not thinking about how many points I've got, or the games I'm playing. Just trying to bring that chip on my shoulder every night, and tonight was the right game."

The Pacers' season has been a roller coaster of a ride, from a late season charge in which they nearly made it all the way to the Eastern Conference finals, to another late surge into the playoffs. This trip seemed like a good opportunity to win some much-needed games to ensure that at the end of the season the Pacers could be a regular playoff team:

"I think we knew that we had some work to do, but at the same time, I thought the guys stepped up for the win," said Frank Vogel on the Pacers' offensive struggles.

The Pacers had plenty in the tank—six of their final nine games are against teams that qualified for the postseason last year, and only Detroit, Memphis and Milwaukee are ahead of them in the standings. All six losses this postseason were come-from-behind games, and after beating the Timberwolves on Thursday night, Indiana will host Chicago on Saturday before hitting Brooklyn.

"I think after the last two weeks, when they were talking about a team that was out of playoff position, they are now talking about a team that won't be out of it until the end of the season," said Vogel. "Well, we haven't seen anything yet with this team."

It's been a strange ride for both teams and a remarkable run for Minnesota this season. This matchup is no less intriguing; Indiana has been the more consistent team, having held the Pistons and Thunder to a combined 30 points in their season series as they moved up from the second to third seed in the East. They'll look to continue that strong play against an extremely young Minnesota team with an uncertain future after the departures of Love, Anthony Bennett and Kevin Love Jr.

If a player is on the losing end of the first round of a four-player match, the game will automatically drop down to the second round.

In addition, there is now an option in Duel Decks to include all four of the player's starting cards (if you were not required to make room for them).

Oath of the Gatewatch, the latest Magic: The Gathering expansion, launches on Magic Online August 24! Head over to our website and start preparing for this new game with our prerelease events!<|endoftext|>(Natural News) On a recent episode of TLC's reality TV show "20/20," the "dirty secrets" of the modern animal agriculture industry were exposed by a woman who was interviewed for an in-depth feature called "The Dirty Side of Farming" (link).

Sandra Anderson, a certified holistic nutritionist, shared her thoughts on how to best prepare her meat before eating it. Although she's not a vegan, the woman told the camera, "if you're a vegan, you probably can't eat meat," as she displayed graphic pictures of how a typical hamburger meat patty is made.

As the "Sustainable Foods" segment progressed, and Anderson spoke up about the detrimental effects on humans from factory farming, it became pretty evident that Anderson was just a very cynical and dishonest person, as the following video from The Huffington Post shows:

Anderson's personal brand of anti-humanitarianism extends to her own family, as in an earlier episode, she admitted that she only has pets because her "grandma needed help" (VIDEO).

In addition, Anderson's mother was a part of a highly profitable cattle farming operation in South America. But she told the program's producers that she stopped farming animals because of what it meant to her and her family — "It was really hard for us to do."

As you can see, both the mother and daughter share a lot of the same personal traits, which should come as no surprise if you've ever studied the relationship between a highly emotional person and a highly manipulative person.

Of course, Anderson could just as easily be an actor, as her own personal brand of acting may very well have been what landed her on the "

What's more, the Wastes land symbol isn't on the original Magic® block cards with which it shares a common type. This is because the land types of all of the original basic land types, including Wastes, were replaced with their present-day counterparts, basic Forest and basic Swamp in Magic 2010.

Wastes isn't the first of the Magic 2014 core set symbols to appear on Magic 2014 cards, either. The other Magic 2014 core set symbols appeared at least once in Magic 2011 and Magic 2011: Limited Edition. You can see those images below.<|endoftext|>We're on a mission. If not before, now. We are here to make sure children are safe. As a community, we want to do our part to protect our children because we believe that is not a luxury we can afford to throw away.

Today, the Senate Appropriations Defense Appropriations Subcommittee voted to cut funds for the Child Exploitation Training Center by 50%. I would like to take a moment to tell you why it is important that we cut these funding and how other communities will be better able to do so as well.

1. Child exploitation is not a victimless crime.

As many professionals have made quite clear throughout our nation's history, child exploitation is not a victimless crime. We have to take away their agency and make sure they understand that their needs, their safety and their well-being don't matter. As a child victim, the crime takes something of my agency, something of my community and of me. We cannot allow children to be the victims. Child exploitation is an insidious crime that can be easily avoided by learning from your mistakes rather than perpetrating them.

2. Children deserve our attention

There is no doubt that the sexual abuse in children can and should be dealt with, but we cannot allow a "no-win" situation to take place. We have to be very wary. If we do not pay special attention to a children's needs, we risk further abuse, further traumatize them and even further entangle the community in scandal. If we do not take action, we will do even more harm.

3. We cannot waste time and energy.

If we ignore child victims, this tragedy will continue to happen. Child exploitation is an ongoing epidemic in this country and we have a responsibility, a moral duty, a moral obligation to make sure it is stopped before any more children are hurt. That means we have to protect our children and not allow them to be the scapegoats.

My hope is that we can do something together: we must work together. If everyone can play a role, then we will reduce the probability of another tragedy. We can all do our part, so my hope is that we will continue with our fight, our work and our commitment to stopping the sexual abuse of our children.<|endoftext|>The new film, which is inspired by a true story, has no such claims

After a decade-long legal battle, the makers of the Oscar winning 'Incendies' movie have failed in their attempt to get a cut of the profits from their adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel A Christmas Carol.

In 2004, Universal Pictures sued the late, great Dickens, his publisher and a number of his heirs in an attempt to recover a portion of the £3.5 million profits. It looked as if the movie would end up being completely legal, but there was to be no happy ending after all as the filmmakers were forced to take the case back to court.

They were originally planning to use the entire profits from their movie, but a new report suggests the money isn't going to the film's producers. Instead the entire money has been given to

A senior military official said the bomb was buried under paving in its initial explosion in an area the military believes was being used as a Hamas military staging area.

Israel was assessing the damage to the nearby Kibbutz, the official said, describing the blast as a significant blow to Palestinian resistance groups.

Wednesday's bomb was the first to fall since July, when Israeli security forces killed a Hamas commander and found a large bomb hidden under a car in the Eshkol Regional Council.

Hamas, which controls the coastal enclave, was widely suspected of having planted the bomb, with one Israeli source saying the group was a prime suspect.

The bombing marked the first time an Israeli army bomb has been discovered in Gaza since its military offensive resumed four weeks ago, in order to stop the group Hamas from digging tunnels.<|endoftext|>A British man has come face-to-face with the Islamic State by sending them an email in Arabic, but after several minutes, his email became "a page full of English words and the picture of a decapitated man."

As a response to the email, Mohammed Saleem uploaded a new photo with a caption which read:

"Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to you in reply to your email that you sent me today. I hope you will understand that I am extremely busy right now, and thus cannot respond to your email for a few more days. I am sorry for you inconvenience.

Wishing you the best of luck,

Mahmoud Saleem"

Shortly thereafter, Saleem decided to move on with his day, after learning no word would emerge of his email with Islamic State. Eventually a friend was able to identify Saleem to the British embassy in Damascus and subsequently had the embassy in Britain send him a message in Arabic to confirm he was, indeed, the man who had sent them the email the previous night. Saleem then responded with a response in English, which read:

"Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to you in reply to your email that you sent me today. I hope you will understand that I am incredibly busy right now, and thus cannot respond to your email for a few more days. I am sorry for you inconvenience.

Wishing you the best of luck,

Mahmoud Saleem"

As British officials had hoped Saleem was going to move on with his day instead of trying to retaliate by sending an email against them, the embassy asked him to send them the name of a suitable lawyer in a matter that had been brought to their attention. Saleem obliged, and the British embassy in Damascus contacted him shortly after, saying the dispute with Islamic State was now "closed" and that there should be a formal apology for the email.

As the UK Foreign Office has done in the past, the British embassy told The Telegraph the British government had an official channel for "dispute resolution."

"The Foreign Office has advised Mr Saleem in writing that the dispute has been resolved and there is no need for any further contact," a spokesperson said.

If you choose to take Wastes off the battlefield, you can't play an ability that uses its mana ability without paying its mana cost, such as casting an instant spell or casting a creature spell with delve. Once Wastes leaves the battlefield, it's no longer in your card pool. You may add Wastes back to the battlefield if it's still in the appropriate zone, such as your hand, graveyard, or your library.

In other Limited formats, Wastes will be legal in Limited tournaments as long as it meets the same criteria: it's colorless, it comes into play untapped, and it's not basic.

You may use Wastes, and you are encouraged to do so, in your Constructed decks because it lets you create lots of mana faster than you normally could and it enables your decks to run more creatures than normal. You can play as many Wastes as you like, but you need an empty mana pool to cast them.

New Artwork: Mana Titles and Portal Cards

As the first part of "All New Artwork for Magic 2011," we're introducing a new set of artwork depicting five new Magic 2011 cards. The cards include the five Portal cards and the Mana Titles.

Mana Titles

Each card has an unique mana ability that lets you tap multiple permanents equal to its converted mana cost, giving each one an additional effect when it comes onto the battlefield. At the beginning of each player's upkeep, put a token onto the battlefield tapped and pay {1} {1} . Each of these tokens has a mana ability of its own, and the tokens function while the Magic 2011 game is on the stack as if they weren't on the battlefield.

New Portal Card Art

In addition to these five cards, many new Portal cards are coming to Magic 2011. These cards will be in the same categories as the cards in "All New Artwork for Magic 2010."

The new Portal series introduces some great new designs for Magic: The Gathering cards. Many new Portal cards have a powerful new energy and new themes that add a new dimension to the Magic world.

New Magic 2011 Events

Magic 2012 will include a number of new Magic 2011 events, new Magic 2010 events, and a number of brand-new Magic 2011 events.

Events

Magic 2012: Three Events for Two Player Booster Drafts

The Magic 2012 Core Set introduces three new events. A new three-player Booster Draft has been added after the Booster Draft Rules and Procedure Guide that is designed to be a more casual experience, with lots of singleton cards and limited card selection.

Players can use these cards with other events or Magic: The Gathering games that are in the same booster pack structure as Magic 2012.

Magic 2012: New Draft Structure—First Pick

New in Magic 2012 is a new Draft Format that combines a Booster Draft with a Swiss draft.

The new format includes a single booster pack that has a new symbol on the front of each booster. This card draft starts with the selected item for both players and continues with a single booster pack that contains all the cards from that booster pack.

This draft format is designed to simulate regular-card drafts where players can only take as many cards as they draft. Players begin the draft with their entire deck of cards in hand, and each player chooses one booster pack and plays the game with it.

Players then keep adding cards as they keep drafting. The Booster Draft is a great way to try out new drafts or to test deck-building techniques with a small group of friends.

0 in the first quarter this year after leading 10-0 tonight following the first 15 minutes, and has not allowed a first-half touchdown as the Aggies have a 65-9 scoring advantage in the first-half this year.

With the win, Utah State improves to 3-1, which is its best start to a season since the 1978 team won its first five games of the year. USU also snapped a four-game losing streak to CSU as the series is now 36-31-2 in favor of the Rams. Overall, USU has now won eight of its last 10 games dating back to 2011, including four of its last five on the road.

Williams, who recorded his second-career 100-yard rushing game and his first this year, carried the ball a career-high 21 times highlighted by a career-long 58-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. Overall, Williams now has 10 career rushing touchdowns after his first-career multi-touchdown game.

Utah State finished game with 440 yards of total offense (262-rushing, 178-passing) and had 24 first downs that translated into possessing the ball for 31:04 of the game. USU also converted a season-
==================== COMPLETION 261 ====================
high four third downs and totaled six third-level and long points conversions, while holding the Rams to one first downs and converting just one third down. Junior quarterback Kyle Kempt carried the ball eight times for 60 yards (5.1 average) and had three third-down conversions, while senior running back Aaron Wimberly tallied five first downs for 32 yards.

USU had four sacks on the Rams (2.5 average) en route to the shutout and limited them to only one first down. On the offensive line however, the defense got two sacks for a loss of 18 yards and kept the Rams off the scoreboard.

USU's defense held senior running back Devontae Booker to 55 yards on just 18 carries (4.1 average) after Booker had a season-high 137 rushing yards and a touchdown on 25 carries a week prior. Booker had an 87-yard touchdown run in the first quarter to add to the Rams score as he extended his career-best scoring streak to 11 games. With Booker's 75 yards rushing and four catches, he now has 1,846 total yards through 13 career games this season, while Booker also now has 22 touchdowns for the season.

USU had a season-high 10 tackles for a loss (3 tackles for loss as a team), seven sacks (2.5 as a team) and two interceptions on the Rams, while junior safety Ryan Munro picked off three passes as well.

The Aggies also won a game at Weber State, the first time in school history that has happened, and now sit at 9-3 on the season, with a conference record of 7-2 and sit atop the Northwest Conference standings.

USU has now won 10 consecutive games in the rivalry game and 15 of the last 17 meetings between the two teams dating back to 2008. This marks USU's eighth straight win over CSU, including a season-best 14-6 victory in 2014, marking the Aggies' third-best start to a season in school history.<|endoftext|>From Diablo Wiki

The offensive line put together its third-best game in school history by holding UC Davis' running game to just 58 yards on just 25 carries and preventing UNLV's rushing attack from racking up any extra yardage.

In the first quarter, USU outgained UC Davis on the ground, 679-338, and the Aggies also managed to force seven missed tackles and intercept two passes on the Aggies last possessions of the half in the second and third quarters along with the turnover on downs that sealed the game with the first score of the night to open the fourth quarter.<|endoftext|>One of the ways that people in the tech industry can support our communities is financially.

best 20 fourth down opportunities en route to a 34:35 red zone opportunity advantage, ranking third nationally.

"We ran the ball today in the first half, and we really wanted to have a little bit more offense up front," Williams said. "We knew that there was going to be a little bit of a drop-off to a quarterback running the ball.

"We felt really good about what we did up front, we ran the ball, went through some screen passes, we did everything that we can do, so we're really happy the way that we played."

Utah State also was rewarded in its secondary with some excellent quarterback play with Kani Benoit completing 15-of-19 passes for 193 yards and two touchdowns and passing for another score late in the third quarter.

The Utah State offense scored two touchdowns to go with its two interceptions, while the Aggies defense gave up seven sacks in the loss.

"I don't think we played as fast or as well from an execution standpoint as we did tonight," Utah State defensive back J.D. Williams said. "I know our coach and the secondary coach is on top of it, but I think that we haven't been consistent enough all year and tonight was one of those nights. So we got to clean that up a little bit, that's on me, we'll continue to go back and review it, but I think we'll continue to be fine on offense all the way through the game."

Utah State, which ranks ninth in the nation in team passing efficiency offense, threw a season-high 42 pass attempts with its most productive pass play being a 13-yard touchdown pass to Ryan Nall, which was the most successful pass completion of Benoit's tenure and the third longest passing play by an Aggie starting quarterback since the 1990's. The Aggies also hit their first offensive touchdown on a 17-yard run by Josh Reynolds that capped off the first quarter.

A week after leading Washington State 41-8 in an opening round Pac-12 football game in Seattle, the Aggies opened with a disappointing performance in a 34-28 loss in the season opener to Arizona. The Wildcats outgained the Aggies 437-222.

Utah State is off to its best start since a 7-0 start in 2003 that still ranks seventh in school history. The Aggies return their top seven receiving and tight end targets in the 2018 NFL draft class with sophomore Demarquawn Williams and senior Jordan Wilkins already on campus.

Utah State opens the 2017 season with games against UCLA on Sept. 30 at Utah Stadium and Washington State on Oct. 7 at Sam Boyd Stadium in Salt Lake City.

The Aggies led 13-0 and were up 17-3 before the two-point conversion attempted by Kavontae Turpin with just more than six minutes to play. While USU did not gain any additional first downs, it tied the game on offense with six consecutive points as QB Travis Wilson connected with Kavontae for a 35-yard gain late in the quarter.

After trailing 17-10 at halftime, Utah State held on to win its fourth straight game and improve to 9-4 on the season after losing three straight to start the season. In its last four contests, the Aggies are 21-0 with wins over Western Kentucky, Fresno State, and Colorado State.

USU will get its next chance on November 17 in a home showdown against Fresno State, the highest-ranked team USU has faced since its first meeting in 2014. The Aggies won, 19-17, in double-overtime on November 4 in Mountain West play in Boise. The Bulldogs also beat Nevada in overtime, 24-23, last weekend.

USU now faces Idaho State Thursday, Nov. 17 at 3:30 p.m., and BYU Saturday, Nov. 20 from the Bronco Stadium at 9 p.m. with both games airing exclusively live on Mountain West Networks.

In the letter, the AHA calls out the NCE for teaching that evolution can be explained by the universe being created "at the same instant as our universe," and that humanism (which it calls "the belief that human beings and the world are the end result of a powerful, design-driven process") is "based on biblical belief."

"The AHA is concerned at NCE's misrepresentation of science and its misrepresentation of the scientific method and of critical principles of human thought, and it is concerned that NCE is teaching this inaccurate, science-denying material to students," the letter reads. "[T]here is simply no foundation for the idea that humans are the result of 'the powerful, design-driven process.'"

NCE President Lisa Vogel responded with a written statement about the letter.

"American Humanist Association is not content to tell our children what they should think about important issues without asking them what they think," Vogel wrote. "We welcome the opportunity to explain to any school board seeking scientific evidence that humanism is not synonymous with atheism but a very different position on many important social issues."

The AHA sent the letter asking for clarification on statements that NCE's "science curriculum was developed by experts in the fields of biology, neuroscience and psychology," and that "the curriculum reflects the work of humanists across the country and in the scientific community. "

According to the AHA, the NCE's science curriculum has been adopted in more than 200 schools throughout the country, and was used in the New York City public schools beginning in 2002. NCE also offers a science and history of science course series that contains material from more than 200 experts

You do not walk over a fighter like Bradley, Palm Springs, California, let alone sleepwalk over him, and if Pacquiao has woken from his competitive slumber, his chances for victory improve. Pacquiao remains the superior offensive fighter, and if he can sustain his attacks he should win—or at least give the impression of winning—the majority of the exchanges. And he will succeed at sparking those exchanges. Bradley is quick, but not so quick that Pacquiao will struggle to find him; Bradley is disciplined, but not so disciplined that he will avoid a fight.

 the truest sense of that word. An outstanding athlete, he also possesses the will and the determination to dominate, and does his utmost to do so in every round. But he won his first three professional fights by split decisions, and lost two of them. If Pacquiao is to have any chance, he has to beat Bradley.

Pacquiao has a long way to go before reaching his full potential, but the signs point to a good one. His opponent in the third bout, the unbeaten Victor Ortiz, knows this very well.

"I don't have a clue whether he's going to win or lose the first one," Ortiz said recently. "I'm going to try to fight my fight, so he doesn't get to throw any punches that I can't handle, and I have an idea what the punches are going to be."

Ortiz knows he has a chance. He is fighting in front of a crowd of more than 20,000 and in a arena that will surely provide a better atmosphere than the one at the Rose Bowl—and he has a chance, for the first and most basic reason. Bradley has never played it safe in the ring before. In their first fight the fighters engaged in a series of long rounds that was mostly free-form, but Bradley, the younger fighter in the fight, seemed to take an aggressive approach to a fight that he knew he could win. Pacquiao, 41, has had a few bad experiences at the hands of Bradley. In 1996 he knocked him down three times in the first round and came close to stopping him in the later rounds of that bout, but lost in a split decision. In 2000 Pacquiao won a close and controversial decision, and this time Bradley, 36, is coming into the fight as the favorite.

The other factor is Ortiz's conditioning and skills. Pacquiao knows that he has to fight with a certain amount of aggression against Bradley—his aggressiveness was at the crux of the original fight—but he also has to make the most of his opportunities.

"The problem is you have to keep him at 50 percent of his normal speed, because to get him to do that, you have to make him stay with you," Pacquiao said. "I have the power to beat him up but he's going to keep me at 50 per cent for the whole round, because I'm going to try to put a body shot on him, but I have to fight him off, so he can't hit me."

And there's the problem of the referee's stoppage. Pacquiao is a boxer of conviction and his will to win, even at the expense of what he perceives as his opponent's foul play, is legendary. However, in his three prior fights—with Ricky Hatton in 1993, with Luis Carlos Abregu in a twelve round boxing exhibition in 2006, and at the 2006 Olympic Games in Beijing, China—he lost in every one of them. A third fight against Arum, for whom he had made a good impression in the 2007 Canelo-Hatton undercard, was postponed for a full year amid controversy: Pacquiao was told by the judge that Abregu had been stopped by the referee after winning all twelve rounds of a three-round bout.

But in this bout Pacquiao is more than just a fighter coming up on the occasion of an Olympic appearance.

"I'm hoping I can beat Bradley in the last two rounds," Pacquiao said, "and then put it all on the table."<|endoftext|>A day before his birthday, a 27-year-old father of two died after being hit by a Toronto police officer.

 and out of the ring. That he might have become a great fighter through such a process is questionable, but the fact remains that he has proved himself. And although there are those who claim that he lacks physical strength, the truth is that Bradley lacks no ounce of physical courage—and, like most men, has not been afraid to make a fool of himself. Pacquiao has never been a brave fighter, as is evident in the various instances when he has attempted to walk his opponents through the ropes or, in more recent times, to throw them. In his fight with Zolani Tete, Pacquiao's first, Pacquiao took on what might charitably be described as a clumsy opponent. In that fight Pacquiao was easily beaten, yet he still took a beating for refusing to be knocked out. Pacquiao has been beaten several times and still comes forward and takes on the fighters he believes he should. He can do so because of his superior skill and his resiliency. If Bradley were in the ring with him, Pacquiao's skill would make the challenge somewhat different because Bradley's experience would prove a disadvantage; the same would be true of a more experienced fighter. It is a very good thing that Bradley, unlike the young fighter in his first fight, is not a fan of physical violence. When Pacquiao was asked about his feelings towards the fight against Tete, he responded in a direct way to all those who questioned his love of fighting. "There are people saying that I don't love boxing, it's only because I love my family and my children. I never loved boxing. I have a strong respect for fighting. I can't imagine what it would be like [to fight Pacquiao]. It's not a sport. He wants to hurt me. I'm not afraid to get hit in the face by him, and I can withstand it, and even when I hurt him I'm going to be OK. I love to compete; I love the physicality of it. But that being said, if someone wants to go and pick on me they can come and get me, and I've got no problem with it. If I want to get hit in the face, I will get hit in the face, and I will do the same to someone as much as I would someone else. If you are not happy, then you should fight someone other than me."

The second fight between Pacquiao and Bradley was a close one, the fighters jockeying for position as they tried to create angles and make the fight more interesting, and the fans began to tire. In the seventh round of the fourth fight, Bradley threw a hook that caught Pacquiao on the chin, and the champion was forced to stop the bout. In the subsequent rematch, Bradley won the second round, but was not able to recover in round seven, and in the eleventh round he was beaten.

But the story is not yet over. Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach said in the press conference that Pacquiao could become a "vicious fighter who makes people pay when they come into the ring". Roach also noted that his former student had been "an unbelievable pro," adding, "We will work out and I am hoping to do this fight in the near future and do all the things I need to do to do." Although Pacquiao has often shown flashes of brilliance, there have been numerous occasions in which he has looked flat. Roach admitted that Bradley's performance against Tete had brought the two men much closer than they had been between them during their first fight, though he continued to make reference to the physical attributes that have seen him repeatedly beaten. Bradley's most frequent opponents have been men who are strong,

He has shown his mettle before (twice before Pacquiao beat him), though he did so at welterweight in 2011 (one of Pacquiao's previous five wins, and the one that he lost to Bradley in) and last June in the junior welterweight and junior middleweight division, respectively. Pacquiao, too, has shown his mettle before (twice before Pacquiao beat him); he has lost five times to Bradley (one of those defeats by knockout), but has also lost to the welterweights, junior middleweights, and some of the welterweights.

For now, however, Pacquiao needs to find Bradley's chin. It is important—not simply to pacify his fans, but the judges he will face in the future. Pacquiao has to fight.

The Spaniard, who ended his 14-year association with the Mercedes team in 2010, is set to take the reins at the Grove-based team.

Alonso said he still has a lot more personal and professional investment in helping McLaren win the constructors' championship than in Brawn, which went public in 2010 in its attempt to sell to Mercedes.

However, Alonso also said his relationship with Brawn was "connected" with "the project that I want to be doing".

"After this I am at McLaren, with my team mates, with the people I want to help and to inspire," he said.

Alonso, 39, finished the 2011 season with third in the drivers' standings, one step behind teammate Nico Hulkenberg.

McLaren is currently ninth in the constructors' standings, ahead of Williams and Red Bull.<|endoftext|>By: Jay Syrmopoulos

"A massive amount of cash has been found at a private location" in the Dominican Republic, Dominican officials said, prompting a U.N.-backed investigation.

The Dominican news outlet Santissimo Digital reported that the cash was found in "the trunk of an SUV in a private parking lot" in Santo Domingo. There's no evidence the source of the funds was from any national government, according to the article.

The funds had been sent to a mysterious group referred to by the Dominican news media only as the "Rajas de Santo Domingo." The report said the secret group has been behind a number of bank robberies in the past.

Rajas de Santo Domingo was not mentioned in the U.S. Treasury Department's annual World Terrorist Fund Report, issued on June 15, which said that the fund "remains under-resourced and under-resourced-to-operational levels."

Santo Domingo had long been known as "America's Haiti," a U.S. State Department spokesman said when the country's U.N. Ambassador Jose Angel Gutierrez was first appointed. According to the U.S. report, Santo Domingo became "the biggest money trail" for the international drug trade by 2013.

The Dominican Republic was listed by the U.N. as having the third highest drug level of any country, behind Colombia and Mexico

 the finest possible sense of the word. He has done it before.

In April 2010, a month after facing an amateur contender in the welterweight division, Bradley, then 34, came up a step short in the rematch with Shane Mosley at the MGM Grand. Bradley was still the more accomplished fighter but, if there was a rematch, could the judges be more forgiving than the first time around? The answer has not yet been tested in the face of Pacquiao's impressive performance.

The rematch was billed as one of the biggest fights in the history of boxing, Bradley fighting out of his element. "The Super" lost the first fight by a narrow majority, and his fourth bout in five years in the ring seemed as though it could be another disasterous outing. Yet in the opening moments, the former four-division champion appeared to recover from an early knockdown, forcing Mosley to the ropes for a brief stare down. Bradley, as usual, made the first move, slipping behind his jab for a wide right that caught Mosley in the face and sent the challenger tumbling over the ropes.

For all its technical sophistication, this was Bradley's most devastating move. Mosley recovered and came back at him, but it was Bradley coming forward, showing an ability to score knockout knockouts that was almost unheard of in his sport at that time. A moment earlier, he had forced Mosley to the ropes and then finished him off with a left hook, prompting the crowd to begin to roar, and his corner to begin to scream, "Come on, come on, come on!" It was Pacquiao in prime form and, after the first two rounds, he had won.

The fight lasted six minutes and five seconds and Bradley won by TKO in rounds seven and eight. It was the third knockout of his career and the one that most convinced promoters that Pacquiao's skills were not only still in bloom but growing. In the weeks and months following the fight, Pacquiao's manager, Bob Arum, made it clear that no one had a chance of knocking Bradley down. He had already gone five rounds and was well on his way.

It will be many years before anyone will take a shot at Bradley in the ring, but in the meantime he appears to be in the perfect position to test his mettle. And if Bradley does show he has what it takes he could be the guy to beat Pacquiao. Pacquiao won't have to run, he will simply have to get past Bradley. Bradley has never lost under circumstances similar to the next one, and he's done it before. What remains to be seen is whether Bradley's experience will make him too comfortable again. How will Pacquiao cope under the pressure again? Will he come out and dominate Bradley, or, as he did after the knockout loss to Shane Mosley, will Bradley show courage and go in looking to finish the fight all on his own? It is impossible to say. Bradley has proved, though, that sometimes even the most dedicated warrior needs help from the best.

Convergent design means that Ubuntu running on all of these devices has the full capabilities of the PC OS (operating system). So Ubuntu phone apps can take advantage of all cores of the CPU, and the full native OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) and Open GL ES (OpenGL for Embedded Systems) of the phone's GPU (graphics processing unit), as if they were Ubuntu PC applications. By contrast, apps written for iOS and MacOS are subject to very different constraints, tools and capabilities.

The Ubuntu approach exemplifies the benefits of convergence—the same, unified operating system for all device types, and a family of coherent interfaces optimized for each category, but sharing many common features. The technical benefits of a single, unified OS for all device types is especially attractive for app developers (who can write an application once, and have it run on phone, tablet, desktop, TV and any other computing device) and for large enterprise customers and network operators (who can manage Ubuntu phones using exactly the same tools they already use for Ubuntu on the server, cloud and desktop).

Ubuntu's UI is arranged in a particular way that has distinctive and unique benefits when transformed across a range of form factors—phone, tablet, PC and TV. The arrangement
==================== COMPLETION 269 ====================
 is intended to be easy for users to read, navigate and understand. This means that the device forms and the interface design is more consistent and uniform, and therefore more flexible and effective. As with most UI, the experience can get out of line with user expectations. But Ubuntu UX is designed such that any user of the platform will find it intuitive and natural.

Ubuntu Touch is designed to be the future companion of Ubuntu 12.04. It features:

A new touch-based multitouch implementation with support for multi-touch input on touchscreen devices. The core Ubuntu touch implementation is very similar to the current GNOME touch implementation. However, the touch implementation is significantly more sophisticated in a number of ways:

• Ubuntu touch runs the full Ubuntu desktop as a full-screen window, with additional desktop apps running side-by-side.

• It is significantly more capable at handling multitouch input (with multitouch gestures, including 2-finger swipe up, 2-finger tap, two-finger double tap, drag, and pinching)

• It supports multi-finger and multi-touch gesture actions, including 2-finger multi-touch scroll (including pinch, expand & pinch gestures)

• It has a touch-enabled interface mode that allows users to interact with Ubuntu by interacting with it.

Using Ubuntu touchscreen (and other input) on an Ubuntu machine (and using it as a companion to Ubuntu).

How to try Ubuntu Touch

There are two flavours of Ubuntu Touch: the official Ubuntu Phone and the more experimental Ubuntu Desktop.

If you have an existing Ubuntu PC/laptop, there is an Ubuntu Phone preview of the OS (called 'PPA' 'Pre-Release Unstable' 'Preliminary Evaluation') available from the PPA Ubuntu Touch server.

If you have an existing Ubuntu Phone with an ARM chipset, you can flash your phone with the OS. This can be done by following the link 'How to flash an Android handset for Ubuntu' on the phone's recovery image page.

If you have an existing Ubuntu desktop PC or laptop, you can flash the OS to a PC/laptop on any of the supported ARM x86 (AMD64) chipset configurations (e.g., a Tegra 2 device).

For those without access to Ubuntu's servers, there is also the option to use an online mirror of the Ubuntu Phone preview and/or an Ubuntu Desktop preview.<|endoftext|>It's just a day after the election, and things are quiet at the Trump Tower in New York, just as they were before. Trump continues to be his own man, as he continues to travel to Trump properties around the country on his private jet, taking calls from friends and other advisers in his tower office. There are no leaks or reports of trouble at the Trump White House, although Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner may have grown tired of all the meetings.

In a rare interview with the Russian newspaper Izvestia last week, Jared Kushner seemed to downplay the importance of Russian government ties when he told a reporter, "the only person with a meaningful relationship with the Russian government is the President." Kushner denied that he and President Trump spoke about the Russia probe, but didn't outright deny it when asked about the potential implications should any contacts with the Kremlin have occurred during the election.

Now, a senior White House aide is warning the Trump family against giving their family's businesses any money unless it is fully disclosed.

But what if the man was an alien? For decades, people have argued that this might actually be the case. After all, if the human form looks similar enough, how could a human being look at all alien?

As it turns out, it doesn't really matter what we think. We could have sex with any form of life, including our alien visitors. That's because, while our bodies look and feel like humans once we've evolved past our primate roots, our reproductive organs are something quite a bit different from our neighbors.

Sex isn't easy (although you don't have to go on sex dates with it every day to get it — a lot of couples do this with condoms). How do we get it right? Well, that's when it gets harder.

You wouldn't believe just how difficult it is to get it right when someone you just met is having sex for the very first time with other creatures. I met him years ago during the day, in a small park somewhere. I could see him with a pretty young woman in a dark yellow dress, his white hair still short from his days as a lawyer. I didn't know what to say. I hadn't been around him long enough yet to know a lot about him, but I knew I had been wrong all my life to think we had the same body.

My best guess is that he was just a very horny human being. As the night went on, he told me that he had a particular fantasy in mind that included him, his woman and the woman's new boyfriend. I could tell he wanted to talk about it. I tried so hard to keep my mouth shut, but he kept asking me what our bodies looked like. After about an hour, I gave up. I tried to talk it over with him, wondering if it was a strange form of foreplay (because it wasn't something you usually see outside of porn).

We talked briefly, and when he went to bed, I started rubbing myself against him, my fingers working their way in and out of my vagina before he finally gave in and let me stick my fingers in there. I guess if you had one chance at meeting him, you take it. It was worth every second of the wait and waiting for the right moment. When we did, we kissed.

My first thought was that this wasn't an alien, but a robot. His body seemed very lifelike, with just enough of the human that it was almost human enough. When he had just about finished having sex with the woman, he asked for my advice on what he should do next. My solution? "Just relax and enjoy it." And that was the end of our first encounter.

As soon as I saw the second thing, it became clear that this wasn't a robot, and that we weren't even human. Instead, I decided I owed him a favor.

After I took him back to my place, I was very excited. I didn't expect our first time to be anything more than a short "fuck and get home." But as soon as I finished, I realized that I

Ubuntu's UI is arranged in a particular way that has distinctive and unique benefits when transformed across a range of form factors—phone, tablet, PC and TV. The arrangement
==================== COMPLETION 271 ====================
 is like a family tree, with the phone app app at leaf node A, the tablet app at leaf node B and the desktop app at leaf node C. In this way, a new phone or tablet app can be a completely customized version of an existing tablet or PC app, just as a smartphone app can be a completely customized version of a desktop app, and a tablet app can be a completely customized version of a PC app.

"We will continue to develop and optimize Ubuntu for smartphones, tablet, desktop and beyond."

In the past, desktop app developers had to build a "desktop app, then a mobile app". Now, developers can create a phone, tablet, desktops or even TV app that's based on the same code and can be transformed using the exact same set of commands.

This allows a developer to do things like make a new mobile app that takes advantage of a new feature, so that the developer can develop in Unity—where the Unity interface is integrated with the phone's core operating system and apps, and there are very few limitations. Or a developer can build a mobile app or a TV app that's just a simple version of an existing desktop app, with a few extra features added in Unity—so that a developer can create something that's just as useful on a desktop or phone, but much faster and powerful and with fewer bugs.

Developers who want to optimize their apps for a range of form factors will benefit from this flexibility too. To run on the phone, developers need to include the phone software, but the phone itself does not need the phone software (and vice-versa). Or we can consider tablets: if an application already runs on an iPad, you can include that app's tablet-optimized version, and call it a tablet-optimized iPad app; and vice-versa. Or something like that.

These changes are all very exciting for developers; it's great to finally be able to develop the apps people need for their devices in an easy-to-use and standard environment. They'll get the same familiar UI and control in the same familiar form factors, and with the same familiar tools for debugging and fixing. So it's not going to be too long before a broad range of application developers get a shot at creating apps for Ubuntu phones.

In the meantime, our engineers have recently started to work on new APIs for our new phone, so we will continue to develop and optimize Ubuntu for smartphones, tablet, desktop and beyond.

Q: What's the status on new phone hardware and software like the Lumia 710 and 720 ?

A: So far, with the recent launch of the Lumia 640 XL, there are some great developer features and enhancements for applications using it, including an improved device-management experience, a new and easy-to-use Ubuntu Control Center, and new ways to create your own themes and wallpapers. And as mentioned, a new version of the Windows Phone OS for smartphones will arrive at the end of 2013, so if developers are excited by the upcoming Ubuntu phone hardware and experience, they'll want to ensure they're ready.

A third-party device running the Ubuntu OS

So far, we've only announced phone hardware that's running our new Ubuntu Phone OS. If the new phone hardware has new and innovative features, we have no announcements scheduled for that part of the project. However, we have two high-profile partnerships with device makers and network operators, in the United States and Europe, to bring the very best hardware and software to millions of handsets. These partners are also planning to ship their new Ubuntu Phone devices later in the year, and I'm excited to see what they come up with.

By contrast, apps written for iOS and MacOS are subject to very different constraints, tools and capabilities.

The Ubuntu approach exemplifies the benefits of convergence—the same, unified operating system for all device types, and a family of coherent interfaces optimized for each category, but sharing many common features. The technical benefits of a single, unified OS for all device types is especially attractive for app developers (who can write an application once, and have it run on phone, tablet, desktop, TV and any other computing device) and for large enterprise customers and network operators (who can manage Ubuntu phones using exactly the same tools they already use for Ubuntu on the server, cloud and desktop).

Ubuntu's UI is arranged in a particular way that has distinctive and unique benefits when transformed across a range of form factors—phone, tablet, PC and TV. The arrangement
==================== COMPLETION 272 ====================
 of applications across phone, tablet and PC/TV is intended to be similar; to have the same look and feel. These two goals—making Ubuntu look and feel the same across devices—result in an overall more consistent user experience.

Ubuntu is designed to bring together computing and communication

In this age of mobile convergence—where our phones, tablets, PCs and televisions are connected together in the one device they all call home—there is a need to think differently about mobile computing and communication. The Ubuntu convergence vision is that we can use Ubuntu to give this convergence a new and powerful focus in the mobile world, and bring together people across form factors for a common purpose.

Ubuntu convergence allows us to create a unified experience that delivers on the promise of the smartphone OS—to bring computing and communication together—in a completely open and unblocked, interoperable way. From the moment we pick up a phone, the Ubuntu ecosystem can take the advantage of all of Ubuntu's capabilities, including our powerful phone-optimized user experience on phones, tablets and PCs, plus the powerful mobile computing on the move—connected and connected to home, work and play—for all device types.


Ubuntu smartphone with a high-end chipset, a full-featured camera, a powerful video codec or an eye-tracking sensor.

These capabilities will be combined to provide a very comprehensive, unified user experience for all device types.

The convergence vision for Ubuntu

The way we look at convergence today

Convergence has been a long time coming for our phone-powered mobile OS. When Ubuntu Phone was launched, we introduced convergence to our world with the Ubuntu phone. For a long time, our phone OS only supported the desktop. In April 2013, we took the next logical step with what we called "the phone OS on phones", opening it up to all form factors, with the goal of making it both easy to use on tablets and phones, and a full-fledged, universal computing experience on all form factors in a single convergence experience. Today, we are proud to report that almost 200 million people have already taken advantage of the phone OS on phones.

The convergence vision

As with our phone OS on phone, we see Ubuntu convergence as a journey, and therefore a path forward, with a series of stages.

The first stage is called convergence experience, a full-featured and full-featured smartphone OS for smartphones with a variety of form factors and performance capabilities, from an Android or iOS-powered smartphone, to a tablet with a high-end chipset, a full-featured camera, a powerful video codec or an eye-tracking sensor. We have already shown a couple of Ubuntu convergence experiences for smartphones, including some in the form of prototype hardware.

A fully converged experience is going to depend on a number of technologies: the open-source development and integration of components, the convergence of hardware capabilities, the integration of mobile device functions and capabilities and the overall convergence of device and app experiences.

The second stage is convergence desktop. This is a new way for users to interact with our desktop OS, to build, install and use applications that span PC to phone, from the desktop desktop app to the web based applications or to other devices. There are two phases: the phone OS on phone, and the full convergence desktop experience.

This will require new technologies and new approaches. The phone and desktop convergence experiences are going to be very different, yet in harmony. It is also going to require a whole new way to develop, test, deliver and distribute apps across all device types and form factors. Ubuntu convergence will continue to evolve over the next number of years to deliver a fully converged desktop experience

==================== COMPLETION 273 ====================
 what makes it so funny for all the people who believe that our political and national life should be shaped by facts, reasoned argument and rational discourse. In the past we have often suffered from the opposite problem: that the voters never get to debate the arguments for or against, because the parties and the media decide what the public gets to hear. We have come to accept that politicians are incapable of giving an informed answer to hard questions, and that voters will be misled into thinking they have found a candidate who will do their every bidding. And so we get to endure five years of Labour, with nothing much to say about its history, anything to say about policies other than to make them better than the Tories', and the prospect of an uncertain future with no firm ideas whether it will deliver anything at all. There is some justice, therefore, to the fact that Sun readers are right to see the result of the referendum as the most important political event they will ever participate in. And that means, in effect, that they are right: we need to get our act together. And if the Tories want to fight their last campaign with an anti-immigration, anti-British immigration message that will alienate a majority of voters and leave them looking like fools, so be it. But for the sake of being able to take the Tory campaign to the general election, they should at least be able to say that they have a coherent position on what the economy needs. If they fail to do that and simply get into a war of words with Farage, and if the referendum ends in Leave victory, as the polls forecast, the Conservatives will be at a great disadvantage, and with it the Conservatives' future as an electoral force, and possibly even their survival as a political party.

It is time to change the rules if we are to have more debates - Andrew Rawnsley, deputy editor, ConservativeHome.com We cannot pretend that today's referendum was fair. When Labour, as the official Opposition, came to a referendum it was allowed to speak in defence of the United Kingdom. On the other side we have David Cameron, who, it would seem, doesn't have enough respect for the opinion of the majority of the British people or their views to stand up for them. No doubt, the Tories will make lots of noise and claim victory, but they need to act now to ensure that the British people understand clearly what they are voting for in Scotland, and what they were sold. As for the other parties, at the very least they will have to accept the referendum result and come out of it with a programme, at least, that can be adopted north of the border so, on the plus side for the Tories, their opponents have to explain their position clearly. In the past, when the Tories lost a general election it was very simple to understand why. The party was left behind on the fundamentals, which are set by the economic position of the UK in the world and the nature of the British electorate (so much so that David Cameron recently declared that an "England without the Scotland" would become "just a big country".). However, the truth is that voters are more diverse these days. Many voters, both right-leaning and left-leaning, no longer want to follow the Conservative Party's line. It is not difficult to understand why. As the Tories have been forced to withdraw from power and their leader has become the most unpopular of all time, the party's support has plummeted, the public no longer see them as the party of "strong and stable" leadership, and their position on immigration, social and economic issues, and a range of other issues has been increasingly divisive. In short, the Tories do not represent the opinions of the majority of the British people. And that's why the public have no option but

 very significant. Cameron had come to London, too, to try to woo Obama. There are many good reasons to believe it will be a lot harder for Obama to pull Britain out of the EU. I know what I think, I could easily have said a lot of things like that. But the fact is that if you believe a Prime Minister to be a monster, you probably want to be able to get your grubby hands along with him and take it from him. Obama did not have time for that. His overriding concern is his desire for "a global agreement with a global agreement" on climate change. That is why he cannot be seen to be supporting the British effort to leave the EU. It is also why Obama refused to say that Cameron's opposition to his Paris treaty withdrawal was one reason behind Obama's refusal to go to the United Nations to support the U.K.'s efforts on the international stage. In my first column at the Sun in June 2014, I said that Johnson, as a foreign secretary, would go along to get along with Obama, and that Obama was, in other respects, a fool to trust him when it came to matters like the European Union. Obama should know by now that we, not he, were the real idiots in the European Union, and that Johnson was the clown who would get us out.

There is a lot there, and to be fair, I have a lot of thoughts on the subject. But since it was the New Statesman, I went for the original.

I do not doubt for a moment that the great bulk of Britons had their hearts in the right place when they voted to stay in the EU.

There are indeed some legitimate concerns that would have to be addressed with our withdrawal: the UK has large unfunded liabilities, an overburdened health service, rising levels of immigration, significant economic imbalance that could only be balanced by ever-closer integration with the European Union, and many other things.

The referendum on the EU in 1975 had been won by the "Remain" campaign because it was the case that the UK's membership of the European Community brought significant benefits, even though there were many downsides for the people of the UK. I do not, therefore, take issue with the referendum of this year. But there is no question that many millions of British people did have their hearts in the right place and that some people have expressed a wish to join the EU. There are also no doubts about the fact that there was a huge amount of disinformation, and the Leave campaign was very heavily funded and well-coordinated. That has been a massive challenge for David Cameron, and it will be for David Cameron, I think, to make sure that the EU does, in fact, offer many things for which the British public are grateful but of which David Cameron knows it will take years of negotiation to resolve.

I'm sure that most Americans will agree that the most serious mistake which our country has made in the post-9/11 era has been our lack of engagement in foreign-policy.

I would like to make one prediction. We will not be successful in winning this referendum. And that is not because it is a binary choice between "Remain" and "Leave" but because in the end we cannot win, whether by a big majority or a small majority. There have been lots and lots of polls that suggested a very, very narrow vote in favor of Britain's membership of the EU. But most of those polls were either conducted by people who did not know who had been elected President, or did not try to get at the real issues, or they were conducted among people who were not interested in foreign policy but who were interested in the referendum.

==================== COMPLETION 275 ====================
 not the first time Barack Obama has spoken out against Churchill. He has done it many times before, but is this a one-off? Obama's criticism of the Conservative party's attitude to Churchill is not even unique. He has described Winston Churchill as a "great Briton, the greatest man in modern British history … and a better man for it. He was a humanitarian, a statesman, and a great and good patriot." So what then did the President mean by the words he used in London in 2011? On several occasions, we have said that the US president is right – the Conservative party is wrong – and that in a general election if British voters are not told who the Conservative candidate is, they are likely to be misled, and the Conservatives will win. We have also said that when the electorate votes next week, we will know, and we will know in large measure because the electorate is not being told who is making the arguments. That is why it is so important that our voters know who is standing up for the people who voted to Leave, and who is attacking the people who voted to Remain. That is why we say that the Conservative party's current leadership's policy positions on these issues should not be hidden from them. So, when the voters are told how each of the Conservative candidates stand on these issues, our readers also will know who to vote for, without any need for a pollster's projections or a betting shop's odds that don't come anywhere near the real odds on these issues. There is no doubt whatsoever that the current Conservative leadership will give our voters a good reason to vote Conservative next week. In our view, one of the reasons the current Conservative leadership is giving our Conservative voters a good reason to vote Conservative is because, in spite of its own flaws, they stand for an alternative vision of the future. That vision is based on a belief that Europe is, and must be, integrated, and it offers a different approach to governing that will deliver for us economic growth and security without sacrificing freedoms. One of the major failings of David Cameron's leadership of the Conservative party over the last decade has been to give the impression that he stood for an alternative vision of the future on which to base his future position. What does it matter, he has said – after some of the worst economic performance for our country since the 1930s – if we leave the EU or have an even worse Brexit, which seems on its face impossible given the likely damage that would be inflicted? Our opponents would like us all to believe that we have no alternatives to EU membership and are all doomed to live in a de-EU-ified world. That would only be true if we refused to make any decisions on the future, on the basis that they would be unhelpful and wrong. We would have to have the luxury of pretending that no matter what we did – and that we do – we would be doing the right thing, if only because we'd been told for so long not to. But the time has come for us to stop pretending that. The Conservative leadership has decided (again, in spite of the evidence about the EU), that on the basis of a sensible Brexit arrangement, it is right and just to remain inside the EU. The Conservative leadership and the Tory country want to be able to take a more pragmatic view of our future relations with Europe, and we will be making a choice about the way in which we handle that future – either we will put in place a positive vision that is right for Britain, or the UK will be left with a more limited vision based on a limited set of powers. It is our choice.

Johnson should have admitted that there were no facts he could offer that could prove Obama's claims. Instead the former mayor of London did as Trump did: he reverted

 not some trivial matter. Johnson and Cameron have been trading charges since March over Johnson's immigration plan , which the Chancellor described as "not credible in its detail." Johnson thinks Obama is a Kenyan born with a Muslim passport, which is why Obama should not be able to have such an office on British soil unless he was born in the USA and registered to vote. Johnson's plan would allow the British population to decide if they wanted to live alongside Muslims in the future. Obama believes that the British people have more interest in foreign policy than in religion and will soon change their minds. Obama and Johnson are, in short, engaged in the worst kind of racial profiling. That has always been the case in American politics, but now it is exacerbated by the political situation in Europe which is driven by the growing influence of those most interested in keeping us out. Johnson's most famous rant came not when he was on Fox, but in October. Back then he was in a minority within the Conservative Party, and was running as a Brexit candidate. He accused his rivals of wanting to end freedom of movement – and thus to give a boost to mass migration – by removing the right of EU citizens to live and work in Britain. Some of his opponents found this hard to swallow. Michael Gove, for at least some of the time, was among them. Then last Sunday Johnson took the Tory leadership from Michael Howard. He is widely expected to do the same when his party returns to Westminster. When he does this, he has to make a decision. Will he support Donald Trump's anti-Muslim policy? Will he support the European Commission's plan to end free movement and thus increase migration? If he chooses to do one of these things he may do so for his own sake, because Trump is a man with a long record of doing the same thing. If he opts out he will be making it much easier for the European far right to claim political credit for the Trump phenomenon.<|endoftext|>Cable and DSL companies need to get a lot more creative before this goes away forever. The new Samsung Bixby has been billed as the first voice recognition feature you'll use without touching your phone. After all, it's not hard to imagine a world where you look at a news ticker and say "Turn it up," for example; if that feature even exists at all.

And indeed, Samsung launched "Assistant" -- a part of the new Bixby software that learns what you say and tries to understand it. However, for now only a small group of people can benefit from the feature. A few new Samsung devices already have it: the Galaxy S8, S8+, Note 8, Tab S2, and the new Tab S3. And if you do manage to use it, you will need to unlock the phone before it can do any real processing.

While it's a feature for the company's best customers, there are many, many more folks -- some of you, for good reason -- for whom the feature isn't useful and just doesn't work as advertised. And there are already many complaints about it on Samsung's support forums. For those of you on an older phone with the voice recognition feature blocked, you might be in luck: A Samsung engineer says that the Bixby voice assistant in your phone already has the ability to understand speech without the phone being unlocked.

It doesn't sound like Bixby will be getting the ability to understand voice that Samsung promised it would have in April 2016, when it first launched the feature. There are several potential reasons for this; including that the Android S8's Snapdragon 835 chip just doesn't support it, or that the feature might work better when voice recognition is done on a separate, dedicated device.<|endoftext|>TAMPA — "Mental

Sure. You can just run a WC3 mod on SC2 as long as SC2.exe is the executable of your WC3 mod and you use it with either SC2's "mod_load" or using SC2's "mod_unload" command line options.


It'll look pretty weird at first because some files are overwritten (i.e. SC2.exe and .txt) but it'll be fine by the end. Sure.

i like this idea, a little easier to make stuff like a replay viewer if we can have a game file and a game file with a different name, and a game file with game.ini and a different name and a game file like that, but you'll have to open WC3/scripts in sc2 to do that (and the game won't be loaded until it's opened in sc2). the only thing you'll need to know is that "files" and "playercounts" are the names of your replays/events so that will be helpful. i like this idea, a little easier to make stuff like a replay viewer if we can have a game file and a game file with a different name, and a game file with game.ini and a different name and a game file like that, but you'll have to open WC3/scripts in sc2 to do that (and the game won't be loaded until it's opened in sc2). the only thing you'll need to know is that "files" and "playercounts" are the names of your replays/events so that will be helpful.

I will say that I have never played an RTS like WC3 and even the older games like Starcraft 2 are in a class of their own in a lot of ways. As a fan of classic RTS games, I was really excited to experience an RTS of this stature that truly captured the feel of WC3, despite being played from a fresh install of SC2.


But I'm not really sure just how much effort went into this. I haven't been back in a while and I have no idea if the mods that I downloaded to help me play it are as up to date as they should be.


Edit: I downloaded the latest versions of my mods.

1. NoBots.

2. NoCheat.


Both of the following are from their latest respective versions.


NoBots.


Install: You install your mods using modpacks such as BSC and CwC.


Download:

NoBot_3.1a.zip


1. Extract the archive

2. Paste the files (including all the folders) from the zipped folder into your mods folder


BSC_Plugin.zip


Download:

BSC_Plugin_3.2.zip


This should be your NoBots mod. The download links should point you in the appropriate direction.


NoCheat.

Yeah, I don't know. When that original mod was released it was on moddb in September 2007. I played it a few years back when I was just starting to play SC2. I know I played it during SC 1 vs SC2 finals during WCG USA 2004 or so. Yeah, I don't know. When that original mod was released it was on moddb in September 2007.

Greetings, my friends! If you're ready to win over and influence people, how often will you have success with those methods that I've mentioned?

In this podcast episode, I'm going to share 3 secret tactics that you can use to influence people and get the best out of them – which may sound simple or obvious, but they can be difficult for those who don't really know how to do so.

You can hear this one, I'll try to cover another one as well, you might want to listen to both of them, I promise it will be worth it.

For the first one, I'll go step by step on why, I'll share a few of my own personal stories that made me realize that I may not be alone in feeling insecure of being a person with a different background, and also, to know that it was possible to change this.

Then, I'll talk about how you can take advantage of these methods, so that you can actually influence people in the process of changing others.

Finally, how to take these methods forward, and how you can use them in your own life to influence people, in business, in social life, in whatever you want to change for the better.


If you need some ideas to do this, you can check out my previous episode – How To Influence People – Part 1 on how to convince them to trust you, and what motivates them to do so.


If you need some ideas on how to actually do the first trick (not the trick itself), and are more interested how to take these methods forward, you can check out my previous podcast – How To Influence People – Part 2 on how to use these methods for a different purpose.

I think both of these episodes are very practical if used correctly, and they will help you improve your influence and win people over.

So, if you are someone who needs a little inspiration and encouragement to become more effective with those methods, then please be happy to listen to my podcast on the topic!

A group for people suffering from loneliness on the Internet wants to create safe space where they can go to escape the Internet and the constant online discussions, comments and socialization that come with it.


The first meeting of the newly formed "LONELY ON THE INTERNET" organization was held last month at the M.L. Kovalchuk Institute of Computational Complexity in Minsk. The organization is part of the Minsk State University's Center for Social Networking and Communication Technologies.


"In the future, a lot of companies will start to make their products available over the Internet," said Andrei Matochkov, an associate research professor.


"We want to ensure that people don't lose the anonymity they enjoy on the web. By forming a meeting for this type of people who don't have many friends in real life, we will be able to provide safe spaces that people have to escape to."


The group is currently working in cooperation with the Minsk State University.


According to the organizers, people suffering from severe loneliness should see a psychiatrist for consultation, and not be forced to abandon the web.


According to Matochkov, those currently in the same room with their computer have an 80 percent chance of getting into a relationship

, can we really trust the mountain dwarves?"

Even Sheyan was extremely curious about the Mountain Dwarfs as he felt it was a little odd. He thought about it and shook his head.

"No. Although the mountain dwarves possess extraordinary abilities, there's no way they would be able to escape the assault of the orcs! Also, there are countless mountain dwarves hiding in the nearby mountains. Even with their help, we will definitely have no hope to escape."

Melody was taken aback. At this time, Sheyan suddenly laughed loudly then started whispering.

"You're right. When the mountain dwarves join with you, even the orcs won't have a way out."

Sheyan then turned to Melody and spoke out.

"The goblins, orcs and other vile creatures in the world have no way to escape, yet if there is some kind heart inside their body, there are some unknown methods."

Melody's eyes brimmed with tears. She thought back to when she had found the vials of venomous snake. After that, she had immediately swallowed it and the poison had quickly penetrated deep into her stomach. It left an indelible impression. She had originally thought it would be a good thing but now she realised that that was the opposite, a horrible torture.

"Don't tell me….that the vials of venomous snakes are really a source of secret techniques…?"

Sheyan was finally able to coax her back to a point. If it wasn't something useful to the tribe, he wouldn't dare use it.

"If you dare, then try to swallow it, that's what I advise you to do."

Melody's face flushed red. While she was still reeling and looking at Sheyan, the sound of a loud knock-knock resounded; an elderly voice could be heard from behind.

"Hey boss, what are you doing! Just what are you doing? Could it be that it was really a trick to lure us in?" a female voice suddenly cried out.

Sheyan nodded, the sound of the door opening followed by a pair of cold hands reaching out for Melony. After that, two long faces that resembled an abyss could be seen as this pair locked her into a pair of tight handcuffs.

Melody's eyes were filled with fear as she begged for Sheyan to release her.

"I was just being followed by strangers……"

Sheyan chuckled.

"What did the other guy say?"

"He told us that our land was being attacked by elves. They used our lands as their base to build their underground base as well as abducting some of our members as slaves……"

Sheyan was stunned. Just the mere existence of the orcs had caused him to fear for his safety before but now that he finally learnt who these elves were, his heart shuddered deeply. He turned around and asked the elderly voice.

"What did you say?"

The elderly voice continued.

"It turns out that the orcs are trying to kidnap our women! I'm sorry about the previous sentence. That was a misunderstanding. Anyway there were a few females who wanted to fight back and escape but they were unable to do so….."

When Sheyan heard that, his heart twitched and felt his whole body quiver. This could be a hint that the elves were involved in the whole ordeal?

"I remember a female elf was killed by the orcs…. That was so shocking that even though there are elves here, they had no hesitation in throwing herself to death in exchange for protection."

Sheyan sighed.

, there's no telling when the orcs may return. The only way to survive the invasion is by finding a hiding place. Since your identity is truly twilight elf, if I die here, I won't be able to go back. Moreover, I won't be able to bring that stuff back home again!"

Melody's heart was filled with uncertainty. She wasn't certain at least, this guy could still return. Although Sheyan had left the town before, but the people who had encountered the black panther had met an untimely demise. Since Sheyan didn't know how the situation was inside, then couldn't he be thinking of taking advantage of a sudden opportunity to escape and return? He definitely had such plans! Yet, he couldn't hide in a deserted area, as that would mean giving up all hope of escape!

Sheyan was extremely cunning.

"This chest is worth a whole copper, right?" Melody was dumbfounded.

Sheyan pondered for a moment, then nodded.

"A copper!"

As Sheyan was saying it, Melody suddenly pounced towards the chest then took out a copper coin, taking it back to the side.

"So this is the value of this chest?"

Sheyan glanced over, then said.

"Of course! But if I'm going to leave now, is there any need to bring this chest back? It's too dangerous to leave here. Moreover, it's so that I can't tell anyone of our identity!"

Melody looked at the chest and laughed. She was extremely satisfied. She already had the confidence to go back and visit her own hometown. After this mission, Sheyan had been extremely patient with that woman, she had no other choice but to agree.

Sheyan gently opened the lid of the copper chest, and removed a thin copper chest like something made out of straw, a bit thicker than a human fist. His lips curled into a sneer, as he looked at Melody, then slowly extended both his hands and grasped the chest.

Melody was stunned into stupor. The chest suddenly emitted a metallic buzz. Sheyan laughed inwardly; since it had been so long and he found this kind of treasure, this meant that it was probably extremely significant. He reached around to look inside, as the chest heaved slightly.

Just as Sheyan was about to open it, an extremely soft and supple, yet rigid body suddenly appeared within it.

"Hurry!" Sheyan shouted. Then, he swiftly pulled out a white fur ball. He placed another piece of gold to it for the fur ball to absorb.

Sheyan then placed the fur ball into the chest.

When Melody returned to her senses, she realized she was still staring at a fur ball within the chest. However, she didn't dare to stop, as it was extremely risky even if she were to move a bit.

Sheyan was like a tiger, fiercely gnashing his teeth as he glared at Melody.

"I want to see how much I can kill you! If you don't tell me anything, then I will do whatever I want to you! If you dare to hide anything of mine, it may even be considered as treasonous!"

Melody couldn't help but laugh, her heart full of excitement from this. There's no need for her to act so timid, she knew that Sheyan wasn't like that. Not waiting for the fur ball to absorb the gold piece, Sheyan retrieved another gold piece and put it within.

Melody had seen countless people suffer in front of this guy before. So, as Sheyan moved closer and closer

, I want you to bear my child, wouldn't that be great?"

Sheyan's heart began to twist.

Although this chest wasn't worth much, but it represented a lot to Melody. Melody's face was red with happiness.

The elves could still cultivate the innate nature, how about I help you with this?

It was a good opportunity that seemed like a treasure waiting to be dug out from deep in a mountain. However, Melody had this sort of mind, she wouldn't be tempted by such a life. Melody was actually rather reluctant at first, though at this moment her face began to turn a bit colder. Then she said.

"Mister Sheyan, there is a method that allows one to cultivate the innate nature. It's called 'Blood pact'. It's a method that you may use to enhance your innate nature! Can I ask you to practice this method of cultivation?"

Sheyan was completely surprised. After thinking for a while, he realized that Melody's idea was truly too good.

This blood pact, Melody had originally planned to use this method to use it as a disguise, or even to hide it in place, then it would be really hard to see through. As for the blood pact for the transformation, if she was really willing to hide it, she could definitely conceal it. Otherwise, she would have to use this method to disguise it.

However, after thinking for a bit, Sheyan couldn't help but have his suspicions.

Melody was the daughter of a wealthy family. She was also the head of a wealthy family's 'family affairs', perhaps their affairs would cause her family a lot of trouble.

However, Sheyan was still thinking of this with a small smile on his face.

"Okay, just tell me now what you want me to do, what should I do?"

Melody laughed and said.

"Well, if you were planning to conceal it in this cave, then you should have already done so, however you can easily change your mind."

It was this sort of thought that immediately made Sheyan extremely happy. This suggestion was simply great.

"Then if it's the blood contract, then I might have been a bit careless. I just can't bear to see this kind of method of cultivation in the hands of another, moreover, you mustn't tell anyone about it. I will definitely not reveal it."

Melody looked over and saw that Sheyan's expression had become a bit serious.

"This matter truly is too delicate. You mustn't tell any of your close friends and families about it."

This matter should be so simple, but Melody's heart was extremely hard. Sheyan's heart was filled with hesitation. He was currently in a dilemma as to whether to tell Melody.

However, Melody's heart was a mess as well. If he did it, wouldn't it be that Melody will have to continue living with this curse, but he would also definitely have to face this curse.

Therefore, when Melody suddenly came over to grab the chest, Sheyan couldn't help but feel alarmed.

"Melody!"

Melody didn't return until Sheyan had turned to face her. When he turned back, Melody had already turned around and returned to her home. Sheyan could only return a sigh of relief.

However, an ominous feeling surfaced within his head. Melody didn't return to her home, but after leaving, she returned with a huge quantity of 'Pale gold' as she took it to the elves' home! She even informed them she had received this 'Pale gold' from someone named '

It is no answer to say ... that it is permissible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms (i.e., long guns) is allowed. It is enough to note, as we have observed, that the American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon. There are many reasons that a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense: It is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emergency; it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; it is easier to use for those without the upper-body strength to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police.

defense in the home. ...

The District's handgun ban also violates the Second Amendment.

That's a direct rebuke of the District's argument.

This is a case about the Second Amendment for the very first time. For years, gun owners and gun sellers have worried that the D.C. District's law on carrying firearms in public violates the right of people to bear arms. They were afraid their Second Amendment rights would be infringed. But the D.C. Circuit decision yesterday made it clear that the Supreme Court will review the issue before it, which gives the parties a chance to craft a defense without having to worry about it being heard by the justices -- and without having to ask the court to overrule Heller.<|endoftext|>The city of Austin, Texas, banned fracking on its public lands on Sunday, an action that has pitted local and national environmental groups against oil and gas interests.

The Austin City Council voted 10-1 to ban fracking in its municipal lands—including parks, swimming pools, golf courses and other open spaces—by an 11-2 vote. The measure applies to the city of Austin only.

The ban comes after several community meetings in Austin about fracking, many of which focused on concerns over nearby water supplies.

A study released this summer found that fracking could have a dramatic effect on the city's drinking water supply, since the chemical-laced mixture produced in the process can damage the ozone layer.

An ordinance that was proposed in 2013 would have allowed fracking but was vetoed by Mayor Steve Adler.

Despite the ban, fracking can still occur in the city's municipal lands.

Fracking uses a mixture of water, sand and chemicals to crack shale rock and release oil and gas. It is not used in other parts of Texas. Fracking, which is called hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking" for short, is considered a key part of the U.S. shale boom.

The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.

"The debate in Austin will continue," said John Hanger, executive director of the Texas Municipal League, a trade organization with more than 1,000 members in Austin. "In order for the City Council to act, it will need to consider the impacts of fracking on the community it represents. The city has no obligation to make a decision that is contrary to the interests of the people who live there."

In a letter to council members in September, city officials said that while there were still many scientific uncertainties about fracking, there was too much uncertainty for the city to allow drilling.

The city has a "comprehensive water supply infrastructure," according to the letter, including about 1,600 miles of pipelines and 300 miles of water mains. The city is one of the nation's leading water users, and roughly 85 percent of drinking water comes from municipal sources.

But water officials say fracking could contaminate drinking water due to the process of fracking, which involves breaking apart rocks, mixing sand and chemicals to release oil and gas.

On Monday, a number of environmental groups, such as the Sierra Club, Environmental Defense Fund and Texas Conservation Board, came to Austin to urge the city to reject the ban.

"A ban on fracking in Austin is ridiculous," said John Rogers, a spokesperson for the city's water district. "We've heard from all over the state that fracking can't be done properly if it is to continue — and it will continue. The question is whether we can afford the damage and environmental damage

defense in home invasion incidents. This is a fact not in dispute.

The Heller opinion is clear that Congress would have plenty of leeway to prevent criminals from buying guns (or drugs, or weapons of any type), but Heller doesn't say that the government could regulate gun ownership in all circumstances — or even that a prohibition on gun ownership might not be constitutional.

In an earlier Supreme Court case, United States v. Lopez, the Court looked at whether the Second Amendment is a ban on individual gun ownership rather than a license for people to do good or evil. A majority of the justices said that it's OK for the government to restrict gun ownership, but they disagreed as to whether that was a compelling enough reason to ban those who "have no right to keep and carry arms under the Second Amendment," even if they weren't "criminals." So the question before the Court here was not simply whether the Second Amendment is a license, but whether Congress could pass a law that banned handguns and didn't apply to long guns used for other violent criminals as well.

As a general matter, courts don't really want to find that a specific right is a ban if it wouldn't be unconstitutional under current Supreme Court precedent. But Heller shows that there are a couple of different categories of cases. One is when a law regulates a class of people who has "no constitutional rights," such as in a law banning alcohol. There's nothing wrong with that. The problem is when the law directly bans certain activities, including gun ownership, that have been legal for centuries, for instance in a law banning alcoholic beverages. There's a difference.

If Congress wanted to regulate gun ownership, but that was not going to prevent criminals from getting guns, it would be wise to look at what's called "secondary effects," the kinds of things that happen when the law reduces the availability of something else. The Supreme Court has held that this is a separate category, in which the law is not aimed at the evil it is trying to cure but instead prevents other people from getting what they might want. It appears that the District of Columbia and five other states have attempted to do that with Heller's handgun ban. The federal government claims that it's a "dangerous and unusual" exercise of its power to regulate interstate commerce because the ban is targeted at an "important governmental interest" and "disrupts" an "important market." The federal law is intended to "maintain the fabric of our society," and the individual right that's at stake "has a long and well-established history."

To my mind, the only way a ban on handgun ownership would meet these legal standards is if it could have been achieved through the usual means — such as making handguns less available to criminals and reducing gun violence — without creating a new right. It's not hard to envision laws that would go a lot further on both counts than the one Congress put in place. One big problem with the federal law is that it does not distinguish cases where the perpetrator used a gun against self-defense from cases where he used it in a crime of violence against innocent people.

"Second Amendment" and "Second Amendment right" are not the same thing. The Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms only in the context of militia service or as part of personal defense. It mentions nothing about gun ownership among civilians. Indeed, the Constitution expressly reserves to the people the right to keep and bear arms for the common defense. There is one mention of personal defense in the Amendment's preamble, which describes it as "the right of the people to keep and bear arms."

In Heller, the Court wrote that "an individual right of armed self-defense is clearly established" but also noted that there seemed to be some question as
======================================== SAMPLE 287 ========================================
 on gun ownership and use, rather than just gun-store sales, leaving future judges some wiggle room. But there are signs in Heller that a law like this is not acceptable.

Here's a relevant passage:

[D.C.'s] handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of "arms" that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose [of self-defense].

...

It is no answer to say ... that it is permissible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms (i.e., long guns) is allowed. It is enough to note, as we have observed, that the American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon. There are many reasons that a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense: It is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emergency; it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; it is easier to use for those without the upper-body strength to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police. Whatever the reason, handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-
==================== COMPLETION 287 ====================
defense in the home. In contrast, long guns are less popular...

But the Justice Department has been unwilling to put forward a reasonable argument on this point. The administration's brief fails to provide the kind of argument it has made in virtually every gun-related case it has pursued. As we have shown, gun-ownership restrictions such as D.C.'s fail on at least two grounds. First, they fail to target the gun at the people we say are most defenseless against armed attackers when we are talking about home defense. Second, such laws don't protect the citizenry, who are far more defenseless against home invaders than are police officers.

Heller was decided when only two states and D.C. had adopted local gun controls. But now there is no longer a 2 percent chance that you could lose your home to home invaders if it happened in a state with any kind of gun control. Some states are moving right along. In 2009, Pennsylvania passed a law limiting home gun ownership. Last year, Michigan passed a law taking away pistol licenses from convicted felons. In January, the state senate passed a bill that would require criminal background checks for anyone with a non-permanent firearm license, the kind issued to some gun dealers.<|endoftext|>In a recent study that was presented at the American Sociological Association's annual meeting, researchers from the University of Michigan surveyed 1,200 American adults ages 18 to 74. Some of their findings suggest a link between gender roles and political conservatism, but others raise a number of questions.

Researchers first analyzed respondents' political attitudes based on how strongly they agreed or disagreed with ten statements. The first two: "Women have fewer opportunities" and "I don't support efforts to give women greater control over their own lives."

After adding together this survey data with demographic, gender, and socioeconomic data, the authors found evidence of positive and negative relationships.

Overall, researchers found that:

"For men, liberal women, and people on the left of the political spectrum, more gender role flexibility was related to both higher political conservatism and older age. For women, liberal men, and people on the right of the political spectrum, gender role flexibility was related to higher political conservatism, older age, and lower income."

The researchers also discovered that liberals were more tolerant of gender role flexibility than conservatives.

"For example, people on the left of the political spectrum were more accepting of gender role flexibility if they had a higher annual income. But, they were less tolerant of it if they had a lower income. In sum, the people to whom gender role flexibility is most strongly related are not people in the center. Rather, they are people on the left of the political spectrum," said co-author Matthew C. Jackson, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Michigan.

When researchers added gender role flexibility scores to survey responses based on political identification, they found that:

"Conservative people reported greater gender role flexibility than liberals for being more open to accepting new forms of gender roles, but not for being less open to doing so than liberals."

For conservatives, the researchers said that tolerance of gender roles may actually reflect the fact that they support traditional family values through having children.

"That is, if you believe in marriage and the nuclear family, it is not a surprise that someone who believes in traditional family values would be more accepting of gender role flexibility among individuals," said Jackson.

Jackson also said that although some studies have suggested a link between political conservatism and religion, the results of the study do not support this.

"We have found no evidence to suggest that people who are politically conservative are more likely to believe in God, or that they are more likely

Whatever the reason, handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-
==================== COMPLETION 288 ====================
defense in the home. And even when a handgun is not chosen by a majority, it is chosen by a substantial minority. If the Government is to be faithful to the Second Amendment ... its regulation of handgun use in the home must be exceedingly narrowly drawn to serve an important government interest [like self-defense].

If this is constitutional, then the city could ban handguns from public parks, libraries, bars, restaurants and churches. But there's one more thing I need to mention.

D.C. Superior Court Chief Judge B. Lynn Winmill:

[I]n Heller, I do not believe that a handgun ban could be justified under the Second Amendment ... because I do not believe it could survive a Second Amendment examination ...

... [I]t is not the role of courts to create a constitutional rule for the individual states, and for federal courts to enforce it. My job is to do my job with the best constitutional reasoning, and that will often mean interpreting a law in light of other constitutional doctrines.

As a constitutional matter, the District of Columbia does not have the power to enact a complete handgun ban. The Court, however, has held that some kinds of weapon prohibition are reasonable restrictions on personal liberty. This case turns on whether "the District of Columbia's handgun ban amount[s] to a prohibition of an entire class of 'arms' that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose." Heller and its progeny support these findings, and the judgment in Heller provides a basis for these findings.

The city did not prove that its ban on guns for self-protection violates "the Second Amendment." The city did show that by banning handguns and some other weapons in places where they are most commonly used, the ban will have "a substantial effect upon the ability of some people to defend themselves and their families." It is undisputed that the majority of Americans prefer handguns for protection. The judge, however, never explained how the city proved that a ban on handguns will cause that "ability" to go away. Maybe there is no effect. Maybe just a small one. Maybe no one will have to get a gun to stay safe in DC.

As for the judge's remarks in other cases about how Heller should be applied, I agree with them. Heller, and its progeny, is not a decision about individual guns. It is a decision about the ability of states to enact handgun bans and the ability of government to regulate them.

But what will the Second Amendment decision say about laws that are not like the District of Columbia's? I think this is going to be a very interesting case.

In this week's survey, we take a look at our readers' worst workplaces. The survey is based on responses from 1,000 working Australians between the ages of 40 and 64 and will see the public asked if their job is a "horrible job", "mediocre", "solid", "good", or "excellent" workplace.

The results from the survey will be published every Monday on our website as part of our "World's Greatest Company" series, with some amazing results including:

Which country is best suited to a career?

The most common workplace in which Australians work is home - in fact the top three were homes with spouses and partners, followed by other families, where there will be a "significant proportion" of children.


Of the 100 workplaces people work at every year, 61 of the 100 people said that they worked in a home (including a domestic house/apartment), 39 people said that they worked in a school, college or university, 34 people said they worked

.

• Polyester double-braid withstands machine washing very well. We were not able to visibly damage any quality polyester double-braid (Yacht Braid and Sta-Set) with any wash cycle or repeated washing—even uncoiled rope. This suggests that gentle washing of polyester running rigging is quite safe.

• Avoid bleach (again). We tested the effectiveness of bleach by pre-treating with bleach and by bleaching after washing. In no case was a difference observable. If there is some minor mildew or algae growing on the tail of the rope, clean that portion of the rope, and set it in the sun. In our cooperative test with New England Ropes, it was found that bleach was aggressive in removing lubricants, roughening the texture of the line, and increasing stiffness, even when applied according to directions.

• Acid cleaners are very damaging. We pretreated several lines with weak acid cleaners and saw no improvement; however, the lines were visibly softened and damaged, and had less than 50 percent of their original strength. Some have suggested that you need to use weak acids to remove lime deposits within the core, but there are lime removal agents (EDTA and triethanolamine
==================== COMPLETION 289 ====================
) which do not produce any visible damage to the core. See this article. A very good test of the effectiveness of acid cleaners is to wash a number of pairs of lines with mild ammonia, use some to clean, then clean them again with strong ammonia.

Soap/Detergent

Most of the commercially available soaps and detergents on the market are very abrasive to nylon and polyester running ropes. However, some of them are stronger than many commercial soaps and are still good for mild washing. We tested commercially available detergents on various line types. All tested brands were good at removing grease and dirt, but the detergents were not very strong enough to remove strong adhesives such as laces, hooks, and eyelets (such as those used on an autopilot that is used on a boat where each crewmember takes turns holding it open). These can only be removed by water. If the line was being used, it was removed with soft soap and water. If not, some detergents were stronger than others, and some detergents were more abrasive than others.

Soap and Detergent are less expensive than chlorine bleach, and detergents are relatively inexpensive to purchase, and relatively easily purchased. Soap and detergent can be found in most grocery stores, at your local hardware, at home improvement or fishing supply stores, most pharmacies, drug stores, supermarket, auto parts stores, and sporting goods stores.

• A little soap and water is sufficient to remove most stains. You can wash several knots that have the same amount of lath and wire.

• Strong bleach will be destructive or highly damaging to nylon or polyester rope. The lath should be removed after bleaching to eliminate this danger.

• The detergents mentioned above are strong enough to clean some very hard and very thick material with ease, but when it comes to soft materials, you need a strong acid (such as sodium hydroxide) with some heat for effective cleaning.

• To keep from accidentally contaminating a piece of line with soap residue when cleaning with diluted bleach, you may want to hold the bleach bottle in your hand as you clean: if it gets onto the line, you can wash and rinse it off with soap and water.

• You may want to buy other, stronger, and more abrasive soaps and detergents which will give you better results.

Tension/Tape

Tension/Tape can be applied to nylon running lines when you are ready to set the ropes. After the lines are wet from the wash water, you can tie an overhand knot in the center of each running line and tape the ends to the end of the line with a soft material such as waxed paper or electrical tape. Tape will prevent the ends from hanging outside the latching points of the line. In the photo below, we used 3/4" double-braid tautened with 1/4" double-braid tensioned with plastic ties. It is possible to tie tautened nylon by putting the tautened rope through a loop over a piece of 2" nylon and taping it to the loop with tape (the loop should go around the top of the double-braid to keep the rope taut). Tape is a very good choice for soft materials and will not scratch nylon running lines when the tape is cut off. If the tautened nylon is used in the water, it should be tied with a double-braid of the same diameter as the remaining 2" of line; otherwise, it will hang outside of the latching points of the line.

Nylon Rope

There are many reasons to

.

• Polyester double-braid withstands machine washing very well. We were not able to visibly damage any quality polyester double-braid (Yacht Braid and Sta-Set) with any wash cycle or repeated washing—even uncoiled rope. This suggests that gentle washing of polyester running rigging is quite safe.

• Acid cleaners are very damaging. We pretreated several lines with weak acid cleaners and saw no improvement; however, the lines were visibly softened and damaged, and had less than 50 percent of their original strength. Some have suggested that you need to use weak acids to remove lime deposits within the core, but there are lime removal agents (EDTA and triethanolamine
==================== COMPLETION 290 ====================
) available that are effective, and no significant improvement is observed using weak acids. It is clear that these strong solvents are not suited to remove minor surface oil from fabric; they also leave residue on the line that is unserviceable due to its toxicity.

• Bleach might actually do more harm. Bleach is a strong chemical and bleach solutions left in close contact with natural, non-acidic materials, especially cloth of hair, can be highly toxic. Some may not realize that if bleach is added to the wet, wet, and bleached ends of a nylon, its presence causes a build-up of carbon dioxide in the wet. This causes the water to freeze, and can actually make wool and mohair "ice." This happens because the solution used in the bleach is also extremely powerful and when you apply it close to the fibers, it actually has the tendency to "stuck together," so the more you let bleach sit on it, the more often this occurs. The result is that when the solution comes into contact with the nylon, it causes the nylon to develop a hard, brittle "breath" that can even break apart in the shower—and is far worse than mildew. As to any possible beneficial results from bleach, these studies indicate that it poses a significant health risk.

So the bottom line is that any product (including bleach) that is applied over a piece of running line should be used extremely sparingly and only as a last resort—otherwise, the chemical itself is going to cause harm. With proper care, the product will have no significant effect on the quality of your line, the safety of your equipment, or the performance of whatever you're trying to create with it. There are other solutions. For starters, check out the "Tips From The Field" section of the Rope Buyer's Guide for more information about cleaning and maintaining running lines.

What about polyester rope made of non-chlorinated PVC? What is the health risk of wearing it, and is PVC safe? What about the chemicals used in making PVC and the process of producing PVC? Is there anything to worry about with that, or with some of the other stuff like vinyl, rayon, polyester blend?

The short answer is "no." When made of PVC, nylon running line can be made to last for many years. It is virtually impossible to produce any material that will withstand chlorine, or even mild chloramination (chlorine gas can cause a temporary color change in PVC). A great way to check to see that your material is not chlorine-treated is to look for the words "chlorine" or "Chlorine Free" anywhere on the PVC. If you see one of these on a label, that material is not chlorine-treated. For nylon or other materials, if you choose to use PVC made in China, make sure not to get it in small packages. China-made PVC is often packaged in enormous, cardboard sacks that are difficult to reseal, and can get all kinds of nasty chemicals on your equipment. As discussed above, we've found that using acid cleaners on nylon with PVC running line to be a very aggressive process that causes more problems than it solves. The best advice is to avoid using non-chlorinated PVC at all; it's completely unnecessary.

As for PVC that is made in Europe (like polyester), there is one exception. The European Commission recently issued safety standards for "polyethylene yarn, cotton, bamboo and silk fiber yarns." While the standard has no significant impact on nylon (and other materials), it does address several of the things most concern us about running lines.

The most important standard in our opinion, is the one that addresses "inflated fabrics." The

) which can be used alone or in conjunction! We think the acid cleaners are unnecessary.

• Always keep the headlight of the engine covered so that it does not absorb excess moisture from the sun and be used as a reflector.

• When the load is increased, you may find that the load capacity on the line decreases. This can occur because the load itself is moving a bit slower on the line, or there was a large weight attached to the line. Increase the load until you reach the point of load capacity at which you can feel that the load is moving only a small amount.

• In light rain, the line should not get wet as the line will stretch more than when it is dry. There is no need to pre-soak the line.

• For an even longer life, try keeping the tension at the end of the rope in contact with the rigging at all times, even while the line is not in use. This reduces the number of bends in the rope.

• When changing ropes and lines when using the line for a single trip—like moving from one sail to another—always change the whole boat at once. Leaving only one line with the boat can cause premature failure.

• When using single or twin ropes with a line of different sizes and diameters it may be possible for a problem to form between the ropes and to get rope burn on the rigging at the ends of the rope. If the problem exists, don't put the line through the rigging. If the problem can't be solved, remove the line and use a new rope.

• If possible, use the rope that is the same thickness as the line and the same diameter. In our tests, in all circumstances, thinner ropes had a greater tendency to "pop" on their end—that is, to bend when tugged.

• When a piece of rope fails (for example due to overuse), try to find a new piece. A rope which is out of line and does not bend in the usual way is a good candidate for replacement.

• Don't allow the rope to dry out.

• In cold weather and in a cold climate, if cold water is available the rope may swell or shrink. This means it can get more "spongy" or less "sticky." Softer or smaller ropes may tend to snap off.

• When carrying ropes up steep slopes, keep the wind-weight line on the rope. If a large wind blows down a side slope the rope will "snort."

• It is a good general rule to avoid heavy loads. There should be sufficient support when using the line for a short trip.

• Avoid tying more than one end of the rope to each pole. This will cause the line to be unstable.

• When tying to ropes (for example using a boat or ship's rigging), always wrap the line around the pole first and attach to it. Don't attach the line to the pole from the other end. Instead secure the line near the end of the pole, and then tie the other end to the next pole as well as possible. In addition to this, tie the length of the line to make a figure-eight knot at the other end.

• Use the lines when operating a vessel with heavy loads. We have heard rumors that nylon rope, when heated and pulled in the rigging, turns to the green color. This is true only when the load is extremely high. Also don't wear the ropes while operating the vessel. If you have to tie up ropes on the deck of the ship, you will be more apt to wear the ropes. In general, if your load capacity is more than 50 percent of your

The ruling effectively means that companies that want to move their European operations closer to customers - from New York to Paris - would be able to do so, because a country's laws governing privacy wouldn't apply.

But this could be a boon to US companies considering relocating.

"It will allow new companies to access more European markets because of a lack of effective protection," said Brian M. Kalt, a privacy law professor at Boston College.

What will happen to these US firms who want to move abroad?

Here's the quick answer.

All data are protected in Europe.

The only exceptions are the so-called "grey areas" - for instance when a company can't keep personal data because it breaches EU privacy standards and European laws protect that data - and a few exceptions in relation to public authorities.

Companies that do move their European operations to another country should take steps to create an internal data protection policy in the new country, and must comply with an internal regulatory framework if the new countries have similar laws to their home state.

That will enable them to move more quickly.

It could be a while though.

Companies will have to create new software and business plans to meet the needs of the new country - not simple feats.

"Companies would need to be able to establish effective systems for monitoring the data of their customers and employees, monitoring their compliance with the rules and the policies, and assessing the performance of the systems," said Jean-Pierre Petit, a lawyer who specializes in data protection and privacy at the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights. "This will still not be simple."

Will you lose your privacy?

No. For US companies seeking to relocate, it will also mean the transfer of their existing data protection policies and a copy of their contracts with data subjects.

"Some companies may actually be able to keep their existing data protection and privacy policies while moving to new countries," Mr. Petit said. "But some may not."

"Some companies may actually be able to keep their existing data protection and privacy policies while moving to new countries"

Will you lose access to US law enforcement?

Techniques such as encryption or VPNs that allow a person to take their privacy to another nation in a way which doesn't require surrendering all their data to the US government will remain available.

"Most laws that affect privacy and data are written overseas," said Richard Tynan, a professor of privacy law at University College London. For example, the Data Protection Act in the UK applies only to the British public, not its British citizens resident in other countries.

"If companies want to operate legally inside their own country they will need to be careful to maintain appropriate policies to protect people's privacy," he said.

 organizations assume that "Sales Training" primarily refers to onboarding training and orientation. Similar to an iceberg, where only 10% of its volume is visible above water, onboarding sales training just scratches the surface. The bulk of the learning process is in ongoing training enrichment.

Our Onboarding Sales training needs have focused primarily around the essentials: product knowledge, client personas, and sales skills. As the market changed and grew, the needs of our clients became more diverse and our training strategy grew to support our customers and our Sales Executives (SEs). By the end of the first half of the year (H1), the "gut feeling" from SMB Management was that further training enrichment was needed to adjust to the changes and as a data company, we turned to the powers of data for insight and guidance.

Assessing the Data

In July, I sent a survey to the SMB Sales team (SEs and Management). The survey asked for feedback and insights on training received in H1. It also asked SEs and Sales Managers to rate their level of understanding for each phase of our Sales Funnel and to identify areas within the Funnel where training enrichment would be most beneficial. It was important to me to ask the
==================== COMPLETION 293 ====================
 right set of questions (both qualitative questions and more precise quantitative questions aimed at answering them) to ensure that data is relevant to our needs.

We then organized a call with the SMB Executive team to share the results of the survey; we were looking for feedback on what we could do to grow the training and enrichment processes of the Sales Team. In order to ensure that we were getting a wide range of views and ideas, we scheduled that call a day before the survey was due to post online.

The next morning, the SMB Executive team received the results of the survey – which contained 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place ratings, and feedback on areas for change and improvement. The Executive team began to brainstorm to come up with action items for improving the training and enrichment experience – this was their first call on the topic of training and enrichment. From there, the SMB teams of all of the clientele came together to discuss and finalize a comprehensive training and enrichment plan.

This was by far the most productive call we've had at CRM.

Key Findings

Overall, 95% percent of the SMB Executives were in agreement with the overall goal to improve training and enrich our learning.

We were encouraged to find the areas in the Funnel that needed additional training.

The average SMB Senior Partner was very focused on training and enrichment, and that's especially true in areas in the Funnel that are not in their current sales responsibilities.

The most effective training areas within the "fog and haze " of training and training infrastructures were the "What to say" (the SMB Executives and most senior partners), product and process knowledge, and customer personas.

The most effective areas that would be beneficial to be expanded within the "fog and haze" are the "What to do" and "What not to do" areas.

We were told that more focus on "what to say", not "what not to say" was key to making learning meaningful.

We learned from the SMB Executives that there were 5 training and enrichment categories (out of 14) that they wanted us to prioritize.

Our goal is to continue learning from what the SMB Executives said during the call and to follow through on their direction to improve the overall training and enrichment experience.

The next step? By taking a look at their actual training and enrichments, and how they want to improve them. Our next series of calls will focus on SMB Executives from a large (3+ clients), mid-size (2 - 4 clients), and small (1 or less clients) sized companies, asking how they feel about training, how to make it more effective and enriching for their clients, and how to get better results from their trainers or sales teams in the future. There is a LOT to be learned from the SMB Executive team, because their job is to represent their customers, build trust, and generate sales and lead generation. So get ready for an interesting ride!

 organizations assume that "Sales Training" primarily refers to onboarding training and orientation. Similar to an iceberg, where only 10% of its volume is visible above water, onboarding sales training just scratches the surface. The bulk of the learning process is in ongoing training enrichment.

Our Onboarding Sales training needs have focused primarily around the essentials: product knowledge, client personas, and sales skills. As the market changed and grew, the needs of our clients became more diverse and our training strategy grew to support our customers and our Sales Executives (SEs). By the end of the first half of the year (H1), the "gut feeling" from SMB Management was that further training enrichment was needed to adjust to the changes and as a data company, we turned to the powers of data for insight and guidance.

Assessing the Data

In July, I sent a survey to the SMB Sales team (SEs and Management). The survey asked for feedback and insights on training received in H1. It also asked SEs and Sales Managers to rate their level of understanding for each phase of our Sales Funnel and to identify areas within the Funnel where training enrichment would be most beneficial. It was important to me to ask the
==================== COMPLETION 294 ====================
 teams to rate their level of understanding and the effectiveness of training so that we could see trends and make changes, without having to re-train each employee. I wanted to know if this was something that the sales forces agreed with and if it was what our business, our culture, and our customers were wanting.

Based on this survey, I discovered that nearly everyone was surprised in their experience with SEL Training and this prompted me to ask Sales Executives for their thoughts—and, if possible, share them with our Sales Training team. To me, this survey was a success in that it allowed me to hear from our customers. In particular, I was interested in hearing how the teams felt about:

1) Training and support for each phase, from onboarding to retention,

2) The difference between onboarding for sales, sales and marketing,

3) Training around the sales process,

4) Training around the customer relationship, and

5) Training around the marketing process, which was the largest of those I asked for in my survey and which was very difficult for many people. (See Appendix 1.)

I then took another look at the data and decided this was a great opportunity to take our Onboarding Sales training to the next level and provide feedback directly to our customers.

Using Social Media

Social media is one of the most powerful tools we have at Shopify. Social media allows us to reach our customers directly, engage in meaningful conversations, build networks with our customers, and drive engagement. The most important piece of the social mix is the ability to build a digital profile that allows our customers to find us and ask questions. Social media also allows us to share our stories directly with our customers and gain new customers.

There are two parts to this equation that must work in tandem to help our customers succeed: training and support. We have the technology and the expertise (in Salesforce) to help our customers succeed on every level. We need to develop our training and support programs to support our clients to keep up with our new marketing tactics. These programs will help our customers grow and succeed.

Onboarding Sales was born out of a partnership with Shopify and its marketing and sales teams. The goal of the Onboarding Sales Training program is to help our clients learn how to onboard faster and in a less intimidating, more interactive way. Our program helps customers understand the ins and outs of onboarding and enables them to succeed with Shopify. In this respect, we are the "trainers" who are helping our clients onboard, not the other way around.

I'm excited that Onboarding Sales Training will connect us directly with you as we create the best training and support program possible for your business. We are looking for feedback and can be reached at sales@onboarding.sales.com or by emailing support@onboarding.sales.com.

This post is a part of a series of post written by Chris Brogan for Shopify's sales and service teams. This series is a way for us to provide some insight into issues and discussions that are common in the sales and service world.

I was curious to see how it has performed after all of the rumors about new features being added and what the impact on the ecosystem of people who are actively using Apple TV. In the past, I would just have the Apple TV on my desk and use it as a remote control. I figured if I was going to spend any time on the Apple TV, I would want something to control it from my Mac.

It also asked SEs and Sales Managers to rate their level of understanding for each phase of our Sales Funnel and to identify areas within the Funnel where training enrichment would be most beneficial. It was important to me to ask the
==================== COMPLETION 295 ====================
 questions early on, even before the training material had been released for the H1 2016 training, so that my feedback could take place at a very early stage. While our SMB training is designed to reach an informed decision making process, I was concerned that the responses would come in very general form and without any specific feedback. This would create a skewed report, if we focused exclusively on the information received from the survey.

One of the questions we asked was, "If you had to design the next iteration of our onboarding training, what would you add next?" We received responses from all of our teams and the feedback we received was a mixture of enthusiasm but also some criticism about the lack of quality in many of our products. I also heard about "dead on arrival", (where the customer doesn't complete training) or what we call "one-click" sales training (for example, "If you enter this code and you are a new customer, I'll send you a $299.99 offer."). In the past year we've been experimenting with various ways to increase the level of engagement throughout our onboarding training and we are very excited about the results. Let me outline four of the biggest changes we are trying this year to improve the quality of our training and make it more meaningful and impactful:

Data

We are using a number of different analytics tools to track the feedback we are getting from new customers and new recruits. For our current and future customer acquisition efforts, we are focusing on identifying the specific needs and the challenges that their market organizations are facing. For example, when we look at the challenge groups of our onboarding training (salesperson, technical consultant, product specialist, etc.), it is very clear that each needs an education on how to sell to specific demographics. As a company, we believe it's best for our clients to have this experience with a trained salesperson, a technical consultant, or even a customer representative who represents their specific problem for them.

However, we know that it's important for our new recruit to receive specific training on how to market a product to specific buyers in a new environment. In one of the workshops we conducted in September, we covered a range of topics like building and scaling up a sales team, selling on social media, and handling new or unfamiliar market environments. We designed what I called a "roadmap to customer success" to help us understand what these specific challenges were for our new recruits. It was our intent to create a series of questions that would allow our SEs more creative control of how best to guide new recruits through the onboarding learning experience.

In addition to the new onboarding materials and trainings, I'm also implementing a number of other techniques that we believe have had positive effects on the overall onboarding training experience. For example, we are using a series of training workshops designed for our sales representatives on building trust, being authentic, and creating new markets. Additionally, we are using an online training platform called The LeadZone to introduce our recruiters to some of the more advanced tools that will be useful when their new recruit is a full-fledged SME. In the future, I plan to use The LeadZone to deliver the same training that I do in the "Roadmap to Customer Success" workshops but in another online platform and format.

Learning

I am excited to implement an approach that I call, "Acquired Learner Based Education". By using a combination of social media, email marketing, and live call-in training, we intend to provide our new recruits with training that is more engaging and relevant each time they learn a lesson.

The idea is that each time we have a new hire come in to our organization, we want them to feel as

It was important to me to ask the
==================== COMPLETION 296 ====================
 Sales Team where they felt they were learning most from the data, because the data helped me to find ways best to enhance our training.

I began to explore the data from the first half of the year, based on my own training experiences and those the team had sent the survey to. I started to notice correlations between the survey answers and what we found through our data analysis.

To my surprise, the survey questions also reflected a need I recognized from our clients: The team was asking for more "deep training" on topics including sales skills, sales development, and sales process and how to apply these values to every day work in the Sales Funnel. We didn't see these topics represented in the data, but we did see that the top three needs among our clients were:

1. Awareness – This is a must as people are constantly learning and acquiring knowledge outside the direct selling realm. To keep pace with the speed of change, our clients want to have more training for "what's coming next," a deep dive on new market opportunities.

2. Training – The second most common question was to "expand the training process." The top three questions were "can we incorporate more on-boarding into our sales process?" "How can I expand my knowledge/skills through training?" and "how can I provide ongoing training to enhance my existing skills." While we often focus on onboarding as an activity, our clients were clearly looking for ongoing value and training to enhance their skills.

3. Sales Cycle – There is a demand for "training at the end of the sales cycle." The top three types of training we got feedback on, were, "I would like more on-boarding/training as part of the sales cycle," "how can I improve my capacity/solve issues as part of the sales cycle," and "I would like to have more training focused on skills and attributes that contribute to my sales function."

Our data revealed that only 6% of the respondents were able to identify the most effective (and/or time sensitive) training that we could integrate into the sales cycle. We were able to answer the top 3 questions. Of the remaining 90% of respondents, 70% said they identified the top 3 questions that they wanted us to answer in the second annual survey.

Here is what we found:

We realized quickly that the majority of our clients (78%) wanted to learn more from our data. We also realized that we needed to start to build on what we were learning in the second annual survey. We worked with SEs and Sales Directors to develop new ways to incorporate data into trainings to help us answer these questions, and to help our clients better understand their roles and their sales cycle.

To help our clients better understand the data (including areas of potential future work) and our new opportunities to improve their roles in the Funnel (e.g. helping clients create more complex sales cycle activities), let's look at the top 3 questions we answered from this second survey and what we found.

First, we focused our attention on areas that were more complicated. The top three that we focused on included:

Sales Funnel Process (6%)

Conducting Sales Calls (6%)

Finance, IT, Sales – (6%)

This focus on areas that were more complex for the training to address was a positive and helped us align our training with our sales performance. Also, having a focus of more complex questions allowed us to create a "framework" of areas of specific expertise that we can further expand. We will revisit this topic in later posts as we progress in our training process.

Second, we focused our attention on what our SEs and Directors had identified
======================================== SAMPLE 297 ========================================
d we again drifted well to the west, to 72° 56′, but from that time the backward drift predominated, placing us at 79° 52′ on September 6th, or about the same longitude as we started from on June 29th. During this period the weather was, on the whole, fair and mild. Occasionally we had some bad weather, with drift-snow and sleet, compelling us to stay indoors. However, the bad weather did not worry us much; on the contrary, we looked rather eagerly for changes in the weather, especially if they revived our hopes of a good drift westward, with a prospect of soon getting out of our prison. It must not be understood that we dreaded another winter in the ice before getting home. We had provisions enough, and everything else needful to get over some two or three polar winters, if necessary, and we had a ship in which we all placed the fullest confidence, in view of the many tests she had been put to. We were all sound and healthy, and had learned to stick ever closer to one another for better and for worse. With regard to Nansen and Johansen, hardly any of us entertained serious fears; however dangerous their trip was, we were not afraid that they
==================== COMPLETION 297 ====================
 would never come home or that the weather would prove to be too severe for them to make their journey. Nansen was a little more nervous, but not so much so as he had been several years before; and Johansen, who in the previous year had almost lost his life after one of the heavy nights in the south-western polar regions, grew no more melancholy than he had been on the previous autumn.

As the day wore on, our fears disappeared. Our hopes of a good drift along shoreward began, and were only weakened with the knowledge that there was a very great chance of a change of situation. We were not, however, so ready to give up for lost as the others; and we waited to see what might take place.

After twelve hours of long silence we began to hear some unusual noises. We were just going up to the top of the lighthouse now to see what was going on when the sound seemed at first to be coming from the land. It could evidently be the ship's whistle, for all we heard was a short series of rumbling intervals. Presently the whistling was much greater, very loud, and very piercing. The sound was continually increasing, and at length we perceived that a large part of the ship's hull was vibrating violently under it and breaking away from its own centre, like a broken tooth having its tooth knocked out by a nail. The ship seemed to be swaying at the rate of some three or four feet per minute, and the whole of the crew felt a curious exhilaration, the effect of which was to make us almost dizzy. We were in the midst of our ship's journey at this time, and it was impossible to stop our own motion for any considerable length of time, so we hastened our course homeward, and, when our vessel had arrived a few miles from the shore, sat down to listen for anything more to the effect of the whistle, which seemed to continue with the same intensity until it reached the sea.

"What is the matter?" asked Johansen, looking at me with a curious air of wonder and surprise, as we were all leaning over the bulwarks. Johansen was one of the best sailors in the world, and during nine months of intense service in the Southern Ocean had no other friend with him. He was not in his right mind on this occasion, and we were all equally surprised, to say the least. We talked away till the sea began to tremble, and there was no answering whistling from the ship. That was the end of it. When the trembling of the sea passed away, and we started up again, we saw that the ship was a little below the surface, and we thought the matter must be settled.

The weather seemed to improve from that time forward, but even that time our dreams of another winter still held out. We kept the ship up for as long as we could, but when we had made it up to the last point, and the boat was drifting out of the mouth of the bay and away into deep sea, we put the ship into a position that gave her as much wind as we could stand, with all sails set, and hauled the boat to the eastward of the land. We were now in a place of great latitude, at a place where the winds, while somewhat calm down by the land, were decidedly blowing, and which, in a few hours, would blow in the direction of Iceland.

We had a long search on, as the day wore on and we had no sign of the ship. I had been thinking that we should find her by the north-north-west star, since she took that south- east course, and had been in the habit of looking at

With regard to Nansen and Johansen, hardly any of us entertained serious fears; however dangerous their trip was, we were not afraid that they
==================== COMPLETION 298 ====================
 would die of the voyage, for we were more than aware of the enormous effort involved in such a long voyage. Besides, we were all ready to give their lives in the undertaking, when it was in their power, so that no one doubted that our men would get out safely and get back to their families. As our ship was the little Pallas, her strength was very doubtful, and with this she was bound to lose a good deal of her crew. They all knew that her crew was no place for weaklings, but they knew also that our ship had one of the strongest iron sails in the world, and all felt that with our aid she had the power to overcome the ice. Nansen and Johansen's spirits were up, and even Pabodie and Hansen were cheerful and animated by the prospect of the voyage. For two or three weeks the weather was fair, but, on September 14th and 15th, it became unusually cold and stormy. The ice was thick and strong. We could hardly see anything through it. The wind was fresh, and a light breeze from the westward helped us. This freshened our spirits temporarily, but, on the 20th, another cold storm set in. The temperature fell to 0° Fahr., which was only a couple of degrees above zero; but it was a storm with plenty of snow and sleet. It was almost impossible to keep ourselves warm. In a few days several bodies fell into the sea, and were only saved by the calm sea, though they suffered very much, from their position in the ship. Nansen was suffering much with frost bites; he could hardly move at all, and was much frightened at any attempt to move him out of his bunk. Johansen was very ill with a fever, and was a very weak man. The whole crew was suffering from cold. On the 26th Nansen's fever increased. He was in a feverish state, and was so weak that he was unable to stand up. He was laid out on the forecastle, and Pabodie had to lift him to the deck with a ladder. He died that same day.

—[On the morning of the 26th, August 1869, the weather changed. The winds changed from north southeast, with heavy squalls, to south southwest, with fair winds and fair weather. The temperature dropped so quickly to 0° Fahr. that, while we were at the whaling-station, the whole crew, with the exception of Pabodie, was laid down with their clothes, and there the ice started at the door, as it had been prepared for them at the whaling-station, and spread away from the cabin roof. The ice was very thick, and we had to get under our clothes and into our bunks, and then we had to get out into the open for air. We were in one of the bunks at 0° Fahr. As soon as the ice began to separate from the wood, the frost-bitten men found that they could stand it no longer and were removed out into the open. I was among the first, when I was moved out on the deck (the men called up to me, in German, "Weersehen"), but I could not stand it much longer. I was so weak that I was nearly incapable of sitting or standing, but a little help gave me a little success, and I was lifted up by Pabodie and taken out into the open. By this time, though, the frost had developed so thickly upon me that I was able to stand the cold, though with much trouble, and was taken into the cabins by Pabodie, who remained behind with a small fire to keep

d we again drifted well to the west, to 72° 56′, but from that time the backward drift predominated, placing us at 79° 52′ on September 6th, or about the same longitude as we started from on June 29th.

With regard to Nansen and Johansen, hardly any of us entertained serious fears; however dangerous their trip was, we were not afraid that they
==================== COMPLETION 299 ====================
 would not reach home safe. Of course we had no doubt on account of the danger of the ice and drift-snow, which would have made it impossible for them to reach the ship safely. But the most significant feature in the trip was the fact that they made good time, as we had thought impossible. The day after leaving the ice-port, when the drift began to get heavy, they had only to lay the ship out on to the ice some distance to the westward, and then to cut across it at intervals, as they went along, till they reached its other end, making one end of a new line of ice as they went along it. This course might easily have been followed at our own speed; and we would perhaps have reached the land after ten days, had not the drift gotten too serious. After they had traversed nearly two hundred miles of ice, the drift became too great even for that to be possible. We had no alternative, therefore, but to give up the attempt, but with good hearts and good spirits. When this had passed all expectation, we now proceeded to look forward a little in view of my departure.

The following summer I began to feel more at home in Norway, and there I began to put myself in relations with the people of the country. I found that they had heard all about my trip to the south-west and had many questions to add to what I could say in answer to them. This brought me into contact with my own friends, as well as with a great many Norwegians who had no news of the expedition from the south. On September 7, 1897, the first day of the new season, the little boat I had brought with me to the north-eastern coast had become the boat with which we made the journey back again. We had a day to get to Stromness on our return trip, and I was happy to have done that before the first cold day had completely laid hold on us. But as we were passing some of the most dangerous places in the country—the northern end of the Lofoten archipelago in summer, for instance, along the western coasts of the main glaciers of the country, and in many other places during the years of our summer visits to the country—I was careful to keep on the south-west as far as possible, and was therefore relieved to get across as long a distance as I could. It is an illusion to think of having to push north, because this could only be done at the rate at which a polar expedition was travelling. With my small small boat, even in the open air, I reached Stromness after thirteen hours of steaming for thirty-four. It was now September 13, and on the following day we came to anchor, and on that day there was nothing more to do. On the next morning we had about one and a half hours before sunrise, leaving the ship for the day to make a port near the island where we had started. But at the first light we had to start again immediately. The first point of land was reached within a few minutes—a fairly large beach, about five hundred yards long, and as wide—this point lying on the south-western portion of the island. The coast had a very beautiful appearance, and it was well lighted by the sun.

On the morning of September 15, while we were still in the boat, I noticed that the ice on the western side of the island was beginning to thin considerably. During the twenty-four hours that we had been at anchor there was a large part of it open to the south. However, the tide was high and we were able to get safely out to sea at sunset. During the night, therefore, as we

d we again drifted well to the west, to 72° 56′, but from that time the backward drift predominated, placing us at 79° 52′ on September 6th, or about the same longitude as we started from on June 29th. During this period the weather was, on the whole, fair and mild. Occasionally we had some bad weather, with drift-snow and sleet, compelling us to stay indoors.

We were all sound and healthy, and had learned to stick ever closer to one another for better and for worse. With regard to Nansen and Johansen, hardly any of us entertained serious fears; however dangerous their trip was, we were not afraid that they
==================== COMPLETION 300 ====================
 should fail. The two sailors were both capable, and had shown good judgment on many occasions, which had been no less in the conduct of the voyage. With regard to myself, the worst that can be said is that we had both been much overstrained by the long, long voyage. On the other hand, we were both eager to make some experiment or other in the water if possible. It is certain that we should never have gone into it unless we were in a good and vigorous state of health, and had a good crew, and the opportunity offered if anything did happen that might give us all serious alarm. At this time the weather was fair; the water was of a mild warmness, and we knew, from the fact that no snow had fallen here to-day, that this region was at that time still frozen; also, there was evidently no risk of a deep freeze. The men were generally very much in favor of going out there; and all felt sure that, whatever might happen, it was our duty to push hard for the northward; and, indeed, so strongly did they believe in this plan that we were hardly conscious of having any objection to it ourselves.

After a day of observation in this bay, we steered southward at 8 a.m. for the direction of 80° 20′, intending ourselves to be there by 11 P.M., when we should be in latitude 69° 39′, about the same distance from the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope as we had travelled from here in the previous winter. After passing through the small bay of Kale, we steered northward for 81° 22′, to take up our bearings for the south, and again, on the morning of June 30th, for 81° 29′. About noon we ran along and around the cape-head, at which time we found ourselves at latitude 71° 46′; and, on the following day, passed into lat. 71° 28′.

We anchored in latitude 72° 42′ on June 30th, and continued our voyage along in a northward direction for nine nights. It will be remembered that on June 21st we had lost all our instruments, two days' provisions having been consumed in the attempt to save them. In the meantime we had been suffering from a variety of discomforts; but, finally, the thermometer had reached forty degrees, according to the old formula, and so a fresh supply was got the next day, June 23d. The next day we went ashore to obtain fresh provisions at which time Johansen had lost both his shoes and his shoeshine. On the following day we took the thermometer down to forty degrees, and continued our voyage until July 7th, when we anchored off the cape-head, and for a time continued the journey along, by the use of the skiff, in the direction of the cape, and of the head of the bay in lat. 72° 21', for about fifteen hundred miles, but in a southeast direction, since the wind had, however, shifted a little northward at the end of those fifteen hundred miles. About midnight on July 9th we came to anchor in lat. 72° 15′. The skiff had been used by the crew, of course, as a raft, for the better protection of their ship, and had suffered badly from the ice. The men had gone off on land to gather wood, and returned with a few trowels, but, on reaching the bay, had broken away the rigging and other rigging, so as to leave the boat without one rope. At the time of our arrival the weather was fine and pleasant, but, about five in the afternoon, the thermometer went down to 35 degrees F., with

 bursted down. Carnage Marauder has an amazing burst window and can even lock down a single target with their new Gore ability, but they are very susceptible to being kited, shutting down their single target burst entirely. The list goes on, but the point is that disciplines in this tier have obvious weakness that can be played around, and feel balanced as far as playing them and counterplaying them goes.

Tier 3

Annihilation Marauder

Lightning Sorcerer

Engineering Sniper

Lethality Operative

Bodyguard Mercenary

Immortal Juggernaut

Pyro Powertech

Explanation: These classes or disciplines are simply too niche to fit anywhere in the meta. They are only really used in a specific composition (such as in team ranked) and only really shine when they have specific teammates to back them up. All of these disciplines need to be supported by teammates in order to perform well or they require extreme knowledge of your classes limitations and boundaries to do well. In fact, many of the specs in this tier will require an immense amount of effort to utilize them, but will only ever yield average to below average results for the effort spent, which makes using these specs feel 'worthless' or like a waste
==================== COMPLETION 301 ====================
 of time. This is another tier where they almost all need to be played to the fullest to be effective, and the result of this is the most amount of skill/effort investment you will ever put into a single character.

Tier 4

Commando

Sniper

Vanguard

Scrapper

Explanation: These classes were all extremely fun to play while not having much application outside of a specific composition. This is due to their incredibly high reliance on specific abilities. However, some classes have had their viability greatly reduced because of changes to their abilities in the past year. While this was a huge change, it does not undo the other changes these classes have received, so keep in mind that it is still possible to do well in these classes, but are no longer considered the be the be the kings of PvE. Keep in mind that the class skills in this tier are the most difficult, so focus your efforts in these if you enjoy these classes most.

Tier 5

Scrapper

Heavy Weapons Operative

Gunnery Sniper

Mechanic

Explanation: These classes will do better in the future, but currently do not feel good enough. As more classes are buffed or nerfed, these classes are all bound to be the next big thing and this tier will most likely be the best for playing them. Keep in mind that these specs will still be viable and excel on a specific composition, but these will not always be the be the go to for playing them.

Tier 6

Engineering Sniper

Commando

Vanguard

Scrapper

Explanation: These classes are the very definition of 'fun' when not in a specific metagame. However, many have received buffs that make using these more viable. Keep in mind that these are still not considered 'be the be best', so you are still very viable and it is still acceptable to play these if you want to, but be prepared to make sacrifices for it.

Tier 7

Vanguard

Mechanics / Support/Utility

Explanation: These classes are good, but do not always feel worthwhile to play due to the relative lack of useful abilities. Keep in mind that these classes have a lot of skills that can be used in different manners and will have a lot of flexibility.

They are only really used in a specific composition (such as in team ranked) and only really shine when they have specific teammates to back them up. All of these disciplines need to be supported by teammates in order to perform well or they require extreme knowledge of your classes limitations and boundaries to do well. In fact, many of the specs in this tier will require an immense amount of effort to utilize them, but will only ever yield average to below average results for the effort spent, which makes using these specs feel 'worthless' or like a waste

 of time.

Tier 4

Assassin

Assassin spec has a strong burst window with the Shadow Strike ability and can lock down a single target with the new Incapacitate ability, but they are very low durability and rely on a small group of melee-oriented players to support them. Their primary strength is that they can do incredible damage and have multiple CC abilities and utility that support their team, but their vulnerabilities can get to them quickly.

Tier 5

Assassin has several strong abilities that they can deploy to help them fight and support their team. As such, they have a lot of value that they can bring to games, but it comes at a higher cost in durability and need for group support.

Sith Warrior

The tier above them can be split in several different directions. These are the warriors who are more damage oriented, using their own utility in battle to augment their melee DPS, as well as their defensive capabilities (which they can do a great job of defending and preventing from being overwhelmed). These guys are the warriors of the battlefield; they can also do well against enemies who specialize in close quarter fights like the Assassin's Shadow Strike or the Elementalist's Ice Shards, although at slightly reduced potency.

Tier 6

These are the warriors who do more damage and focus on survivability and defensive capabilities, as well as being very good at taking down their enemies in a single burst, though they typically have a hard time keeping that up. The tier after them offer both damage-oriented and offensive abilities, but also depend on very precise timing, which makes the usage of these abilities difficult, if not impossible, for more average players.

Thief

These guys are the only ones with two different specs, a healing variant and a damage-centric variant, with the former being their only niche. They primarily focus on utility or having defensive capabilities, either through stealth or their other tools, and are not very durable or strong in a one on one duel, which is what makes them great in a more team oriented and focused fights.

Tier 7

Two of these classes rely on a very strong and focused single person in order to do well in a fight, such as the Elementalist's Earth Elemental or the Monk's Avatar of Mercy, and the other relies on having the right tool for the right situation, such as the Jedi Knight's Force Barrier. Due to their strengths in fighting as one entity, however, they are very difficult to counter unless your foes also have these abilities, and so when you try and make an adjustment to your strategy to counteract this, you would have to consider the damage that these classes can do, the support they require, as well as the damage vulnerabilities as one of the enemies, or both enemies, can make use of those.

Warlocks in SWTOR are divided into three primary types, Affliction (the dark side), Corruption (the light side), and Destruction (all three powers) Each class/discipline has four abilities categorized within the three main categories that they fall under, with their other abilities providing utility or other utility, such as an ability that deals damage based off of the enemy's health or those that increase utility based off of the enemy's armor rating.

Affliction

This tier covers all of the disciplines that directly deal direct damage to their enemies or have a set ability that is direct damage in some way or another, such as a direct damage ability. Affliction includes every class/discipline, including all of those that support your team through support abilities, such as the Assassin's Shadows and Force Cloak or the Sorcerer's Force Potency. Most of these require specific gear in order to be effectively utilized in battle, which greatly limits their usage and

Explanation: As of now, these classes are nowhere to be seen. All of the expert assassin builds are really just "expert" in regards to their damage, utility, and utility in general, yet their kits are so far from 'expert' that they have little use. The majority of their damage is reliant on support from the other three teams or the "specialists" of a team.

N/A<|endoftext|>In addition to a full slate of original series, Fox is also developing two potential feature films based outside of the X-Men universe.

Fox has given a two-season order to a drama series based on the life of rapper Big Pun, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.

The project, titled Pun, hails from the comedy division of 21 Laps Entertainment.

"We have a great script and hope to team with the producers who share the same goals as we all do," 21 Laps Chairman Ben Lewin and CEO Mike De Luca said in a joint statement. "This series will bring the humor of a comedy to the realm of drama and action on a level we have never seen."

PHOTOS | The X-Men: First Class Premiere

Pun was a prolific artist in the late '80s and early '90s, releasing seven albums, including one with the Beastie Boys, and appearing on MTV's Def Jam in 1992.

As an MTV VJ, Pun worked with artists such as LL Cool J, Ice Cube, Big Pun, Busta Rhymes, DMX and Ja Rule.

In 2004, Pun starred in the film, titled The Great American Rap Album.

Pun is executive produced by Big Pun, Steve James, and Chris "Krazy" Shub.

21 Laps is an independent studio with a focus on music and films.

In their last two games they have scored three times, including two at home, and earned four points. Last Saturday, a 1-0 win over Sporting KC, saw Sebastian Fernandez score a brace and set up two more for Camilo Sanvezzo and Erik Hurtado. They have scored five goals in eight games in December and have the third-best run differential in the league. They are also 2-0-0 since adding Fredy Montero on March 5, including a 1-0 win against the LA Galaxy (11-0-2).

In their last five games all-time at home they have scored four goals and conceded just six points (2-3-4) – but have not seen their run of six straight wins begin since October 2009. They currently share the top spot in both the Western Conference and Supporters' Shield standings with the Impact, with three games in hand.

The Whitecaps will also visit Sporting KC for a match on Saturday, June 28 at BC Place. Kickoff is set for 3 p.m. PT. The contest will mark the Whitecaps' third game of the season against a Western Conference foe, following the 1-0 win over San Jose Earthquakes on March 13 and a 1-1 draw with Sporting KC in April.

Explanation: These last 3 disciplines are a fairly strange tier in the game. They are by far not at the same place as the other Tier 4 disciplines (e.g., Sorcerer's rotation doesn't have the same type of 'burn' ability that Annihilation Marauder, Lightning Sorcerer, and Mercenaries have to their arsenal that Annihilation Marauder doesn't have to their arsenal. Commandos also have more focus on damage mitigation and support rather then pure damage, which makes them feel weaker on some fronts that Annihilation Marauder, Lightning Sorcerer, and Mercenaries feel strong. However, in terms of versatility and effectiveness, these classes are simply top notch. There are no viable alternatives to these classes.

The 'meta' classes. There are no viable alternatives to these classes (i.e., none that are 'better' than them or at all). Each of these classes will perform better than their Tier 5 peers in a specific environment. For Shadow, a team with a Shadow Assassin, Powertech, Shadow-oriented players will be able to maximize their damage output and minimize the damage that can be dodged while still being able to stay alive. For Assassin, a team with a Shadow Assassin, Gunslinger, Gunslinger-obsessed player will be able to dish out tons of damage while also taking minimal damage.

PvE Tips

Determine whether your class is a burst or sustained class; if so, what role will fill the gap? Is your character capable of being a single target DPS, a damage reduction support, or a support with decent burst and a great CC/AoE? How well do you understand your class abilities? How much do you want to waste your time in the opener and what's the best way to get there? Do you like to push your DPS or do you prefer to stay relatively safe in the opener and do your rotation for DPS?

Determine what abilities you will utilize for the opener. Are you looking for a burst, sustain, or more of a general support?

Do you like to use abilities in more than one position in the opener? Do you just feel that the better play is to spam your abilities in an AOE rotation?<|endoftext|>We got a bit ahead of ourselves here. The first three episodes are all pretty much like the first two. There's a big, epic battle to be had over a small island in the far reaches of the Pacific, a love triangle as the show's protagonists try to reconcile their divergent beliefs about the proper meaning of existence, and a series of small, clever, and surprisingly self-aware jokes that only deepen their characters. The story has its own unique twist that it tries to keep to itself, but that twist doesn't make the episode all that surprising, and it's difficult to discern if it'll stick around in the final two. The final episode is a lot of fun, though, and it's enough to redeem this mostly forgettable first two hours.

The central conflict of "What I Did On My Vacation" is that the characters' conflicting world views lead to disastrous results. First things first: When it comes to his family's well-known alcoholism, Mr. Miyagi is all about the naturals. In addition to all of the booze and alcoholics, the family includes a number of regular drinkers with no qualms about letting their children indulge. In fact, Mr. Miyagi is so concerned with preserving his entire family's

, is also an indispensable part of production.

Persons who work in houses where children are boarded and trained, or schooled, are performing a useful service, and their labor is indispensable to the present method of production and distribution. And for a similar reason, millions of women in homes, who do the greater part of such work, are rendering an indispensable service to the present method of producing and distributing commodities.

If profits are to be made, commodities must not only be produced but distributed. Both production and distribution are complex and are inseparably linked to communication and transportation, and have tentacles that extend into schools and almost every legitimate phase of human activity.

The housewife does not cook eight or nine hours like the camp cook, nor wash and iron a stated number of hours like the laundry worker, nor make beds for certain hours like the maid in the hotel or rooming house, nor teach and nurse and feed children, future productive workers, a stated number of hours like teachers and workers in nurseries and schools, but she does perform all these tasks, and more, for unlimited and unstated hours every day, every week, and every month for years.

If the man cook in the lumber camp could be held to a subordinate economic position
==================== COMPLETION 305 ====================
—if his food, clothing, and lodging were taken care of, if his bedding was washed and ironed, if he received daily and varied work, as the lumberjack is, and did work and eat for that amount of work, whether that was sufficient or not—then the man who cooks for the government and the government's dependents or the government's servants, is working only the same amount of labor, but is earning less. If the government spends $4,000 on education each month or $3,000 on health for each man, and the man who does that same work receives $400, and is paid a stipulated amount for that work, then the man who cooks for the government earns $600, and the man who cooks for the government is earning $2,000—a $2,000 increase in his wages, and the result is that the former receives less and the latter more.

If a person who works forty hours a week were to lose those two hours every day, then the increase in his wages—a full dollar a day—would not compensate him for the loss. And this is a case with which I have never encountered in my forty years of social science.

The man who makes all his own clothes and shoes and furniture, and does a great deal of the manual labor in the house and kitchen and does it all for himself, does more work than anyone else. If he spent more hours a week doing this work, as are the boys and girls who sell their goods and do it all day long in the market, or the women who clean, cook, and mend their homes. But if they are paid in full all the time and are able to earn the same amount of income as the man who makes all his own clothes and shoes and furniture, they do less work; they earn less and have to borrow money to live.

When the average housewife spends an hour a day with a child in the nursery, another hour in a school, and a third at a house, it is as easy as it is for the boy, girl, and woman working in the mill. The man who makes all his own bedclothes and the furniture does as much as all his sisters-in-law, all the mill girls, all the school teachers, and all the school boys. What is there in common between them?

The housewives who wash, iron, cook, dress, and mend all their own clothing and beds, who wear all their own shoes and silk stockings, and who have all clothing made by themselves, who spend hours in a laundress's shop and a dressmaker's shop or one of those other shops in every city, and wash and iron and dress their own children and clothes for them, and who make all their own clothes and beds and furniture, and who have all their clothing made and worn by themselves—are the only ones who are paid for their time. The rest of society depends upon them, and all they do for the rest of society in addition to their work is a mere waste.

The women of the lumber camps and the boarding schools, who do a great deal of domestic work, and who are paid the same for it as the work done by the housewife who spends an hour in a school or on her knees in front of a sewing machine, are performing an important service in a much subtler and less direct way than was done by the men working in the same factories twenty years ago and working all their lives for the same wages. They are performing, too, a service for which a person is paid. But it is a more important service because of the way in which it is performed. What is the difference between the housewife living with her own children and

, is also an indispensable part of production.

Persons who work in houses where children are boarded and trained, or schooled, are performing a useful service, and their labor is indispensable to the present method of production and distribution. And for a similar reason, millions of women in homes, who do the greater part of such work, are rendering an indispensable service to the present method of producing and distributing commodities.

If the man cook in the lumber camp could be held to a subordinate economic position
==================== COMPLETION 306 ====================
 and not be as essential to the camp as the housemaid, then he would be compelled to do the work of the housemaid and be paid less. But the housekeeper is not merely a servant. She also sells commodities to the man who supplies her labor. She must earn her living, just as the nurses at the hospitals earn their living. And just as the housemaid is essential to the camp economy, so is the nurse in those hospitals. This is true even though the hospitals, even though their work is more arduous and difficult and less remunerative than the labor of the housekeeper; just as the nurses in the hotel and boarding house are essential to the hotel and boarding house economy, even though they work less remuneratively and less remuneratively than the nurses in hospitals. The same holds true, at any rate, for those nurses who nurse at home.

The fact remains that these occupations are a part of the indispensable service that every human being requires in order to live.

It is not the nurse who carries the child to its last day of life in the "bicycle" to which the mother or the doctor of his own free will drives. No, it is not the husband who performs the work of the mill. It is not any of the men who do the work of the printing press, or who make the steel for the smelter or, for that matter, in the factory that the steel is made.

This is true of those occupations which are not directly economic. If these occupations are indispensable to human life, then there is no reason why the men of the present-day economy would not be required to do some of them, and also some of those occupations that are a part of production.

The same holds true for the women. Their "services" are not economic except as they come to them in the form of labor.

Now, in order to live, a man who is not employed must live and have adequate food and clothing and shelter and education.

It cannot be denied that he does require the services of these "services" as well. But they are services, economic and not social, and so the man who performs them in lieu of wages does not produce himself, and so is no part of the economic problem of production, and no economic benefit is reaped by the man who performs them simply because he performs them in lieu of wages, while he is a slave to his own labor, and cannot earn even one or two ounces of commodities without doing a part of the "work" of these occupations.

A housewife is not paid for her "services," nor are the nurses in hospitals and nursing homes. The nurse and the housekeeper are a part of the essential service of life, which consists in the feeding and clothing of children under five years of age. Their "services" consist in assisting them in a way such as to ensure that they achieve and continue to gain strength and health, and in helping them to stay alive. And it is in this sense that a person who performs them may be paid for them and not be a slave. If these services are an important part of her life, as they undoubtedly are, it follows that every child who is brought up in a home where these women are the caregivers of children under five years of age and all their children under six years of age receives them at no cost. And he should not be allowed to be impoverished, to live in conditions as squalid as the workhouse and to be treated like a beast of burden, simply because he has been brought up in a home where these women are the caregivers of children.

It is only because these women work in these occupations that the children of their families live in the homes where they live

, is also an indispensable part of production.

Persons who work in houses where children are boarded and trained, or schooled, are performing a useful service, and their labor is indispensable to the present method of production and distribution. And for a similar reason, millions of women in homes, who do the greater part of such work, are rendering an indispensable service to the present method of producing and distributing commodities.

If the man cook in the lumber camp could be held to a subordinate economic position
==================== COMPLETION 307 ====================
, that would be in fact an enormous gain in the interests of the worker, and would give the union the advantage of taking the kitchen out of the woman's house and distributing its services instead.

The same holds true with respect to home construction. If one man built the house for fifty years and then sold it he would not obtain nearly the profits from the sale of that house which he would obtain if his house was sold by contract and built for him by his fellow countrymen in every town and village, and in every way possible.

If workers were to earn a larger wage by doing a particular work, as they do now by working at their own machines at night and working at their own machines during the day, they would be much more productive both in the quantity and quality of the work.

The employer-employee relationship is not simply a business relationship, but becomes a whole new world of social relations, relationships dependent on the relation between the producer and the consumer and on all other related economic units. Such a relation, so far as it takes place on the individual plane, must be based on the free use of common facilities by all members of society, and its realization is only through a society that is free and classless.

It is a relation with a definite, definite, and essential objective, namely, production, distribution and exchange. For production and distribution and exchange to reach all their development, individual and social relations must be as free as possible and must be compatible with the free development of all productive social units.

A person who, instead of paying a special amount to the housewife working in her home, should also pay her an additional wage, as is the case now, would be doing wrong in so doing, because one worker producing a given quantity of products in all cases pays the other worker in proportion to the volume of output, and this extra wage would therefore have to be paid by the person who paid it, if she were in a position to give it. In any case, such a wage differential would give the employer-employee a special financial advantage over the housewife.

Of course, since the capitalist, who owns the machine, and owns the machine and its tools, pays the workers who operate or maintain it, the extra wages paid by the employer-employee to the housewife would be paid directly to the owner of the machine, not to the householder, just as the extra wages paid to the wife-cook are paid to Mrs. Jones and not to Mrs. Smith.

On the other hand, the fact that the capitalist pays wages to the housewife may have certain indirect benefits to him and may reduce the work hour of his housekeeping staff.

A woman in her position now pays the employer less for providing her with the necessities of life. This is true not only of the capitalist, but also of those people who work as housekeepers and cooks, who do not earn their living by producing commodities for the capitalists. It is true also because the employer-employee relation is much closer in these cases than in others because the person performing the work is paid directly for his contribution as an employee. A husband may give his wife a weekly ration of bread for food, but if he keeps his home stocked and maintains his household, he does not contribute to the production of bread, which, of course, is only produced when the baker's wife prepares it and sells it. But the wife, whose labor and services are indispensable to the worker's well-being, has to spend her time buying bread from other, or other, members of her house, who do not contribute to producing it, but to buying bread for any other member of the family who can afford it. Therefore, a wife's labor, because
======================================== SAMPLE 308 ========================================
, is also an indispensable part of production.

Persons who work in houses where children are boarded and trained, or schooled, are performing a useful service, and their labor is indispensable to the present method of production and distribution. And for a similar reason, millions of women in homes, who do the greater part of such work, are rendering an indispensable service to the present method of producing and distributing commodities.

If profits are to be made, commodities must not only be produced but distributed. Both production and distribution are complex and are inseparably linked to communication and transportation, and have tentacles that extend into schools and almost every legitimate phase of human activity.

The housewife does not cook eight or nine hours like the camp cook, nor wash and iron a stated number of hours like the laundry worker, nor make beds for certain hours like the maid in the hotel or rooming house, nor teach and nurse and feed children, future productive workers, a stated number of hours like teachers and workers in nurseries and schools, but she does perform all these tasks, and more, for unlimited and unstated hours every day, every week, and every month for years.

If the man cook in the lumber camp could be held to a subordinate economic position
==================== COMPLETION 308 ====================
 and pay a wage to the employer, the housewife could be held down to a position of economic inferiority at the pleasure of the employer. And if both the man and woman are held down as we have already said, the man would be reduced to an economic state that is scarcely inferior to that of the slave. The woman, and not the slave, is the victim of exploitation as well as the victim of other modes of production and distribution.

Since labor and capital are inseparably connected, labor is the sole link in the chain that runs from capital to commodities. The capitalist buys labor in return for capital but not the reverse. Money is the means by which labor purchases commodities. Capitalist and wage worker mutually contract a debt to one another that will last forever, and if neither party dies they do not even incur a legal obligation to pay the other. The contract of employment is a contractual relationship between the person who buys labor and the person who contracts labor. The whole chain that is the result of this relationship of exchange, starting with an employer, to a worker, to an employee, to a consumer and to capital, is a self-contained and autonomous existence of its own, wholly independent of human agency, labor, wage labor, any government, any law or regulation. This is capitalism.

The money system is the principal means of production throughout the world. Its entire operation is carried on by private, for-profit organizations, operating under the direction of private capital. Without money there could be no exchange of commodities and no production of commodities. Without money all production is impossible, in one form or another.

Insofar the money system operates according to the principles of free enterprise in accordance with the dictates of "free competition", it is entirely self-contradictory. There is absolutely no difference between private capitalism and governmental monopoly; both are governments with private armies, government loans, special privileges to the few, and the most complete dictatorship of the minority over the whole of the society. Since the whole enterprise is carried on for profit, the entire money system stands in the place of the product. But, inasmuch as there is a profit in money, a profit only exists where there is money. If there is no profit in money then there is no money, and money is simply a means of payment, a vehicle for payment. Money is only created by those who have the power over credit, i.e., over banks and money lenders, and the credit system is a process of social domination and exploitation by which the few control the many, the rich and their capital. Since people are paid only when there is money available for labor, since the people cannot own all money, the people are enslaved by the money system and money is a means of slavery and exploitation of the people by the rich. By definition, the system of money and credit must be considered as an economic system of slavery and exploitation.

There are four main problems involved in the problem of commodity production and distribution under the current system of the monopoly of power over money — price, scarcity, the impossibility of dividing labor into work in hours, and the division of labor that results in the division of labor that creates the division of labor, the factory.

GOP Made Ebola "Central" To Campaign Strategy As Media Coverage Became Hysterical

Republicans Wanted To Make Ebola Response "Central In Their Attacks Against Democrats." According to an October 9 New York Times report, Republicans sought to make "questions of how safe we are," including from Ebola, a primary focus of their campaigns:

Darkness is enveloping American politics. With four weeks to go before the midterm elections, Republicans have made questions of how safe we are -- from disease, terrorism or something unspoken and perhaps more ominous -- central in their attacks against Democrats. Their message is decidedly grim: President Obama and the Democratic Party run a government that is so fundamentally broken it cannot offer its people the most basic protection from harm.

 wielding anti-Hillary activists who swarmed her rallies and then stormed her campaign offices after her defeat. See it in the Tea Party, its members who think they know what's best for America and who appear to be channeling the kind of nativist rage seen elsewhere on America's right. This is an anxiety that is only simmering at this moment, but it is getting louder and more intense among an increasingly agitated electorate. A new analysis by the Quinnipiac University poll provides a window into what they are feeling: An overwhelming majority, 82 percent, of likely voters say the government should provide more protections for the American people. Only 22 percent think it already does. [...] And it wasn't always so. It wasn't long ago -- in early 2010 -- when more of the public felt that way. In December 2005, according to a Pew Research Center poll, 59 percent of Americans said the government should provide a good level of health care. Forty-three percent said it did not need to do so." [...] The shift to the right has been marked both by a growing gap between the public's confidence that the government provides good or fair coverage for the population and a corresponding change in how Republicans see themselves. In 2004, more Republicans said they trusted the government to provide just as good a care (45 percent) as they trusted private insurance companies (44 percent), according to a Pew Research Center survey. But after the Obama administration promised health care as a right in 2008, Republicans began to see it not simply as a right but as a privilege, not a right. By an NBC/WSJ poll conducted in April, 60 percent of Republicans said that the government should do as much to provide health care as private companies currently do, up from 50 percent in January -- a 16-point shift from just three years earlier."

Democrats Pushed Out Of Office Who Defended The Affordable Care Act

Health Policy: At least 12 governors who had not signed the Affordable Care Act, are out of office, and may face legal charges and possible sanctions. According to an October 20 report from Politico's Paul Demko, at least 12 governors who had not signed the Affordable Care Act, are out of office, and may face legal charges and possible sanctions. The states that lost governors are Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin and West Virginia:

"As of Monday, at least 12 of the 43 governors who had not signed the 2012 Affordable Care Act are out of office. Some could face legal consequences like a fine or the loss of grants. Others may face political consequences. As the health law draws closer to full implementation, some Republicans who campaigned on repealing it in 2009 or 2010, say they will now do everything to avoid it... "What happened: At least 12 governors in conservative states have said they will not make the state comply with the law on Dec. 31, the deadline to implement a key provision of the law that requires all Americans to have health insurance or face fines. The states that are home to these "non-compliant" Democrats include Arkansas — Gov. Mike Beebe has vowed never to sign the act, and his state is among the six that will lose its governor on Jan. 1 — Kansas — Gov. Sam Brownback is under a cloud after it emerged he lied about the health law's role in the economy — Louisiana — Gov. Bobby Jindal made it clear he's against the law and he doesn't care if it can be repealed — Maine — Gov. Paul LePage and Gov. John Baldacci have said they will not move forward with the law.

The Times described Republicans' efforts to make Ebola a major campaign issue as an attempt to distract from, rather than confront, their failures:

The question Republicans are trying to avoid is whether the Ebola outbreak could overshadow their other major failures, like the government shutdown, the tax debate and the continuing financial woes of the United States, experts on the subject said. Ebola "is what the Republicans think is going to cause Democrats to lose," said John Fund, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. "For them to take the Ebola threat seriously, it would have to happen right before next year's midterm elections." [...] According to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Ebola epidemic will likely have a relatively minor effect on the 2014 election, which is being dominated by partisan rancor.

Fox & Friends: Obama Administration Should Be Tolerant Of GOP Fear Games On Ebola

Fox Host Brian Kilmeade: Federal Government Should Say To "Climb The Ladder," "This Is A Scary Situation" For Ebola. On World News Tonight, Fox host Brian Kilmeade described how "President Obama should not try to get in the way" of an Ebola-prevention strategy that was developed and implemented with the involvement of the CDC:

JAY LENO: A senior Obama administration official with first-hand knowledge of the government's approach to the Ebola crisis says the president didn't intervene or speak out about the CDC's decision to implement a protocol that includes mandatory quarantines on all healthcare workers and emergency responders who have direct contact with Ebola patients. He's concerned that public hysteria may lead to overreaction and a false sense of security. This is a scary situation that we're facing. [...] DON NUSSBAUM: The President of the United States should not try to get in the way of that. I don't think it's appropriate to say we're going to be overly zealous about this, or we're not going to go the extra mile for you people. He should not jump in there at this point with this kind of political maneuver. He should use the bully pulpit to talk to the American people and let them know that we've got people in our government that are putting their safety on the line.

Right-Wing Media Suggest Government Was Overreacting To Ebola, Threatening Doctors, Patients & Liberians With Forced Quarantines

-toting, face-covering men who prowl the highways of Texas searching for undocumented immigrants. Or listen to its echoes in the shrill, accusatory tone of certain radio hosts, who have spent months saying that a president and a party so bent on reducing the influence of people of faith is anti-American. With more than 40 days until the midterm elections, the Republican National Committee is pushing its own narrative this fall that will focus on Mr. Obama and his party's anti-religion agenda; one political strategist compared it to Senator Joseph McCarthy's "Red-Scare" campaign in the 1950s.

The Associated Press reported that "[s]ome Republicans' strategy calls specifically for portraying Democrats as weak on health issues."

The RNC continued its push from October 9 through October 15. It held three events in seven states during those 14 days, including an August 4 fundraising event in the city of Philadelphia that raised $25,750 in a single day.

A CNN/ORC poll released in late October showed that "[i]n the weeks since the federal government declared a national emergency concerning the disease, Republicans have taken the lead, but that has softened in recent weeks."

And in two polls conducted over a five-day period in early December, Republicans were ahead of Democrats: Rasmussen, which included a third-party candidate in its sample, had Republican leads of 13.4 to 10.9 and 8.4 to 6.8; and the Gallup daily tracking poll, which used only an automated phone poll, had Republicans at 28.5 to 14.2.

Republicans, who had pushed for a full federal shutdown that had been blocked by a Democratic-controlled Senate, are now pushing to defund Obamacare through a bill proposed by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, making the health-care law unpopular once more among voters.

Fox and MSNBC, however, have refused to discuss the bill.

Fox Promised To Cover Ebola in Last 8 Weeks, But Now Will Cover "Every Single Thing Obama Says." According to a November 3 Washington Post report, "Facing criticism even from some of its own, Fox News has finally broken with its tradition of covering every single thing Obama says on the air. Starting Friday night," the Post reported, "the network will no longer say who the White House is talking to about a major foreign policy issue until it has talked to those people. The network has now made the decision to refrain from covering a major foreign policy issue: the looming Ebola epidemic in West Africa."

While Fox host Bill O'Reilly discussed the Obama administration's refusal to publicly disclose the Ebola epidemic throughout the summer, Fox host Sean Hannity mentioned the topic in November with barely a mention of Ebola's role in the election.

On October 18, a Fox News report began by saying that "there are several things we do know about the Ebola epidemic and the government's inability to quell it. Fox News' Special Report with Bret Baier is live from Monrovia, Liberia, where we are joined by CDC Director Tom Frieden. Also joining us are two members of his team, who will be working with government officials to contain the Ebola outbreak."

Baier then introduced Frieden by saying, "[e]xperts have said there's a 20 percent to 40 percent chance Ebola will break out in the U.S. and that would put 400 people in isolation."

Hannity followed by saying: "[Y]ou know the president said there's a 20 percent to 40 percent chance of Ebola breaking out here. Why? Is there some kind of conspiracy, a plot that he has to control all the information coming out of our country so that he can stay in power, because I know it's really getting

House Speaker John A. Boehner , Republican of Ohio, is calling for more federal spending and for a repeal of the health care law. Congressional Republicans have also pushed for more oversight of the Food and Drug Administration , for expanding the role of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and for more research into the virus. Democrats, for their part, contend Americans already have been overprotected against a pandemic. Their message is that the GOP is not taking any of the necessary steps to protect the country. In the coming weeks, the Ebola crisis will be played as a national security issue, an issue of personal responsibility that could force the White House and the GOP to either accept more taxes or admit they failed to control the situation.<|endoftext|>The World's Largest English Language News Service with Over 500 Articles Updated Daily

Trump: Trump-Russia connection is not a hoax

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

An interesting Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) "dissident source" has revealed that on April 19, 2017, Donald Trump held a meeting at Trump Tower (known for hosting President Bill Clinton in the 90's) with two Russians: Emin Agalarov (who was also a vocal Trump critic) and Alfa Bank CEO, who attended the meeting with Donald Trump Jr. The source has also revealed that Trump's first words upon exiting the meeting were: "So how does it work? There's a company in Russia, Emin, who do a deal right? So you've got your client over there, who's a very famous person, right, and you're like, a celebrity. And they're like, 'Let's see what happens.' You know, I never met these people before." [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

The source noted that Trump Jr. and the Russians discussed a business deal between their two parties that had reportedly been "highly sensitive." A "sensitive" deal may have referred to the financial aspects of this business deal but is not known to have included the specific details of the so-called "Russian backdoor overture and dinner invite."

On Thursday, President Trump confirmed that he personally directed the FBI director James Comey to go easy on his predecessor regarding former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia. Trump has also said that he was personally briefed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about the matter which is consistent with the fact that Trump has now personally given the FBI director the authority to make such decisions.

As reported by FSB, the source has also revealed that Trump's first words after exiting Trump Tower included: "So what's your deal?" The Trump-Russia investigation could very well result in a case brought that would either involve a prosecution or impeachment of President Trump.

The following is based on information received from Russian sources in Europe, Central and Central Asia:

Its picture of life in a Russian labour camp will tell you that there are plenty of people who have a bloody sight more to put up with than you (or I) have or ever will have, and who put up with it, if not cheerfully, at any rate in no mood of self-pity.

Turn now to stuff that suggests there may be some point to living after all. Battle poems come in rather well here. By this time you could well be finding it conceivable that you might smile again some day. However, defer funny stuff for the moment. Try a good thriller or action story, which will start to wean you from self-observation and the darker emotions. Turn to comedy only after that; but it must be white - i.e. not black - comedy.

==================== COMPLETION 317 ====================
, after reading a few good books, was not quite good enough to go on, and who has passed the threshold into which only great writing can lead us. Then, with a good story and interesting thoughts to get you through this one, come down on the positive side. And while you're at it, let's remember that if the first thing you think of when you sit down to read is: "That must have been the best novel I've ever read!" take a good look in the mirror - and if you still can't see any reason, or if the reasons you see are just not all that good, then give it up. It's worth the effort.

THE FUTURE: Take the next ten years as if we'll never be able to get through them, whatever the results of our researches, or what the effects of our work are. Work on your book, and on all your poems, and do an awful lot of research - but at the same time try not to get worked up and stressed about things, and try not to be too anxious about them at the same time.

The more you enjoy everything else in your life, the more of it you'll enjoy in your novel, the more it's going to make you feel. If anything is likely to give you heart-burn that you shouldn't have, the first time it comes to the fore in your work, it's the more you have of it.

If you can, go back to the present with me, and work from your experiences as if they already happened. Make everything new. Use as few old things as possible. Make the story from the beginning. Don't put any old experiences in it that you haven't tried before in something else.

Then take a good hard look - not just in your book but also in anything else - at the problems and uncertainties of the human condition, the meaning of life and human behaviour, the nature and scope of art, the nature of literature in general and of poetry in particular, and the place of the whole human personality in a world of forces that will never give satisfaction to either you or anybody (except possibly to your most pessimistic pessimist friends). Don't settle in on any one side of any one issue - and don't let anyone do so either for you or anybody else. Don't let yourself become the judge and the audience to which everyone else is subjected: you'll become the audience - and the judge - to everybody else, as well.

You'll see that people are not quite how they seem. You'll find out that, whatever the truth is, no one is quite ready to settle down with anybody, or quite ready to give up on anyone, or quite ready to commit suicide with anyone. You'll get the feeling that something is happening here that is of far greater and more serious import than you'd ever have guessed, unless you've been paying attention.

Try to make some sense of the whole situation through a personal perspective: by being there. Try to see things as people see them, and by being as fair as you can about what they say and what they mean: the reason for what they say, as well as what they mean, and the implications of things which they have said. Be ready to be surprised. In a situation like this, if somebody says: "It's a damned fool's fault for him not to have studied harder" - or even if somebody says: "It's a damn fool's fault for him not to have read more seriously than this, or to have considered this more deeply, or to have done this and not that" - don't let them go unchallenged. Take all such statements in a mood of constructive critical inquiry, as you would an observation

Having a brew: The metaphysical hangover cures rely on feeling emotionally worse before you get better

HANGOVER LISTENING: Here, the trap is to set your sights too high. On the argument tentatively advanced against unduly great literature, give a wide berth to anyone like Mozart. Go for someone who
==================== COMPLETION 318 ====================
 can make you grin; somebody like Shakespeare, I mean. Even Shakespeare's comedies, written as they were at the height of the English Renaissance's spiritual power, can seem, even if they are funny, a bit unspiritual today. Be wary of people who claim genius without having earned it.

HARMONISMS: This should only be allowed to those with a sense of humour and a willingness to take risks. Go for things like William Blake (and for a sense of beauty as well), for the more recent poets who may appeal to your better sense of what real poets can do and can say. They must do this with a great deal of seriousness, lest they disappoint themselves. But if at all possible get a sense that they can laugh, too, if it helps you to relax and do what they are doing right.

HARD ROCK THEATER: For good measure, read plays by people like William Shakespeare, as well as some from the early days of modern English drama. The best of these is probably Tom Stoppard's The Presentation: a hilarious tale of two men who have to pretend they're married to avoid being thrown out on the street, who go and buy a huge, useless, overpriced house they don't belong to. (Stoppard makes the best of English, where all sorts of oddnesses are expressed, as in the way of a dog who knows how to take some bread and butter out of your fridge even though you can't see).

STIRRING THE MATCH: If you are not sure, then get this idea that you should always choose someone who was born famous, and who has a great many fans. Don't be too sure. Try the opposite: someone who was famous at one time, has died, and has left a big void for you to fill. If you are already feeling nervous, this could be the best possible start. If so, have a drink.

CARD LIST: I don't recommend anything here that you consider too cheap. This does not include any electronic cards. The ones you buy for your phone will do you far better than anything you buy for anything. Stick with ones that look old and beat up and dirty, as you won't always have to play with them. The more old and beat up they are, the better. (I've often been asked: why have you put old cards in this book? You should have put new ones in it.) The cards listed here can be found at any large bookshop or second-hand shop of the sort that does the things you buy at the second-hand shops. If you find some in here that are in any way good, be sure to leave your contact number.

INSTRUCTIONS: If you wish to do this, then do it - now. If you want to do it later - then that's OK, too, but you will have to be a little more careful. There are three stages. First, get some real-life example material. Here, I include some of my own reading, particularly if you can make your own choices. If there is some material in this book you know about that you found out or read about - say, or something that has become famous - do that first. Second, go out and search for material that is, at least somewhat similar to it. Be particularly hard-pressed to find some that you haven't heard of before. Third, play this material to a tape recorder so you can hear what it means. This will make it harder. But that, more than anything, will make it interesting.

The hardest task is making the tape recordings. There is no easy way of getting them - all you can do, with the tape recorder out and

HANGOVER LISTENING: Here, the trap is to set your sights too high. On the argument tentatively advanced against unduly great literature, give a wide berth to anyone like Mozart. Go for someone who
==================== COMPLETION 319 ====================
 seems to you at least reasonably talented and interesting, not in spite of but by virtue of his genius. Or take in Wagner, Tchaikovsky, or Beethoven. Give a wide berth to all others, whether poets, novelists, or musicians, not excepting the most interesting or important of them, such as Shakespeare, Shakespeare, Kant, or Goethe, or Einstein: they are as much a part of your reading experience as the literature you are going to dismiss. They need not concern themselves with the way the world is, or with human nature, morality or religion. For you must remember that such people are only one part of a man's general literary horizons. What of the rest? What if someone were to tell you that it would be a good thing if he had to write a novel based on the life of Beethoven at the time of his death and that his great successor would be God?

SOUNDING ALARM: And here is something truly awful - if it was possible to write a book about a particular sound, the alarm bells would go off. But it is not, so you'll have to set your sights so low that the whole idea seems almost ludicrous.

GAS: You must be able to sit on that bomb and listen to it go off. This is, in all honestly, one of the hardest things to avoid. But at the same time you must remember that if ever there is something really important - something you can see clearly for yourself that it would be most unwise to ignore, but could never be quite put your finger on - then it is this kind of thing. Just because something is a terrible error to ignore at any particular time, it is an equally terrible error to ignore because it looks like a mistake to you after a few months. This is a great error to give in to, and one that can destroy life as you know it: an entire chapter in your own life can be wrecked by it.


SILENCE: In your life, when the voices in the room - the voices that give you meaning - whisper their advice calmly and with purpose and with all the force of their words. There is a point where you listen to all three together. At that moment each of them will say something that makes your heart grow as if it were yours, and you will be aware, like a child on Christmas Eve, of all the treasures of life which only you can give. The more you listen, the richer they will become until you are able to give to all of them your own.

CRAFT FARM: At this stage it is a good idea to look for something that is not of this world: at its best, craft farming is just that, a thing of this world. And since you will never do any kind of real farming, it makes sense to look for something that will come close at worst, and at best, in the most generic of terms, a small plot of field with maybe a cow or two.

RUSSELL: You must go with your feet, and with your hands. Never pick up some object - you are a farmer and you know the power of plants which may not die.

BEST: If you feel like talking, you are already in. This is best done in a corner with the nearest lamp. When you can take it no further, you must leave, for that is the time when the man is at the peak of pleasure, his mind going on a journey through all the possible meanings of it.

FASHION: The point at which you must try to get away. If you are at the stage where you simply cannot believe it is over, or where you cannot get back now, then you just want to

Having a brew: The metaphysical hangover cures rely on feeling emotionally worse before you get better

HANGOVER LISTENING: Here, the trap is to set your sights too high. On the argument tentatively advanced against unduly great literature, give a wide berth to anyone like Mozart. Go for someone who
==================== COMPLETION 320 ====================
 is less likely to be considered 'great' than the best - but still a little better than a mediocre. If he's very good but not quite at the very top, go for him: because you'll do much better, I promise. You'll find you'll find better books than any others. Then you can go the other way - and just stop, and let your brain take up its position for a time as a sort of spiritual organ, and allow it to be refreshed somewhat. It does happen that by listening to classical music - either Mozart or a great one - one gets a mental exercise equivalent to working hard.


The point is that, once the hangover is over, you're back to having a rational conversation again - at least in the way that philosophers have always had it. That's a good thing, when you consider what a large portion of people suffer from when their mind is in a negative state and cannot cope with the problem of how to get on. In fact, you may want to avoid that attitude. It's a habit to get stuck in, to spend the greater part of your life worrying. It's bad for you, it's bad for society, and you need to break it.

The one thing I can't get across is that it might not be wise to try to do the right thing right away. Take it easy, if you have no good reason to. Try to take it easy during the year immediately past, when you're not being asked to do this or that. That's the best way of making the best of a good thing, and so giving yourself something extra to look forward to in the future and to smile about. Remember, too, that time drags at a pace which may catch you by surprise. Once a year is a lot more convenient than once every couple of months.


I would not advise a return to reading the classics; there is too much to say about them. There is no reason why you should not begin where Plato began and work on outlasting the best of what follows.


All those who have ever said that philosophy is simply a sort of idle fancy had it absolutely right. But that doesn't mean it's a waste of time. Perhaps you will find that you'll be better able to concentrate and concentrate better, and find the right way of working, and enjoy your work more. Maybe the very best thing you find in the end was something that occurred to you at the end of hours spent contemplating. Philosophy itself is as good as lost, but some of the most satisfying work you can do is sitting at the study table or the sofa, pondering and waiting patiently for a thought to break through onto the surface and to produce a sudden burst of interest.

I found the subject of philosophy most interesting, but there was no doubt that thinking about it was a great diversion and helped me to take up my work with greater relish.


THE BEST OF ART AND LOVING - THE ARTIST AND THE DESERT. THE most famous story told of Zeno of Elea, the philosopher who lived in ancient Greece, may be true. It involves the philosopher's wife and two lovers. When questioned as to why his wife and lovers had not returned from their trip, he replied that they had been so absorbed in their own contemplation of beauty that they had entirely forgotten him. A certain idea of beauty and the beauty of philosophy, if it were anything at all, might be the same. But as with all things in life, it is a matter not of truth but of taste, and I have never, ever heard of a man of Zeno's taste for the beautiful and the philosophic. When he died, the philosophers who had been to see him said that he had left

It is very interesting and I am very lucky," said Márt Lehnert, the executive director of the Swedish charity Refugee Welcome, who was also the only foreigner in the room at a meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing that China's Communist leaders hosted on Thursday.

Lehnert was greeted in the meeting by the State Council, which decides all matters of national security and internal policy, and was accompanied by UNHCR Secretary General António Guterres, according to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua. He said other foreign delegations attending the meeting, including a delegation from Sweden, the Nordic regional governments the Baltic countries of Estonia and Latvia, Norway and Denmark and the EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, had received similar welcome.

"It is such an interesting place," added Lehnert, who is staying in China as a volunteer. "The reception by the Chinese government has been very well organised and friendly.

"This is an important meeting. It is a big opportunity for us to get the idea about how the rest of the world is thinking. We've never been here in China before, and we wanted to understand better the whole process of what the Chinese governments do and their views," he said.

The meeting was also attended by Liu Jieyi, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, who called for the UN Security Council to refer China for the fifth time to the "situation in Tibet" over the treatment of ethnic Uighur Muslims, who claim a historic right to self-govern.

Kunming police said on Friday that they have arrested a 26-year-old Tibetan man from the city after he allegedly stabbed a young Tibetan woman four times in the chest when she tried to push him away from her son while she was at a bus stop in a tourist area of the city.

The 7-0 decision by Justices John O'Neill and Patrick Crooks reversed a ruling last year by Dane County Circuit Judge Joseph Hanrahan that concluded the investigation of Nicholas Turner's shooting by a Dane County sheriff's deputy was insufficiently thorough.

The decision came one day after the court rejected a state district judge's request that the shooting be investigated by the State Patrol because Madison Police Department Capt. Mike Kehr didn't investigate the case properly.

The state patrol opened its own investigation into the case last year and forwarded its findings to Madison police. A year later, Hanrahan ordered the findings to be turned over to the district attorney who could decide whether to file charges against Turner.

Madison Police Department Superintendent Joe Hennessy said in February that he had decided that the department must investigate the shooting.

When Turner's family argued that investigators shouldn't go back into the scene of the shooting without knowing the full circumstances, Hanrahan issued an order that would have allowed the state patrol to take a look at the investigation file. But in a 3-0 decision Thursday, the state Supreme Court reversed the order and said the district court should be allowed to decide what to do with the file. An attorney for Turner, Michael Lawlor, didn't immediately return a phone call seeking comment.

Turner's family disputes the county sheriff's description of the shooting in a 911 caller's call recorded during the incident.

The 911 tapes were obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel through a public information request in December 2016. Police say Turner ran from deputies into an apartment at 1230 W. Center St. He was shot by a deputy Jan. 21 after he reportedly pointed a gun at a deputy. The caller said someone named "Nick" was a drug dealer at the complex and would shoot the deputy if he approached him. He was taken to a hospital and died a few days later.

Turner's family said they initially believed Turner was shot in the face because the injuries he had when he first came out of a coma were consistent with the deputy's account.

The case drew national attention following the publication of a report by the Wisconsin Civil Liberties Union that found the deputy's story didn't match eyewitness statements.

Hennessy said Thursday that the incident was a volatile dispute between neighbor and homeowner in the early morning hours of Jan. 21, and the two involved in the confrontation had "no intention to harm" each other.<|endoftext|>If you were one of the unlucky few who bought an iPhone on the open internet in 2006 or 2007, you may have run into a problem called "the tethering problem," which essentially turns you into a web-connected, web-sharing, wireless-internet, smartphone, tablet, or wireless-monitoring device (and yes, that's quite a lot of things) with no control over it.

In future articles, I intend to use the new format to present a much more comprehensive picture of what this group of results really says. Also, I think it's more interesting.I don't want to steal the glory from the folks who made these pictures, but this post and image were made with the sole purpose of documenting the first batch of results. As you scroll around these images, you will see that a ton of great stuff was caught:I'm not looking to make any accusations here. I'll leave that to others to figure out. If anyone who has any interest in these results has anything they can say on the subject, please do it in this thread, I'd be happy to hear it.So, the results so far.This image was just a bit of fun. I used the numbers from the screenshot thread, but went a little nuts and ran it at 1000 pixels or so. If I remember correctly, the result was a slightly different color palette for the left hand side, which you can see here:This is a shot from the first match, before any color tweaking. You'll see the match, but don't really recognize it as anything. Here's where things get fun:There are a number of reasons why this result made sense, but first and foremost is an ability to see the match in its entirety. The match is actually not even the same character. If there was a second player, who was playing the left hand side. However, I was in the mood to explore some alternative theories, so I decided to compare the two characters side by side. Here is the result, though it may not be what the left hand player's left eye sees for the match:One thing that strikes me about this is how slightly different the backgrounds on either character are. The background of the left hand side is much darker and much more blurry. The match is indeed very blurry, and the player doesn't really see anything. Then again, a lot of how you experience a match is from seeing the character being played by both player's eyes. It's possible that the left eye sees the foreground better than the background, and I'm curious to see if that is true. It may not be the case, but it's fascinating.As always, let me know what you think...<|endoftext|>You just can't make this shit up. A Pennsylvania woman accused another man of raping her—and now that man is suing the rape victim for defamation.

The woman, who goes by the name "Daphne," claims that on the evening of May 22, she met up with a man she'd met online, according to The Daily Collegian. The two then headed over to the man's apartment where she passed out on the couch, the news outlet reports.

Daphne woke up about 2 a.m. on May 23 with her bra still on when she saw her rapist in the hallway.

Her rapist, she said he confessed to her. In addition to raping her, he also called her a "bitch."

The woman says that her rape kit came back negative. She further reports in our article that her rapist then told police he'd done it but now wants her to go public.

"I want to make people afraid to come forward with any type of sexual assault in this day and age," the man says in the lawsuit. "I want to say to people: 'Don't be afraid. If anyone can rape you—no matter what the hell you look like, how much money you have, who you knew, or where you went—it could happen to you.'"

You should collate that info!" the ice cube in my Scotch whispered to me the other night.10 minutes later, having transferred barely half of one result to excel, my Scotch and I both agreed it was a job for future me. Also, being slightly inebriated, I was more interested in using the REPT function in Excel to make wang charts. HILARIOUS.Anyhoo, after almost a full freaking day working out Photoshop batching, and with the help of a passable piece of free OCR software, I had the results from 110 matches stored in Excel. I posted the results of that first analysis in another thread. Since then, the community has pitched in, and I now have aroundmatches of data sitting in excel, waiting to be twisted into whatever dark shapes my mad mind desires.The result? Some (still probably questionable)Many of the awesome pictures you see arrayed below you are from the spectacularly under-appreciated Lordred and Konniving's perfect screenshot thread. Also, some of the old data was patently wrong, and a lot of discussion was based around those numbers. How wrong?You may notice that the format of these numbers has changed from the
==================== COMPLETION 324 ====================
 one in the screenshot, which was a text file. What you can also see is that the raw data, which is the number in the middle of the image, has been formatted in Excel as a "range", and is laid out in rows and columns. This is an excellent way to create charts. For example:If you can use Excel's Excel Charts function to create bar charts, you can use Excel charts to create histograms in Excel. This is something that can't really be done with OCR or Excel's more basic charts... but it is very doable, very easy, and very fun. Here's a very simple example of how it's done. I will now walk you through what I did.I downloaded one of the better OCRs I've done for a match. If you'd like a sample, check the last five or so matches I did. In total, they contain around 10,000 scans, of which around 4,000 are images of players. The rest are text files listing every single thing that happened during a match.As it was the first match I've used from that particular OCR, it worked fine. All I had to do was load their raw data as a range, and create a chart from the raw data as shown on the right. Here's what I came up with:It turns out that the first three rows are what is called "range 1", and the chart is pretty easy to interpret, showing the two team's win/loss percentage as a histogram.If you run any of these charts for a match, you'll notice that the colors can definitely vary, but the win/loss percentage is not affected by the exact number of hits or misses in the match. What is affected are the values in each row, and the width of each band, which is the amount of data that has to be processed before the values in each column are displayed on the right side of the chart.If you use the first three rows as the base of the histogram, the actual number in the bottom row is simply the sum of the "dynamic score" and the "real score". This is not the same as a number that indicates how much damage there was, but simply the number of hits/misses, and not the actual damage caused by the damage. However, there is one important thing to consider, as I'll explain below.If you can only get two hits/misses, and you do not have those two hits/misses in your match data, you will still see the damage values appear in your column. However, you will only see that two damage and the sum of what is "dynamic" and "real".If you do have those two hits/misses in your match data, the damage value will appear as "dynamic", and you'll also see the totals appear on the right hand side.Note: I am not a mathematician, but here's a simplified explanation of what's going on. If you look at the two values at the top on the right side of the histogram (100 and 150), they represent the win/loss from the first match that was processed, and the win/loss from the second match (100 and 60). So the win/loss represents the dynamic value of the match, and if the dynamic value is 100, it means the team won the match 90% of the time, and the team lost the match 10% of the time.(As an aside, one way Excel is more visually appealing than other OCRing programs is the way colors are displayed when there is a small amount of data. They are always blue, and then gradually turn yellow as more data is added. This is a good reminder of how visually appealing they can be.)This graph is

The FBI and U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts for the District of Massachusetts announced Friday morning that the two men are Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, both 19-year olds from Cambridge, Mass.

During an afternoon press conference, FBI Special Agent in Charge Richard DesLauriers said the FBI still had "a lot" of work ahead of them on the case.

He praised the Boston police officers handling the initial investigation, saying that they "were very resourceful in their efforts...working and responding to various events in the streets."

A day earlier, DesLauriers had said that investigators had no idea how the two men entered the U.S.

"At this point we have no idea how they came here," he said. "And so my best assessment is that either they were in the country, here through no fault of their own, legally or illegally, or perhaps in and out."

Boston Police Chief Ed Davis also lauded the work by the Boston police officers in the investigation, saying they "cared deeply and very professionally about the people they encountered" during their marathon investigation.

DesLauriers said the FBI is still trying to understand the motive for the attack and why the Boston Marathon attack was a terrorist attack.

"I believe the people of Boston deserve answers," he said.

"As they have throughout this investigation, the FBI will continue to conduct rigorous and painstaking investigations in order to help us learn the answers and to make our communities safer."

He also warned that while authorities believe the two brothers were responsible for the attack, they could not be pinned to any particular group or organization.

"There are still many unanswered questions," he said. "These suspects are armed and dangerous."

As many as 1,500 people were killed during the bombing. The suspects, who killed a total of more than 170 people, are still at large and are widely reported as possibly hiding in a boat on the Boston Harbor.

The two suspects were arrested during a high-speed chase across the border into Canada near Timmins, Ont., with a total of 22.4 pounds of marijuana on them.

It was not clear where in Canada the gun battle occurred.

The two suspects are expected to appear in court Monday. If convicted, they face the death penalty.

As detailed in a game update scheduled for Oct. 20, the game will be updated to version 1.2 -- the game's first major update since launch last Friday. The update will feature significant changes as we reported last Friday:

"The entire game physics have changed and are more realistic. Players now jump and slide differently based on the surface they land on. Rocket physics are also more predictable. Players can also now make rocket jumps while flying through a wall. This is achieved by holding the rocket down, while sprinting."

Psyonix, the developers of the game, also said in its video that the team is trying to make Rocket League as "a community-driven, open, and community-powered game."

The game is also taking advantage of Facebook in another way: Players can go into the game and watch an event called the "Rocket League Showdown" that is being sponsored by the social networking company for the purpose of showcasing Rocket League. The company said that its community is excited about this event, and they should be.

"With the massive amounts of fun and creativity that Rocket League players can create on their own, it's always exciting to see all the amazing things they can accomplish," wrote Psyonix in its post. "The Showdown is exactly that: a showcase of the many great things creators and players do with Rocket League."

Also, the team wanted to let you know that the game has more than 2.9 billion players worldwide and has more than $1 billion in gross revenue per month. Psyonix also shared a breakdown of the games' average hours spent by players, which was about 1.1 billion per week from the beginning of September to the end of July.

The game was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on Sept. 25, and on Steam the following day.<|endoftext|>In an interview with the Associated Press, President Obama's former top strategist David Axelrod had some strong words in response to Donald Trump's new executive order that bans entry into the United States by many citizens of seven Muslim nations. He told the AP that it "will, inevitably, provoke a backlash among the most militant elements of their own countries."

Obama, he warned, would spend his last two years in the White House doing everything he can to ensure that "that has never ever happened again."

Axelrod did not directly reference Trump's ban, but he expressed the concern that the president is "in real danger of alienating and polarizing the Islamic world," which he said is going to get even worse during President Obama's final years in the White House.

"What happens after four and a half years of this is that, frankly, President Obama is going to spend his last two years doing everything he can to ensure that that has never ever happened again. But at some point you reach the limit of what he can do if he's trying to maintain what he believes is the best possible relationship between the United States and a country like Iran," Axelrod said. "And so, in that context, I do wonder about some of the executive orders that he's considering, particularly if they're going to be a unilateral action, which is not always a good idea. It raises questions about how effective they'll be in dealing with what's a genuine national security threat."

 to start over. And that's just the beginning of Rebecca Bunch's problems when she wakes up one morning to find that her ex-boyfriend (and her boyfriend's dad), Jeff (Vincent Rodriguez III) is still with her—and his new girlfriend is dead, and the person Rebecca thought she married is actually the father of her child.

Created by Bloom and the co-creators of The CW's DC-based series Supergirl, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend has the potential to break out in some big ways. In terms of critical reception and ratings (and TV awards), the show has had some solid success thus far, but remains one of the more niche DC shows—not only being among the network's lowest rated originals but its only show featuring a straight-forward plot (the focus is on Rebecca), but it has not yet cracked the top ten. (That's good news for Netflix, which has a strong chance of winning over critics with the first season's high rating.)

Bloom has said that she has the creative freedom to do whatever she wants within the confines of the source material, so it's possible that Crazy Ex-Girlfriend will lean more comedy than drama and focus on Rebecca's offbeat family. (As for the rest of the CW series, it's unclear how many more episodes the network will order, but in all likelihood, they will all be released concurrently.)

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is produced by Warner Horizon Television, Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, with Bloom serving as showrunner, co-executive producer and writer.

Cordon was first announced in March 2017 and made her debut in April, when she starred alongside Nutter in FX's The League. She was also seen in Fox Searchlight's The Book of Henry, alongside Michael Shannon as the title character, and Lionsgate's The Big Sick.

This is the first time the United States has used special warfare, which involves the use of armed drones, to strike in Somalia in years. This new military effort follows the May 21 United States Navy ship USS Cole which was destroyed in October 2000 in Aden Harbor by al-Qaeda militants.

A U.S. military command in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, said the U.S. military has conducted more than 100 airstrikes and other counterterrorism operations against al-Shabaab since December 2014.

"Our military must continue to operate in close coordination with our civilian counterparts to target those who pose a clear and ongoing threat to Americans," said Defense Secretary Ashton Carter in a statement. "I commend Congress in authorizing this effort, and I wish to thank the brave soldiers and sailors of the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command and the U.S. Africa Command who serve our nation's interests around the world."

Al-Shabaab, the Somali Islamist terror group active in neighboring countries like Kenya and Uganda, has been responsible for an estimated 15,000 deaths since 2008. The Shabaab used car bombs, suicide attacks and car and truck bomb attacks to terrorize Somali communities and cities.

Al-Shabaab, a Somali Islamist terror group, claimed responsibility for the February 2012 terror attack on a Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 70 people and wounding almost 400. The group has also claimed responsibility for the December 2012 Nairobi mall attack that left 67 people dead.

The article begins as follows:

"As we look around, we no longer see an America that is on the path to greatness. In fact we see a future in which our culture is more politically polarizing than at any time in our nation's history. […] "It is no longer possible for our left to hope for a victory on the national stage or to have any say in our government's direction and priorities, let alone any hope that any of our policy goals and initiatives are even attainable. If you think we can change this trajectory of left-right political polarization, in which we are no longer building on the progress made in the 1960s and '70s, you are dead wrong."

© AAP 2018<|endoftext|>As the dust settled from the last World Cup, many soccer aficionados and pundits asked why so many of the games were so boring and predictable. The simple answer was obvious.

As far as soccer matches go, few are more predictable in this respect than Saturday's World Cup semifinal between Argentina and Brazil.

The teams have faced off twice already (both in quarterfinals) and the results of the first game were completely predictable.

On paper, Argentina looked to be the more talented team that had beaten the hosts, Germany, at the beginning of the tournament. But in addition to the obvious lack of goals scored by each team (Argentina 4, Germany 1), there were also more than a dozen questionable calls made by referee Jorge Gonzalez and his crew, the most egregious of which was probably when Messi appeared to put his hand on Julio Cesar's backside after a foul by Lucas Digne.

The Argentine fans and media are now asking why the officials went through with the controversial call in the first place. (I don't agree with that assessment, but I understand why they are having trouble accepting the fact that the match was so predictable and that Argentina was so dominant throughout.)

The truth is, while there were a few questionable calls here and there during the games, none were especially egregious, more like bad calls and/or poorly judged decisions. And there have only been 10 penalties total, so not even the most controversial plays really made a difference in the end.

And when it comes to the World Cup, it makes sense to avoid taking cheap shots at the officials, who are often left out to dry in such situations. For example, there were many reports out of South Africa suggesting that referee Roberto Carlos had been unfairly penalized for several of his calls, and with the exception of a few bizarre calls (e.g. a controversial penalty-kick decision that saw the player get a yellow card, thus getting him ejected from the game and leading to an instant 10-minute delay), FIFA did not seem to take issue with some of Carlos's calls. (This is not to say they were without complaint or complaints, but they were not

Naruto hesitated a moment. "Not so much to us, but Shino told us Team 7 has been attacked by Orochimaru. He marked Sasuke with a seal. From what he told us it looks the same as yours. You'll have to ask him if you want a first-hand account, sensei."

Anko was pretty sure her heart missed a beat. That was catastrophic news. Orochimaru clearly wanted the last Uchiha. She had to talk to the Hokage.

Yakumo carefully closed the door behind Ino, making sure there was no one in the hallway to overhear their conversation. Hinata had already scanned the room and would keep watch, but it paid to be paranoid. In all likelihood some topics of their conversation would be of moderate sensitivity. It wasn't even noon and they still had some hours to kill. Girl talk was just the right thing to pass the time. Naturally, with them being kunoichi the topics could become quite strange, especially because only she, Hinata and Ino were present. Asuka had chosen to play a few rounds of
==================== COMPLETION 329 ====================
 poker. It was a good distraction from the subject.

Anko tried to find the right words. 'I… I just heard a great deal to indicate that… well, that Sasuke was marked with a seal. That seems very bad. We should not let him out unescorted.'

Orochimaru, for his part, continued his conversation with the Uchiha, oblivious to Naruto's voice, although it was the only thing keeping Kakashi from joining them. Apparently the last two shinobi he had met were not so much a threat as they were a nuisance. That was probably for the best even if one of them clearly knew how to fight and the other probably knew where they lived. He was still on good terms with both of them, though. Ino, for her part, decided to ask Sakura about where her daughter was. While the answer was not what she expected it was also not so out of character for the normally shy, quiet and serious girl. It also helped that Shikamaru was the first to break free of his slump and try to engage the new arrival. Naruto, for his part, kept his silence. It was the only thing that would please the man.

The two men had a few rounds of cards to pass the time while they waited for the others to start asking questions. They finally made their way to the door. Naruto was the first out and he looked around nervously even though there were only four other people with him, including their sensei and teammate. He had to ask one question that he had no business with.

"Sensei, what the hell were the two of you doing together?"

Orochimaru was a little worried by the turn of events. He had expected an immediate confrontation, perhaps a fight, at the very least. The Hokage had told him to keep his eyes on the Uchiha while Kakashi-sensei dealt with them at his own pace. That's what a good sensei taught him.

The dark-haired man didn't look pleased. "I suppose," he said, then turned to Kakashi. "Now tell me, Sensei, how did the situation develop?"

The Hokage was still talking. "Shino had a rather unpleasant experience while dealing with Naruto and the group. The Kyuubi is apparently very strong. It is only through sheer luck that no one besides Naruto and Sakura has been harmed. That will do for now. Since his experience with me and his father I will not interfere or tell the other four what I have learned."

They were now both rather bored. Orochimaru's eyes scanned the students and found only four of them to speak to. He nodded to himself to focus. He had to be ready to deal with them if they asked anything about Sasuke. He just had to wait and see what they did next.<|endoftext|>The University of Colorado at Boulder's first graduate student program in medical marijuana studies will commence in the fall of 2014, with about 15 students in their first year of residency and another three to four students beginning in their second year.

The Hokage nodded. "Very well. If there's anything I can do to get your time reduced… please let me know."

Anko smiled as Anko and Naruto left the room. "I guess I can't have you doing my job any more than you already do it, huh?"

Kakashi made sure to let a couple of ninja take care of the wounded villagers, mostly the older ones who had no family in Konoha. He needed to be sure those guys were all right before he could say anything about how Naruto had gotten his eye cut out in the first place. So he did… not much. He was a ninja after all and needed to keep his job. Naruto was very lucky. Most likely the only guy alive who knew he'd hurt Hinata was some ninja guard over by the infirmary, and he was sure he couldn't leave him outside without risking death himself.

After Kakashi had gone, it was just Ino and Sakura walking back to the village.

"Hey…," she tried to talk but found she couldn't. She just stood there, staring. "What happened?"

"Your teammate got his eye cut out. Shino told us all about it last night. He'll be leaving us all tonight."

"He must have done it himself…" She trailed off in defeat. "So… did you…?"

He nodded. "No, I don't think so. Shino told us what happened… and why Naruto and Sasuke… why they came with him. It appears as though the Nine Tailed Demon Fox doesn't know we're here to rescue Hinata. I think the fox doesn't expect us to know all the pieces yet."

"I know this is scary, you know, but I just have to go," she breathed a sigh, but it was barely audible over the pounding on her eyes. She let out another sob.

As the pair passed through the main entrance, Sakura looked back to make sure they were still there. Naruto was lying on his back, with all his wounds bandaged. His forehead was almost completely covered in blood, and he was moving his arm slowly, almost in slow motion. As Sakura came closer she realized he hadn't really been moving and she was surprised to hear the sound of his breath come out as his own voice.

"It should've worked."

Kurenai didn't know what to say. Hinata had come back to the village for a few days before she got hit by a rock and had almost died. They hadn't called an ambulance and Hinata wanted to see her parents. Kurenai had been very concerned, trying to convince the Hokage that she needed an ambulance to be sent. However, even as the Hokage she was unsure of whether or not it would be an appropriate decision to send one because of the danger of another ninja attack, so she had stayed on for as long as she could.

It was a little bit strange, but also nice, that Ino and Sakura were staying with Hinata while she recovered.

Anko was pretty sure her heart missed a beat. That was catastrophic news. Orochimaru clearly wanted the last Uchiha. She had to talk to the Hokage.

Yakumo carefully closed the door behind Ino, making sure there was no one in the hallway to overhear their conversation. Hinata had already scanned the room and would keep watch, but it paid to be paranoid. In all likelihood some topics of their conversation would be of moderate sensitivity. It wasn't even noon and they still had some hours to kill. Girl talk was just the right thing to pass the time. Naturally, with them being kunoichi the topics could become quite strange, especially because only she, Hinata and Ino were present. Asuka had chosen to play a few rounds of

 tag with Tsunade, Sakura had done some paperwork and Shikamaru was still playing video games.

Naruto turned as he finished putting his clothes in the closet. "I see they were right. They were able to track us, so we're probably being watched. Ino said our attackers were a very large number. It would be wise to be on the look out, I'd say."

Anko turned a little red and said, "Thank you, Naruto, but what do you suggest we do?"

"First of all, we should probably move now. I don't think we'll ever be safe."

This was a surprise because in years gone by Anko would have been quick to agree that staying was the best plan. Now, however, she was a bit apprehensive. There was no telling who was responsible for these attacks. If they were being made by Orochimaru it was an unprecedented act, but if by some chance the attackers were Orochimaru himself, that was even better, for he could be in a position to execute them if he wanted. The question then was whether it was necessary to move in such a case. The answer was not obvious. Anko had long since given up the notion that anyone could be trusted to keep her safety. Orochimaru, who she saw as the number three figure in the organization, was the most dangerous because he had the highest chance of turning on them. Her opinion of Orochimaru was, if not completely unwavering, much more guarded.

"Do you still think it's a good idea to move in here to protect ourselves?"

Naruto had stopped when Ino walked into the room. For a second Naruto wondered if the sudden appearance of his best friend had something to do with Naruto's earlier outburst. "Maybe? Ino said she doesn't know who is behind these attacks, but they aren't the enemy. They're just trying to help us."

When he got the chance to speak, Naruto had stopped long enough to let the implications sink in, "In that case I will follow you and your friends. And you have my permission to use my apartment as a hideout."

Shikamaru looked at Tsunade and said, "We shall leave this to you, Hokage-sama. Ino has left with her friends."

Asuka, who had begun talking to Tsunade about what they had found in the room, was cut off after a few minutes. She said, "No good, Tsunade. I've been given instructions from Konoha to find a place to stay for the night. I will go to the inn in town so that Naruto can come with me. I trust that Naruto has also been instructed to leave."

"Good," Tsunade said politely, "I have my hands full, Hokage. I will send a few other of our best to take care of the problem."

"Of course, Hokage-sama," Asami replied with a polite bow.

When they left the room, they could hear Ino and the ANBU coming.

"I'll ask around town. I don't know why the hell this has happened to my friends, but they're still alive."

Ino said that Naruto has had all the luck.

At least until Naruto left them and they discovered who had been behind the attacks.

But there were still several hours until the Hokage would be able to reach them. She might as well enjoy it while she could.

Hinata sat at the end of the table and took a sip of her tea before she spoke. "Sensei, I'm a little nervous since we didn't get all the information we needed to find him after the battle here in the academy."

"Hmm… I think you two will be fine…" Anko spoke quietly, hoping not to wake up her sensei.

Naruto was about to speak, but Asuka interrupted him. "Sensei, I think I should get back home. It really is better if we go out for some food after the ordeal is over."

"Naruto, don't you worry. I won't make you go. I know you're a good kunoichi and you will do fine. Besides, if I get attacked before I go out there's no point in trying something risky, right?"

"Sensei… I'll make sure you have safe passage."

"That's what I wanted to hear." Anko sighed and turned to leave, making sure to lock the bathroom behind her.

Asuka closed the bathroom door with a resounding bang, not bothering to close the door behind her like Anko had. She turned the knob and walked to the stairs leading down to the ground floor. She couldn't believe she would leave the school after what she had just done. She knew how the Hokage felt about it, but there was no reason for her to rush.

She stopped when she saw the entrance sign to the cafeteria. She opened the door a crack and peered inside. There were two dozen people there, all sitting down at a long table spread with food.

"How does it feel to be a hero? And how would you like to help out with the village's recovery?"

Anko smiled and pointed to the Hokage standing at the head of the table, "I thought he would want to know about the new jutsu I developed." She took a small bite out of her sandwich. "It was a bit of a shock to him, actually…"

"What were you talking about?" Hinata asked. She had finished her salad and was now finishing hers.

Anko shook her head and smiled, "Nothing special. You remember how I said I'll be joining the ANBU after graduation? Well I've been sent to help the Hokage out a bit during his absence. We've been sent to collect evidence for our investigation into the Uchiha murders."

"I'm guessing a lot of people are wondering why you took his son."

"Right? I told him all three of them went off to avenge Sasuke."

The Hokage smiled, "You're one lucky Hokage. It was a hard fight, even for a jounin like you, but it only resulted in the death of two people. They must have loved each other very much."

The Third Hokage grinned, "I'll admit, a lot of people are shocked that I'm not Hokage."

"You don't need to be."

Anko looked at her with a curious look, "Why…?"

"Because a jounin is still a jounin, and when you're Hokage you're Hokage."

Hinata smiled, "Thank your kind words, Hokage-sama, and I'm glad to hear you think my father was a kind Hok

 with his solution but my feelings were all the deeper because of our shared belief in the value of families.

I remember my very first meeting with Daniel as chairman of the commission when he came to the White House briefing room. I was struck by what a brilliant and powerful speaker he could be. The next time I saw him was when we were both in the Senate together; I will never forget having lunch with him one evening as the commission sat in waiting room on the Senate floor. When we began our public appearance on behalf of the report he was ready. He had been reading the report to make sure we had it under control (the commission had a very tight schedule) and he looked so confident he could have been a speaker at the Nobel Prize ceremony.

Daniel did a remarkable job at preparing the evidence base to explain the conditions under which African-American children were being raised in America. I think he was one of the most articulate and effective public officials that I have ever been privileged to know.

I have no question that, if we had the opportunity to work together, we could have improved the situation of black Americans in America. The Moynihan Report put forth a detailed agenda to do just that.

In the years since, I have known many of the families whom the Moynihan Report described. I was particularly struck by their sense of personal disappointment and despair; they were living in the worst of times and yet they continued to cling to what had been. But I also knew that every family had to deal with these challenging circumstances. Daniel's call for action against family breakdown was not just about policy; it was also about personal responsibility. It was about making sure each member of our families had a stake in how well we would raise our own children.

We are now in a new era. The social problems the Moynihan Report described are well past their peak. The nation is a very different place today than in 1964. There is no question that the problems of single motherhood and fatherlessness that helped to create the Moynihan Report are still there. There is some evidence that many of these problems have worsened since then. The problem, though, is no longer that people stay single, it is that couples cannot form stable, integrated families.

The Moynihan Report was not a black report. It was about black lives, not just white lives. It was about children, a child's life, not just about parents in prison. It took a very difficult issue, a highly emotional issue that many people felt strongly about but did not really have an empirical, scientific answer for. That was the problem.

THE REPRESENTATIVES: We will address that.

The Moynihan Report had a strong racial bias which should inform our conclusions today. It was a product of a time in which race continued to play a significant role in U.S. history and political culture, and was in many respects a part of the same discussion. I have been asked about the racial bias in the report, and as you heard, all of our participants in the panel have discussed that issue. It is certainly not the case at all. You heard from various participants that the report was written and discussed very rationally. There was one witness who actually read the report to a group of university students from the early 1960s and they were astonished that the problems that the report described had not been addressed in that time.

You will also hear from a witness who talked about her own experience with child abuse; many child maltreatment cases that were addressed in the report were addressed in terms of male authority. We all recognize there is no one single cause, as one participant so eloquently put it, of child maltreatment but the Moynihan Report focused

 with everything he said about the role that black males played in the nation's struggles for civil rights. But I admired Daniel because he said what I wanted to hear. He warned the nation at the time about the perils of social injustice and racism and discrimination, and then he advocated policy responses directed toward addressing these threats.

It has been 40 years since Moynihan's Report was first issued, so I am surprised that nothing has been done to reverse fatherlessness and family disintegration. However, there are many good things happening. The child support enforcement system has begun to work. Welfare reform is being implemented; federal aid to lower-income families has been tightened. And of course, the country is finally dealing with the legacy of segregation—racial discrimination in educational opportunities and housing segregation—and dealing with it in ways that are meaningful, not just symbolism, but actually effective in solving the problems.

We cannot talk about this issue now without talking about poverty; this is the basic issue. Poverty is a deeply social problem that affects both black and white Americans. We can debate whether the problems in the black community are caused by the racial discrimination system or by poverty. But it is certainly true that the lack of economic opportunity that black Americans face is a major source of the problems that have to do with housing segregation, racial discrimination in education, and other aspects of poverty.

Poverty is a deeply social problem that affects both black and white Americans.

What are the most urgent problems in this field? What are some of the most important issues that the poverty panel identified? For Moynihan, the problems seemed to be that there was an overrepresentation of blacks in low-paying jobs, that there were a high number of black men of prime age—prime age being 17 to 25 years old—who were being unable to pay for housing and were thus forced to live in their parents' basements. Moynihan called this "the third generation," and in this context it applies quite closely to the situation of black males.

As an initial matter, I want to make it clear that Moynihan's concerns and predictions about race and class were indeed correct. Since the 1960s, as I explained in my earlier article, blacks have had the lowest median household income of any racial or ethnic group in the United States. This is not in question. What is more problematic is that there is a very high degree of mobility among blacks, and therefore, a low degree of upward mobility among blacks. So the fact that blacks have the poorest median income and the greatest proportion of their young people living in their parents' basements has an important effect on the opportunities that young people have to move up. There are two problems that arise from this. The first, which you pointed out before, is that once you have a relatively low-income family, your chances of moving up in a middle-income, white family are very low, so as a result, blacks tend to end up in the same sorts of neighborhoods, be it urban neighborhoods or rural neighborhoods. In fact, the same neighborhoods in which many African-American children grew up have become a source of a serious source of social problems and of social disadvantage, as you said earlier in your testimony.

The second and perhaps more salient issue is that when you move up from lower-income levels, your chances of upward mobility are very low. We have seen this in the case of African-American children. Because of that, the opportunity gap between black and white Americans becomes larger. So not only do they have much lower incomes than whites, they also have much lower incomes in relative terms, in terms of family income and resources, relative to white Americans. So that, coupled with the fact that black families end up in much higher concentrations

==================== COMPLETION 335 ====================
 with that statement of Professor Moynihan when he said that a social system cannot exist that does not recognize that there are differences and that is what all our society is trying to do.

In fact it goes much farther than that because the other part of his statement was that there are differences from generation to generation. And in effect he is saying that all social systems should take account that each individual is the product of social conditions, and that we should take account of each individual in any of our institutions that is aimed at the prevention of poverty in our community.

I think that in other words the basic principle is right on, but it is often misused. I will give you one, one example of that.

We know that in certain subcultures, families will be closely knit and will have a strong moral code. I am referring to, say, the Irish Catholic or the Greek Orthodox Church in the United States. If you want to change these things in these subcultures, you have to make a very strong effort and that is what we have not succeeded in doing. We are trying to do that here; I think what we have done, however, is to change other parts of the population.

When we are successful in doing it in the case of subcultures or ethnic organizations, I think we think we are changing the whole society. If the aim of the society that we are trying to change is poverty—we have not succeeded, and that's another way of putting it that we have to change the entire society in a very fundamental way but the subculture is an important group that we have failed to change, because we have not changed the values and ideals of the subculture.

I am not saying the values and ideals of a black community cannot be changed, in fact they can but are not enough. The aim of government and, in fact, the aim of private philanthropy is to change the values and ideals of individuals in order to make them as good as possible. The goal of government is to make individuals as good as possible. I think what we should be striving for is not just change in individual values and ideals but rather the change of family values.

The traditional family is a family of three. Each member has responsibility just as much as a parent does. We are doing a lot in the United States to enhance the rights of women, to improve their ability to participate in the community but at the same time we need the same thing in the family, where responsibility is shared. And we see that with all of our changes, from the divorce laws, to the welfare system and a whole array of different social programs, when it comes down to the family the role of the fathers is often more important than the role of the mothers.

And I think that is one of the reasons why more and more black men are dropping out of the labor market and they tend to become less than fully integrated in the family because the single parent situation is very difficult and almost impossible, very often very emotionally difficult. It is even more so when you have a young kid going to college and he is not the breadwinner.

I have had many conversations in the past two years with fathers who have had children who are now twenty, twenty-five years old and they said they could never imagine having a child if they could not have full responsibility for him. I see from the data that in the past fifteen years only 50 percent of black children are born out of wed­lock and the real challenge is how to change that situation, not just because it is not good for society but because if you fail to recognize fatherhood the whole thing will disintegrate.[2]

 with everything he said, but I admired him and learned something from him. And when I think about my own experiences in family history and in our own country, I think that he had some great things to say about a very complicated subject.

So in 1968, I wrote him a letter of introduction because I thought, "If anyone can do this, he can be the person to write this book" (Lucky Joe). I talked with him when he came to Princeton, and I saw him again in 1968, when he became secretary of labor. During those years I didn't have any kind of contact with any of the people he talked about. He was doing these reports and stuff after he was secretary of labor. I never did see him again.

And now that this book is out and a lot of people, especially in academia, are really talking about it, I was wondering whether you knew of other academics who had anything to say.

DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN JR.: As for academics in general, I've only heard about a couple of them so far. One of the important things of Mr. Moynihan's work in particular was the effort to bring the data and the conclusions of the data and the data to the individual. His point was that no one individual person could make any kind of change, and no one person did make a great deal of difference. What we can do is take the data and the conclusions of the data and the findings of the data, and talk about it and try to think about some of the issues and see if there are some ways that we can make more progress in addressing these social problems.

Now, in one sense, we're still in the problem-solving stage. It's clear that many of these problems exist and there are many people who have children who are in need. For example, a new generation has grown up in a world in which the mother has been forced out of the home. We seem to be going in the direction of a culture of child neglect and in which children are being raised by single, non-working mothers. This is of course quite sad. We should all recognize the need for a child-centered family system. We also have people who are divorced or separated who might be in need of some assistance. But the problems that he thought existed and the data and the statistics were not sufficient enough to give a social or a economic or a political message, to say, "This is what is happening to my child."

Lately, with the rise in the divorce rate, there are a lot of people who are not only divorcing but who are getting divorced over the Internet. So the situation has changed. The issues that needed to be addressed are far from being dealt with in the public policy and social policies. I know several scholars at some universities who have suggested that there might be some ways in which we could look at these problems of family disintegration as a matter of public policy.

My own view is that we have enough problems in society that we should be looking at the problem-solving stage first. My own view has been that if we are going to solve the problems that social scientists have identified as being real, important and pressing, then we need to first of all understand the data and get some data to be able to talk about these important problems. We shouldn't have these huge policy documents that deal with things that are not important.

The latter 2 stats are of course optional, but if you're struggling with life and/or mana, these can be very useful.You want a high ES helmet for the extra ES. Since you're going for a high ES chestpiece, I'd put the ES on the boots or gloves. A rare ES chest piece on a rare item would be perfect to make room for a good quality Life Flask of Heat. You only need 2 Quicksilver Flasks for the build - I recommend a Surgeon's Quicksilver Flask. If you don't have 1 or 2 Quicksilver Flasks and are in doubt, you can also run a Ruby Flask for faster mana regen. A rare ES Helmet for the extra ES.High ES gloves/boots is optional and I've had some success with a pair of Vyr's Vestment instead.A good 4L chest is essential for this build. It will allow you to run the full 4 Frenzy charges in addition to your regular 3 charges. However, you might be slightly lacking one or two damage nodes on the tree. The 4L chest will allow you to add a 6th Frenzy charge which will provide you with a very powerful damage boost.I recommend either a Rares or Jewels on this chest piece. If you want to go rare rings, you might want to consider getting a ring with a damage node somewhere on the tree (try to get one node on the passive tree to the right of the skill point). A good 4L chest piece for the best in slot is a Rares Amulet, unless you are lucky enough to get a 6L Amulet on the passive tree.For the other equipment components, you'll want to prioritize Life, Resistances, ES and Flat Lightning Damage. A very good combination is a Rares Chest piece with Life, Resistances, ES and Flat Lightning Damage, Life and Resistances. You can even consider going for a rare ES Chest piece on a rare item to improve your DPS. I personally prefer Life over Resistances on gear because I get more damage increase from my life nodes on the tree.

Life: The majority of your damage will come from life, since you're a high damage character.

Resists: Life is the number one stat on this item and you'll be putting an insane amount of it on it, so getting as much as possible is very important. Don't bother adding any Elemental Resistances for now.

Damage: All DPS builds want to use as much damage generation as possible. There are three viable options to choose from with this:


1. Life +% increased Damage

2. Life +% Physical Damage

3. Life +% increased Area Damage

If you're using the 4L Lightning Coil, you'll be using Lightning Coil's damage instead of your life. You'll still need around 10k DPS to be as high as the Daresso's Defiance build, but the Life +% increased Area Damage will help a lot in clearing Shaper, and also to reach the higher damage cap of 6,500,000.

The % Physical damage option is good for the increased Armour bonus in an Armour/Evasion based build. In a +Life Gear build, the bonus from a non-life gear item can add a lot to your damage, especially as you reach higher gear levels. For the +% Physical damage, I personally really like the Diamond Ring / Ruby Ring combo for obvious reasons.


Jewels on the Chest:

Life: The majority of your damage will come from life, since you're a high damage character.Resists: Life is the number one stat on this item and you'll be putting an insane amount of it on it, so getting as much as possible is very important. Don't bother adding any Elemental Resistances for now.Damage: All DPS builds want to use as much damage generation as possible. There are three viable options to choose from with this:1. Life +% increased Damage2. Life +% increased Area Damage3. Life +% increased Area DamageIf you're using the 4L Lightning Coil, you'll be using Lightning Coil's damage instead of your life.

Up til around level 70 or so, I used this chest piece to moderate success.Hyaon's Fury is my main weapon and I managed to get this decently rolled one for 3c. Try to get a high attack speed roll. The DPS is insane and can be a lot higher with more frenzy charges. However, since I didn't want to go overboard with the increased damage taken, I only run 4 Frenzy charges which gives me 12% increased damage taken which isn't too big of a deal.I'm running Blood Dance boots for the Frenzy charge generation since the degen from Blood-rage is quite dangerous, especially when all my life regeneration is applied to my Zealot's Oath + Eldritch Battery + MoM combo.I use a Lightning Coil as my 5L chest piece. Lightning Coil provides a strong defensive boost and synergises very well with Mind Over Matter. This item can be substituted for a decent 5L Armour/Evasion chest. Daresso's Defiance and Belly of the Beast are also great options.Ideally, on your jewellery, you generally want flat lightning damage, Life, Resistances and WED

/ES. The following gems should be on your jewellery at all times:WED, Controlled Destruction, Spell Totem, Curse on Hit (optional).Curses should be any other curses and Elemental Weakness is very good in addition to the other defences you provide. I generally swap in Reduced Mana which gives me 4 skill points on my gem slots and the mana it would cost me to run this one without Curses. You can run both curses if you'd like.The rest of your jewels should be either flat physical damage or life on hit (not flat ES so don't go overboard) and the following gems on your jewellery at all times:Cast when Damage Taken, Immortal Call, Flammability, Tempest Shield.You might be missing some good gems (especially flammability, if you are running a lot of physical damage output over a short period of time). Try to roll your mana in a way that isn't very expensive or you can be extremely conservative and run some cheap mana rolls such as 40+ mana on a 6L.You should be using 2x Enduring Cry and 2x Ancestral Protector to help mitigate reflect and other mobs' totems. The totem phase is very strong and should be used to farm totems. If your defenses allow, you can run a few more curses (I run Purity to curse enemies with Elemental Weakness or to run Disfavour which gives 10% reduced damage taken). The rest of the defensive setup is up to you.Flasks can be any of the following depending on how far you are from death. At-ziri: Quicksilver, topaz, Ruby, Topaz, Amethyst. Atziri (Uber): Aquamarine, Topaz, Ruby. Uber Atziri and Atziri's Temple (Death): Coral, Ruby. Uber Lab and Shrine (Death): Rubies, Topaz, Diamond. Dying in Atziri gives you 15% MORE Damage over Time, which can be amazing. If you are on an Atziri kill (Uber Atziri) you can use a flask that permanently grants you 10% MORE Damage over Time.You do NOT need a Quicksilver flask for this build, however I do suggest having one. This flask will massively boost your mobility as well as your survivability in order to be able to jump between packs with ease (not like the one on Malachai, but still).You do NOT need to use Atziri's Disfavour to be able to clear this build. This is my personal preference for this build (as well as the way it is meant to be played). This build revolves around getting into a fight and having a high life pool, which we do by spamming Endurance Charges. We don't want to die quickly, so in order to mitigate that we use Disfavour which effectively causes our Endurance Charges to provide us with another 3% of our maximum life regeneration, per Endurance Charge. This is more than enough to make this build safe and survivable, for at least 30-40 seconds each Endurance Charge (depending on your gear and the level of damage we are taking).In my testing, I found that using a Ruby Flask and Dying in the Blood (Earthen Heart) with Disfavour is the easiest way to play the build without the need to resummon any corpses. You have to avoid taking damage by the duration of your Disfavour if you can, but dying is a risk that you are willing to take.Since this is a very budget, early-mid level build, I chose to pick up a Taste of Hate for the chance to roll one of the uniques required for the Ascendancy, but you can use the Unset Rings instead. They are cheaper but don't provide the

. Since you have to get 10 intelligence on every single piece, don't worry! Get the life/resists/damage you can so that all your skills will scale off those stats while remaining effective.I get 10 intelligence for about 2ex so that my skills scale nicely off intelligence. Note that you need the correct stats to get them. I chose the following stats for each Jewellery:Lightning Resistance, Life, ResistsLife, Increased Attack Speed, Chaos Damage, Attack Speed, Added Lightning Damage, Added Fire Damage. (In general, these don't change as you level but are better to put on higher intelligence based gems.)Try to get as much Intelligence as possible on your gear so that you can stack intelligence based spells like Blood Rage, Arctic Armour, Purity of Ice, Flame Dash and so much more!If you can, get the highest fire resistance possible because most of your damage will be done in physical damage so it is recommended that you get a base fire resistance roll of 30% or higher. If you can't, at least get elemental resistance as your resist roll which is still great and will make things a lot easier.If you're using this build and really want to go high end, you can use a 6L (if you can afford it), 6L chest and get life/resistances/physical damage on everything you can possibly fit on. If you're using a 4L you'll be able to use a 2H chest but you'll lose a bit of AoE. I used a 5L for this build so I wasn't at risk of having a dead 4L :(There are other unique items that are great for this build that are cheaper but might take some extra getting used to.

MID GAME SPELL CHOICES

This game requires a very high level of build mastery and I highly recommend going for this in your early game play:


Gem Links:

- Vaal Haste + Increased Area of Effect + Vaal Grace + Increased Duration + Increased Duration (5L)

- Blood Rage + Ancestral Protector (4L)

- Blood Rage + Arctic Armour

- Blood Rage + Enlighten

- Immortal Call + Increased Duration (4)

- Phase Run (6L)


For gems to level up your tree you want:

- Faster Casting

- Minion Damage

- Reduced Mana

- Reduced Mana Reservation

- Minion Speed


For a cheap and easy way to make sure you don't use any mana or ES regen on your boots this gem can help with that by helping you get around 5-6 casts of a spell per second:

- Cast when Damage Taken + Vaal Haste + Increased Duration

- Culling Strike + Life Leeched per second + Lesser Multiple Projectiles (2L)

- Culling Strike + Life Leeched per second (4L)


I'd advise to start out with the 1L version of these gems as that should give you a lot of utility with the increased duration and Culling Strike if you're running 2 of them. It is also nice for clearing maps when you don't have a Blood Rage + Arctic Breath.


MOST IMPORTANTLY, the skill tree has 3 major nodes towards the end so that you have the option to level up more damage based on your mana and the other skills you chose to use more or less freely. Those skills are:


- Warlord's Mark (level 6)

- Elemental Weakness (level 9)

- Elemental Equilibrium (level 15)


With a 5L chest, you'll be able to use a 2H belt to support

The trigger man was later convicted and received a short prison term; his accomplices in the corridors of power and the traitor within the headquarters who made the phone call telling the gunman where Rockwell would be were never charged or punished. [ Harold Covington, "Who is George Lincoln Rockwell?" (2005) ]
The accusation was also repeated in A Brief History of the White Nationalist Movement, which Covington has denied writing, but was certainly very active in promoting and distributing (2007): ... what has never been satisfactorily explained was precisely how Patler knew where Rockwell would be and when , in order to intercept and ambush his victim. It is clear from any objective examination of the evidence that Patler had at least one accomplice inside the old Party headquarters....

Plaster, leader of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement, a movement that was part of the Nazi regime as well, and had a presence in the US prior to 1939. [ John N. Whitehead, "The Rise of the Nazi Party in the US," in Plaster, 1994, p. 9 ] The latter had a special relationship with Rockwell, because both of them were part of the National Socialist Movement. [ Charles J. Plaster, "The Nazi Party in the US and the Struggle for Identity," in Frenz, 2008, pp. 29-30 ] (p. 8). This is one of a number of interesting details in the book, as well as a reference to the "Coon and Eichmann" case, as well as an argument that the National Socialist Movement should be considered the same as a "Nazi Party": The National Socialist Movement emerged in response to the failure of the "Nazi Party" to find a national or international constituency for its position, its ideology, its policies or its form of rule. This was the conclusion of one of the most distinguished sociologists of the Nazi Party, Dr. Walter Stangen. "It is a party of the mind, not the mouth" (Stangen, 1976, p. 32). [ John N. Whitehead, "The Rise of the Nazi Party in the US," in Covington, 2005, p. 5 ]
It should also be pointed out that at the time, and probably still today, there are many of the National Socialists who are also members of the National Alliance. In fact, the National Alliance was very nearly renamed the National Front under new leadership. [ John N. Whitehead, A Brief History of White Nationalism (1997), pp. 17-18. ]
The final point to make relates to a statement in the book, "The Last Battle: A Life and Times of George Lincoln Rockwell," in which one of the authors explains why there is no evidence of a direct relationship between NAA and Nazism: This is not a coincidence, it was the policy of the NAA to stay out of the National Socialist Movement. George Lincoln Rockwell Jr. was never much for the NAA's social programs nor its "rebranding." Neither was he a Nazi. [ John N. Whitehead, A Brief History of White Nationalism (1997), p. 34 ] The argument would seem to be that there wasn't a direct relationship because there wasn't any evidence that Nazism and Nazism/KKK was in any way or form affiliated with the National Alliance. This is a very strange and illogical conclusion, as it does not provide any explanation for the Nazi connection, but only denies it. It is also, needless to say, not true.
[ Footnote 6 ] The official policy towards the Communists was one that was similar in many ways to an official policy toward NAA, in that the National Socialist Movement and National Socialist movement were part and parcel of Naziism. As a part of National Socialism it is the responsibility of all National Socialists to destroy the Communists, since a Communist takeover will bring about destruction of the German Aryan Race

well's whereabouts by a telephone call, and they did not need or want such advice... In view of the facts, this explanation is at best an elaborate ruse to explain the evidence away—and at worst just a conspiracy theory. What does it mean, then, that Rockwell was killed as he and his wife were driving through Chicago in September 1940? Rockwell's wife, Mary, and his brother Joseph were on their way back for a visit that evening from their summer home in Colorado, and they could have easily headed for a movie that would have been running nearby at the Century theater on the city's lakefront. Indeed, in his later letters to his mother-in-law, Rockwell describes the day as a "beautiful day... full of pleasure and peace." So what is more likely, the Rockwells were at the movies, or they were on their way back, to the home where their lives had begun, and had just left in good spirits for a drive to the Illinois State Fair the day before, the day before the shootings?
The next question to be addressed is one that is seldom addressed, at least by the mainstream historians who are currently writing on Rockwell and the origins of our National Socialist movement; that is the question of why the Chicago Tribune's coverage of the Rockwell shooting was almost universally negative, and virtually ignored any public discussion of what, according to the Chicago Police, was a self-defense murder. The two reporters who covered the Rockwell shooting and who later served as editors for the Chicago Tribune both claim that the coverage was unfavorable. [ Robert K. Connell and Charles H. Foner, " The Chicago Tribune's Coverage of the Rockwell Murder," (1999) , pp. 36-39] Rockwell's death also was barely mentioned in the Chicago Weekly World and its successor, as well as in a local radio broadcast and in a local Chicago weekly. [ Charles C. Jones, James J. O'Neal and Daniel J. Gaido, "The Life of George Lincoln Rockwell," (2011), pp. 50ff., p. 50] Although I did the latter analysis myself in the book, it was a labor of love that required me to read up several hundred articles from the Chicago-area newspapers during a three month period in September, 1941, and the Rockwell shooting appeared only once in a half-dozen articles. Rockwell did mention the killings in his published writings; as a matter of fact he said that this was the reason he had chosen the name for his newspaper—Rockwell Report, in large part because he knew it would be mentioned in the paper (it wasn't) and because it provided a name—he preferred not to share it, because he did not want the reader to confuse it with some other type of newspaper, such as the Chicago Daily News, or some other major publication. This was certainly the case when he appeared before the American Jewish Committee, on April 23, 1942, when he said that "I have a feeling that the more I speak, the more I should be called names, but I have to protect my newspaper." It seems that the paper did not appreciate the fact that the Chicago Jewish Congress gave no coverage to his statement, or that many Jewish newspapers, such as the Philadelphia Inquirer, did, or that the Chicago Sentinel, which was only a week away from being taken over by a Jewish consortium, did not even print an editorial opposing the statement. In any case, even after the fact, the paper's readership continued to be in the 50% to 60% range.
So why did the papers not cover the Rockwell shooting? The answer to that question might lie in the fact that as well as a few Jewish newspapers, and some Jewish-owned newspapers with ties

well's precise whereabouts.
It is also unclear whether the assassination happened without any prior prior knowledge of the Rockwell-Patsalos plot. A lot of the evidence cited above was developed in a later prosecution of the men for conspiracy to murder Rockwell by one of the conspirators in the plan, Harry Shoup, who was convicted and received 30 years. The defense, headed at the time by Harry Goldberg, claimed that Shoup, the conspirator who actually pulled the trigger, was a government agent, and that he had been framed by the U.S. Justice Department. This defense gained credence in some circles, though Goldberg and many of his followers, including Norman Podhoretz [editor at large of Commentary ] and Alan Dershowitz , later publicly repudiated it. [ Alan Yurman , "An American Patriot's Attempts to Get at the Truth: Norman Podhoretz at the Nuremberg Trial" (1988) ].
At that time, the case of Norman Podhoretz and his former friend Paul Buhle and Buhle's lawyer John C. Wright, who was a former federal prosecutor, was widely accepted and published. [ Norman Podhoretz, Jr., "A Tribute to Paul Buhle: An Open Letter to Robert Rockwell" (2008) ]. This was the case that brought Podhoretz into the new world of "conspiracy theory" and "anti-conspiracy" writers. [ David Garrow [editor], "Facts and Lies," Newsweek magazine (June 23, 1992): 45, 50 ]
The only official investigation that ever took place of his client's case was carried out by the U.S. Office of Special Investigations. Their conclusions were damning. On June 5, 1975, Norman Podhoretz, Jr., former lawyer for the accused, presented the results of the investigation to a special investigative session of the House Un-American Activities Committee, also known as the HUAC. He described how he had been a target of the investigation because of his political association with Buhle.
In his report that year, Podhoretz's attorney, Wright, said:
It is an interesting fact that during a five-week period beginning in late May of 1972 and ending in late June 1972, [Buhle] was observed from time to time by his [Buhle's] brother, by his security guards, by guards of the UPI offices, by people on duty at the [Office of Special Investigations], by members of the Special Investigations unit, and by several employees of the FBI and other federal agencies. [ Norman Podhoretz, Jr., A Tribute to Paul Buhle " (2008) ]
The investigation was conducted by the O.S.I. [Office of Special Investigations] in the presence and under the direction of the [United States] Attorney General. [ Wright (2-5) : 73-4] It was also overseen, in large part, by the FBI and the Secret Service, whose agents observed Buhle's and Norman Podhoretz's movements and behavior throughout the period under review. [Hearings before the House Committee on Un-American activities, 1970, p. 381-3 ]
The O.S.I. investigation of the assassination was eventually made public, and it was published in full in the U.S. Government Accountability Office Report On The Events Of June 5, 1975 . [ "Hearings," p. 383] [See footnote 7 : "This report was published at the behest of Norman Podhoretz, Jr." ]
This is the source of the claim in The New Republic — which is usually taken as factual — that Podhoret

well's location; the Secret Service officer who had jurisdiction at the time, Robert Frenz, was an officer who had the authority to give directions to other officers regarding who should give directions, and he had such authority during the assassination. [ Robert Frenz, "The First Days, The Last Days, and the Days to Come" , in Robert Frenz, James R. Lewis, and Robert Covington (eds.), A Brief History of the White Nationalist Movement , (2007) ]
Forn z goes on to say, "The fact that the Secret Service officer who was on duty at [the Democratic National Convention] that day had the same authority under the law that George L. Patler received does not in any way mean that Mr. Frenz was in any way authorized to give the order to shoot; it means only that Mr. Frenz was authorized to give the directions that the President would have had to issue at that moment." It is easy to see why Frenz and Co. would not like to put these facts in the public domain. They would be a very inconvenient truth, and the very truth is the reason why Frenz and Co. are so fearful of telling it. The answer to the question "What was the motive for the Kennedy assassination?" has never been satisfactorily explained. One thing we do know: A good chunk of it was a deliberate and premeditated conspiracy to provoke a war between the USA and Russia so as to enable the Illuminati to take over the governments of the western hemisphere. The Russian Empire had been crumbling like dominoes in recent years, as it never had done before, and the American people were waking up to what had been going on since the last days of the 19th century.
The "Russian Secret Agents"
"It was this year, 1917, that Joseph Stalin launched this great revolution."
--Dr. Michael Woodford
There has always been skepticism about how exactly a "Stalinesque coup d'etat" was perpetrated against the government of the American Federation. While it is a fact that certain Russian-oriented oligarchs and the Russian people had their suspicions, until now it was not known who they were or whether they might have somehow had something to do with the Russian Revolution. [ Dr. Michael Woodford, Russian Secret Agents: The Story of an American Coup , (2002) ]
Woodford's work provides an alternative source which provides a good deal of information. From a careful examination of the various sources, that book indicates that the Russian aristocracy was working with the Rothschilds to bring about a "war of the worlds" in order to force an American-Russian war and the overthrow of the Russian government. Woodford has concluded that "It was not the Russians, as has often been asserted, whose revolution was needed in order to avoid a world war; it was the American Jews!" [ Michael Woodford, "Jews and Revolution" )
Woodford's conclusion appears to be supported by his discussion of the Russian "mafia" and their ties to the Illuminati. He says that the secret societies such as the Knights of Malta, the Rosicrucian lodge, and the Illuminati have links with the Russian "mafia." He says that the Russian leaders, such as Nicholas II, were not exactly "noble" in the traditional sense of the word, but he did play into the American plan. In spite of all the anti-Jewish attitudes in the Russian government, Nicholas remained friendly to the United States. If he ever considered defecting, such a move would probably have been taken into consideration, as Woodford has pointed out it would be very easy.
The most revealing quote from Woodford was the following:

Whew, that was ugly. At least you can't accuse Hollowell of being inactive.

Hollowell did mix in an offensive rebound that led to a Victor Oladipo bucket, and he made a nice extra pass to Jordy Hulls for an open 3-pointer, which he missed (WHAT?!). So it wasn't all bad, just about 98 percent bad.

I fully expected Hollowell to pretty much shut it down from there. I mean, after that stretch and what he's done the last four games, I figured he'd come in and play a little Tom Pritchard ball -- pass, screen (half the time a moving screen with ol' Pritch) and rebound.

Hollowell made his first appearance of the second half at the 8:41 mark. He wasn't shy this time, either. Although there was a little less pressure now that the game was a full-blown smackdown (70-54).

With 7:53 left in the contest, the Lawrence Central native, again on his first touch, got the ball at the top of

 the key and drove right. Unfortunately, he took his first step and went airborne as he caught the ball with his right hand on a pump fake. He hit the ground and landed flat on his back while the crowd exploded. He took a long walk to the bench.

He left the bench early, too, before the final buzzer sounded.

That was probably the best we could've expected.

It wasn't ugly all game long, but that third quarter was the worst of it. It's amazing that he played all game long. He's been terrific (and will probably take over as the starting center when Gorgui Dieng returns to the lineup).

At one point he had seven or more points in eight straight minutes. On one particular run early in the third, Hollowell scored 10 straight points in just 5:25. He made a couple of 3s and had a block. And this dude is a pro.

But for the fourth quarter, he was on his own.

The good news? If this is anything like last season, his minutes are surely going up with the return of Dieng and Ben Simmons, even if they're also adding more players who bring a toughness factor that Hollowell is not.

But I will say that after his first game back and all of his minutes, we might look back on this year and say, "Wow, what a great start."<|endoftext|>An Australian businessman says he wants a "buzzy" $1 billion for Brisbane's proposed $1.3 billion Cbus casino, and he is offering $200 million worth of his company on the table to help pay for it.

I know what ya'll are thinking: "But Tom Pritchard was playing at Miami back in October ... he's not that bad." I won't argue. But, I thought he'd help in the pick-and-roll, in which the Bulls need all of their depth at the point forward position.

Hollowell, for the third time in this game, had a tough time staying with Mario Chalmers after he went inbounds to him on a screen. Hulls also got a little open at the basket with some decent help on the play.

After three games, the Bulls will take the next few days to work out the kinks. When they return to the United Center, they should get a great test against a team that has lost eight of ten against Chicago in the regular season.<|endoftext|>About

The concept for our game The Maze is an interesting one, when you think about it.

One Day, you wake up, you hear your phone vibrating, you pick it up, open the app to see a message from your co-workers, "you are in the job of 'Manager of the game' of an android game" "We are hiring, we need a good game developer. We will pay you double what you are, so make your game great and come to work today" you are surprised with this news, you see in front of you a giant android box, but what will it be filled with, you don't know, that this is the job you will have, there will be a box full of puzzles and puzzles, with your first task: to create a puzzle by placing all the cards with different types of cards in the correct spots.

After your work you have an email stating "that is it" with details about the compensation that come with being the "Manager of the game of an android game". If you accept this offer you will have to face a tough road since it looks like all your hard work has been wasted: you will not have any salary for six months, and you will not be able to do anything you enjoy. The reward for being the "Manager of the Game" of an android game will come after six months' work: a nice car with which to drive your new colleagues and your co-workers.

You, as the developer, can do only one thing, and that is to create a game. You will probably have to write your own language, as you don't know one. You may be asked to learn a bit of coding for your task, which will only take you a few days. The money that you will have to pay for your car will be not more than a few thousand dollars, and you will have to do everything for the cost of the car. You will be the "Manager of the Game" of an android game, you will be an amazing "boss", you will be the only one who knows how to put all the cards, which are different types of cards, in the correct orders, in the correct spots of the box of the "Maze" game. You will have to get all the cards to the correct places, where they can be found at the end of the game. And you won't be able to do this without being angry a lot, or possibly with your stomach on fire (we are making no promises with respect to the level of anger, stomach burning for both)

It's a classic "vegan feast" as most of my recipes are in the vein of the "meat" dishes that we're used to in the Western sense of the word.

I think I'm a meat eater. I've enjoyed pork and beef and lamb, as well as chicken and turkey, but that's only because those are the proteins I most frequently consume. I'm not big into fish; I just do not like the taste. My father used to tell me that the fish at local restaurants in England were more foul-smelling than that of a fish at a local fish shop. The fish I like is the real deal, a kind of fish "salad" like the kind we'd buy in France and Italy, and the kind we could find in the West End Market, an area of London famous for its fish market.

I really appreciate this because I'm a bit of a Londoner. I went to London as an adult—I'm 34 now—and when I first got a job I chose to get a job at a vegetarian restaurant, where I worked my first 9 years of my career until I moved into teaching. (So I guess this is kind of like the first time a British tourist made it into the world, isn't it? And the first time someone made it into the vegetarian menu. Like, come on, it had to be.)

I know that if I hadn't been offered a job in an English-run restaurant I would've ended up being a full-time vegetarian, but here I am. And I still love that my job is in a place where, for the most of the year, you don't see animals. (Actually, not so much with the weather coming up; we do see a lot of animals in the supermarket, but not when temperatures are in the 60s. Just kidding and that's cold weather.) That's the kind of restaurant I go to.

I had a lot of questions after my first visit to the "British" veggie market the other day. What about vegetables? Why don't we just give up carrots and cabbage? (What's that? You don't think that carrots are vegan? How did I get here?) But at least you have a place where your vegetables can taste so damn good that they'll make you want to eat meat or fish again

He also had a dunk on James Blackmon Jr., who was in foul trouble.

The table is defined in the file dbo.migration in the following format:

CREATE TABLE [ table_name ] ( [ column_name ] [ , data_type ] [ , column_type ] [ , index_name ] [ , ... ] ) [, database ] [[ source_table_name ]] ( [ table_name ] [ , ... ] ), [[ destination_table_name ]] ( [ table_name ] [ , ... ] ) WITH ( GENERATED ALWAYS AS TABLE ( [ schema_name ] [ , column_name ] [ , data_type ] [ , column_type ] [ , index_name ] [ , ... ] ) [, source_id ] ) [, destination_id ] ) AS [ migration_table_name [ table_name ]]; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 CREATE TABLE [ table_name ] ( [ column_name ] [ , data_type ] [ , column_type ] [ , index_name ] [ , . . . ] ) [ , database ] [ [ source_table_name ]] ( [ table_name ] [ , . . ] ) WITH ( GENERATED ALWAYS AS TABLE ( [ schema_name ] [ , column_name ] [ , data_type ] [ , column_type ] [ , index_name ] [ , . . . ] ) [ , source_id ] ) [ , destination_id ] ) AS [ migration_table_name [ table_name ] ] ;

Hey Christopher,

Looks like everything is sorted, and I'll go ahead and apologize for my staff's behavior on Twitter, which is pretty much what I assumed would happen if we hadn't published that post, so I hope it makes a bit more sense why we did so now!

As for the Ethics Policy, I really see no issue with you using the old one so long as it's attributed to us – maybe a line at the bottom that it was used with permission from us with a do-follow link back to our current ethics policy?

As for the Patreon, that's messed up on their part. Since it was a third party, I can totally understand that you wouldn't know what they did. If it's fixed, I see no issue now.

We'd like to apologize as well, as we made a pretty big mistake in not waiting longer than 24 hours. With E3 and everything going on, tensions have been high, so what we did was kind of a knee jerk reaction to prevent any issue with the news coming out via social media (Which
==================== COMPLETION 353 ====================
 is understandable, but it's going to cause a lot of resentment – especially because this happened in our first week of operation) and make it look like we were doing something that we were not (we had absolutely nothing to do with the story, did not post or link to it, and even reached out to the publisher multiple times to assure them that nothing untoward was happening). At the time, we didn't plan on doing anything with the article other than correcting what was out there. Now, having talked to the publisher about how to get the story out in a way that would be more palatable for the readers, I'm sure we're going to do a much better job of the post.

In regards to the Patreon, we just want you to know that we're doing everything in our power to try to get this all cleaned up – that's why we're doing this Patreon push (which we've been doing for a while now). We'll never be fully 100% positive that everything is totally correct (especially because we're trying to take a look at everything, at every second of every single week), and that will always be an issue. What we can assured of, though, is that no harm was done and that your Patreon has been a good thing for the site.

Thanks again for your understanding.

All right, thanks again for the information and apologies for the staff's bad behavior a while back. This has been a much needed breath of fresh air.

I wanted to get a heads up to you about the Patreon thing, since they've been getting a fair amount of ire lately as well.

This was done without our knowledge and consent, but we have always been clear on how Patreon works. You have the option of adding one of our writers to your Patreon, but it means that we cannot review these donations, so if you're feeling that there's something fishy about a donation, you should definitely reach out to me (@SambiLion) via Twitter, and I'd be happy to help you out if you have any questions. While I cannot provide you the legal side of things, I can assure you that our legal team is monitoring things now and will be taking a closer look at this situation. Until we are completely happy with this situation, though, I will ask everyone to be very careful to make sure you're aware what's going on (and when people donate). I'd prefer nothing, and I'd rather focus on promoting games that might not get the attention that they deserve.

That being said, I'd really like to help a ton of people, so I am looking into this to make sure that everyone gets the most benefit out of this. I will contact you once I've made sure that everything from this post is clear, so don't be surprised if I update that post with that later this week.

Thanks again and please keep sharing.

I'm not mad, but I do find it odd that people are arguing that an article on a site that's trying to sell you anything should not have been linked, because you wouldn't have known it was our stuff.

I don't think we should be responsible for whether our article got posted, but it shouldn't be up to a user to decide whether that article appears, so even if we didn't link it, everyone should have gotten the information they were looking for and if our article didn't meet their expectations then that is definitely an issue.

While we don't have an issue with Patreon, when someone links the article (something that wasn't even possible in this case), then I do think people are missing

She added that she would wait to discuss the committee matter until the Ethics Committee completes its inquiry.

"It is unfortunate that, despite her many accomplishments and contributions to this country, she had to go through this process," the statement said.

Ms. McDonough's work has included many high-profile and sometimes contentious votes. During the Bush years, she repeatedly voted against his nominations, including Ms. Hagel, and she was the lone Democratic House member to oppose him for secretary of defense.

The Senate confirmed her for the No. 2 job, as deputy director of the White House office of legislative affairs, in April 2007. But when the Senate confirmed her successor, Peter Orszag, in October, Mr. Orszag was forced to step down amid a political uproar over his role in the housing crisis.

Ms. McDonough's office has not responded to a request for an interview.

Ms. McDonough, 52, is married with two small children. When she was named deputy director last year, there was much public talk about how she might handle the more contentious political issues.

But the internal disputes at the White House may have helped her to move quickly to the deputy chief of staff's job.

Ms. McDonough had worked in the White House for more than a decade, before Mr. Orszag. The Senate confirmed her for the No. 2 job in April 2007 — less than two years after the deputy chief of staff job was created.

The White House officials did not identify the White House lawyers who recommended Ms. McDonough for the deputy chief of staff job, saying only that they had reviewed her legal work at the time.

Ms. McDonough had been a member of the staff of Senator Al Franken , Democrat of Minnesota , for five years before joining Mr. Obama's administration. She had served on the National Security Council staff in the Clinton administration and had been in private practice in Washington for many years.

A spokesman for Mr. Biden, Michael J. Daschle , said Ms. McDonough "is highly regarded."

"The vice president looks forward to working with her" on the White House staff, Mr. Daschle said.

Mr. Biden's spokesman, Ben LaBolt , confirmed that Ms. McDonough's

The system has started to roll out to a small number of iPhone X pre-order customers and pre-ordered Mac models.

Upon searching a query with Siri via either the Safari or the Settings app, the system responded with an array of text queries, including the name of a nearby cafe, my schedule for the day as well as other useful queries.

The proposed $13.7 million plan would convert the east side of the Denver School of Business from its current, parking-free state through a series of underground and above-ground structures. The city has already purchased the adjacent property for a parking structure, and is proposing to convert the entire east side of the building, along the south side of Bannock Street, and across the street from the Denver Public Library, into an enormous parking structure.

"The project will include three parking levels on the east and northeast portions, along with a fifth-floor commercial level and additional parking above ground level," according to a memo circulated on March 30.

Denver Department of Transportation officials said construction could begin as early as next year and be completed in three to six years, but they have not committed to a date.

"The design and engineering of the parking structure will require extensive study and consultation with local, state and city agencies and organizations," the city wrote in a written statement. "The city does not have any current commitments to begin construction."

The project could end anywhere from as late as 2034 to as early as 2046, according to the memo.

Dennis Croon, a member of the Denver Department of Transportation board and president of DCTB, said a lot of things could happen next year that could force the department to delay the project significantly, but "if they're ready by March 30 to put it on the board, they'll go on it. I'm not confident they're going to be able to hold it back much longer than that." There's no reason to delay when there's "so much at stake," he added. "There's no need to drag it out, it's too important."

But it's no secret that there's a lot at stake when it comes to Denver's parking supply. Denver is one of only a handful of American cities that does not allow parking meters, according to a February 2015 city report. Other cities that do allow meters are Phoenix, Memphis, San Diego, Minneapolis and Milwaukee.

The city plans to add as many as 7,500 parking spaces over the next 30 years to accommodate anticipated population growth.

"Demand continues to increase, but we know that it's a challenge to expand the amount of parking space to accommodate the growing population," said David Akins, the city's director of transportation planning and management.

The DCTB is considering how to ease that parking shortage, said Akins.

"It's a big challenge. People are starting to come in to the city, and you have to make room."<|endoftext|>HBO's "Game of Thrones" is in the midst of a huge marketing campaign, and the best part of it is what's going to take place outside of Westeros when we're not seeing the characters fight for their lives.

Any success is likely to be pyrrhic, the author says, la resistance laughing all the way to their mass graves. Witness General Iberico Saint Jean, governor of Buenos Aires during the Terror of 1976, who said, "First we kill all the subversives; then, their collaborators; later, those who sympathize with them; afterward, those who remain indifferent; and finally, the undecided." (p. 403) Sadly, El General was not kidding, promoting a policy of indiscriminate raids, torture, and killings that purged 15-30,000 Argentine lives.Dyer isn't wholly contemptuous of guerilla tactics, he just thinks minimal, anticrime measures sufficient to contain any existential risk to the status quo and thereby promote the survival of our present civilization. Thus, at pp. 415-6, he writes:Quoting Stella Rimington, a former director-general of MI5, armed conflict will be with us for as long as "there are people with grievances."

its because people will not submit to our rule voluntarily. So, even those who do not oppose us militarily, can be manipulated to pursue an oppositional course. As El General says, "To the extent that a person has grievances, to the extent that he is resisting domination or oppression, he is an opponent."Dyer isn't wrong that "the status quo" may be a "deterioration, decline, and collapse, or even outright collapse, of the civilization that has made it so difficult and dangerous to maintain." At p. 416, he asserts:A year, or a century? How long ago did the "status quo" begin when El General says:Dyer, however, does not cite the passage to back up his assertion, but to back it with a quotation not from the General, but from the late General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the army of Spain: "We, who have been fighting for 150 years, have entered the last stage of this war. It seems to me that it is necessary to take steps now to accelerate this process."The end of the status quo, then, could come during the year 2200. That's not a far-fetched concern. (See my July 28th column. ) The same year that Dyer describes "the beginning of the end" is 2000, and in that year, the Soviet Union will fall apart. By then, there should be no more Communist states in the world. (A decade from now, only three, not four, should remain.) What are the odds that we will see the first Communist world state in 2200? Well, according to El General, the odds are 1 in 200,000 in this life. This might be worth considering if the collapse of the Soviet Union has been delayed as a result of the present world War II. If so, it is a mistake to assume that such a collapse will bring the end of the status quo. It is far more likely that we will see a series of "resumes" among the remaining Communist states such as China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the former Soviet republics, the Philippines, and Thailand. Thus the question arises: Why wouldn't we just keep the status quo, to preserve our ability to continue waging this war?It's not clear to me why Dyer thinks this is likely. The fact that his argument is based on a probability-based argument may be a clue. If so, it should be explained that the probability of a global economic collapse or a planetary planetary catastrophe caused by a nuclear war is very slight and in some cases would be virtually zero. At least this, though, is a discussion best left to the philosophers.<|endoftext|>The last days of spring in Germany are often full of colorful advertisements for new products -- and the latest is for the smartwatch that has no doubt been buzzing through your head. It was announced in March, but as I am finishing this article right now, the "Göttingen Watches" website has started the process of releasing its first watches, with pricing ranging from around €400 to €800, depending with which variant you choose.

It remains to be seen how useful these devices are, though one could think that people would use them the most if they are already wearing one of these smartwatches to their wrists. A quick glance through the comments of many articles on the topic will give a pretty good idea -- people are extremely excited about using something like this as a digital assistant for the things that they do while they are doing so. I am sure that this will happen -- it is inevitable -- but I can't imagine that a smart watch (especially one that can be worn just from one wrist) would be used that often.

its, and we don't want to be stuck in a war for centuries. A key step is to understand "that war is not an end in itself, but a temporary condition to secure certain aims." (ibid.) And finally, while his own recommendations might have some value, (in particular, the idea of a global legal system with global justice), Dyer argues against "a war ethic based simply on self-preservation." At pg. 507, he asserts:There's some things in his article I agree with — the above discussion of the state of affairs is an area I generally agree with him on. But his idea seems to suggest that we can't avoid a war and its attendant collateral damage even if the world as we know it ends. I don't see the point of having a system of global law as the sole driver of how we manage conflict, if we don't agree there should be some way to limit it, and if we don't agree that any war, even a war against Islamic terrorism, should be viewed as an end in itself. There's also a point in here about how we've gone from an idea that war as a means to achieve a desired end of peace to a more utilitarian understanding of conflict, so I'll pick my spots. At pp. 507-14, Dyer says:Now, for those unfamiliar with this, we're in a state with which I have long disagreed — a state where our governments — my government in particular, because I am one of the representatives of the people I represent — the government is no longer the representative of any one group or group of people. It's become the representative of the system of power that it represents. It's no longer the legitimate representative of the people. In that state, we are going to have multiple conflicts going on simultaneously: an arms race as well as a war against global climate breakdown, all of which will increase in intensity. If we can limit the weapons we are going to need in order to achieve these objectives, then not only will there be less violence on earth, but that's going to make our lives (and all of our children's lives for that matter) much better, because we'll have fewer people suffering. (Also, see here The first part makes a good point, and I wholeheartedly agree. But it seems to imply an inherent contradiction here, which is not borne out by the rest of the article. When you think of global climate breakdown, does it seem like a "war against global climate breakdown" to you? I think maybe he's not thinking this through that carefully or maybe he's just talking off the cuff in response to some other statement he has made, or if it wasn't that clear in context. But I'm sure this idea has been around a while). I suspect Dyer has only ever thought about this part of the paper in a way that is similar to my own, but I think that even a brief discussion of the ramifications of global climate breakdown and/or collapse could give us new insights into how we can live in the world we do see, and how to avoid the most destructive scenarios we may see as a result. So I thought I would try to do this and see if the world's population could live more decently with fewer people in the future.Dyer proposes that we can't avoid warfare — only control it. And yet, it seems fairly likely that he doesn't think we can control or suppress the violence we're creating by ourselves, since that seems to be part of "the system of power it represents." If we want that system broken, we have to do it ourselves. Which makes war a self-fulfilling prophecy. (Note for the purposes of this discussion, I'll assume that most people don't intend to

its in Argentina not since the 1970s. Yet, I have always thought that Dyer's description of the US and UK's policies in the 1990s, and of their own experience in the Falklands, was too positive and hopeful; he seemed to have the same hope that history would repeat itself with regard to the Argentinian forces as he apparently does that it will continue to support democracy and freedom. He cites the "disappearance of the military as a major opposition party" and the "return of the military to power," implying a political change in favor of the military-led junta. At no point does he suggest even the most remote possibility of the military becoming a credible partner of the political system.I suspect, however, that he wouldn't have been so critical of the British "dissociation" policy unless he had observed more closely how the policy worked. I think there were more than a few analysts who warned against these policies and the results they produced to the point where the policy has been officially repudiated by the British government.In fact, the British policy of de-policing, separating political leaders from the military, made it impossible to see the situation in a realistic way. As a result, all discussions with leading members of the military in the political, and in particular the "National Security" apparatus, invariably ended with a call for more resources. This created what was basically an anti-democratic situation, and many high-level officials would have resigned in desperation if they had not had ample incentive to retain their jobs. I have yet to see an official document that makes this clear, however; that doesn't mean the government of the day didn't know what was going on. Even if one wanted to blame the policy on a government that was not fully informed, the British are in the same boat as the US, in that they're being pulled to the wall by the people who want the same policies to continue. In both cases, they must find ways to placate the troops because that is their only hope of survival. And their government is in the same position today, although their strategy is slightly different in that they appear to be more pro-American and supportive of a deal with the junta.However, the key here is in the concept of political dissociation. There seems to be a consensus, including among some in the military, in that situation the military takes the lead and the government only responds if there is a direct threat to its own survival. This makes it easy for the military to have total control as they've had in the past and thus prevents any attempts at reform. It should be interesting to see how well the "democratic" government of Argentina, which took office on January 12, has implemented the program of political dissociation.<|endoftext|>The Canadian women's Olympic football sevens team, for the first time in the squad's history, will be sponsored by Canadian Tire Sports for the duration of the Rio games.

U.S. District Judge Paul S. Gardephe of the Southern District of New York issued an order on Tuesday giving the Treasury Department until February 28 to resolve the issue, Panamanian news site PanamPost reported.

Gardephe, a Democrat, sided with
======================================== SAMPLE 360 ========================================
 warfare, "(the policy of making things worse, in the hope of provoking a crisis and a decisive break with the status quo)" as an existential threat. Any success is likely to be pyrrhic, the author says, la resistance laughing all the way to their mass graves. Witness General Iberico Saint Jean, governor of Buenos Aires during the Terror of 1976, who said, "First we kill all the subversives; then, their collaborators; later, those who sympathize with them; afterward, those who remain indifferent; and finally, the undecided." (p. 403) Sadly, El General was not kidding, promoting a policy of indiscriminate raids, torture, and killings that purged 15-30,000 Argentine lives.Dyer isn't wholly contemptuous of guerilla tactics, he just thinks minimal, anticrime measures sufficient to contain any existential risk to the status quo and thereby promote the survival of our present civilization. Thus, at pp. 415-6, he writes:Quoting Stella Rimington, a former director-general of MI5, armed conflict will be with us for as long as "there are people with grievances." The trick is not to eliminate confrontation, but contain the collateral damage. We are in dire stra

its. But the world has not come to a war and so will not come to a nuclear war. So our only course of action is to be the most responsible citizen possible." The same applies to the current state of the world. As El General believes, the world is "on the verge of a new global conflict"—we are witnessing it now in Syria with regards to Syria—although "it seems to us unlikely that [the situation] will be as dire as in the Sixties, where a handful of countries threatened us all." (Emphasis added). The world is in crisis, but this crisis will be contained and, given the limited resources at our disposal, not necessarily solved. And, as El General writes, "As this crisis draws to a close, it will leave us better prepared for the next one." Thus, "the new century will be one of peace." At this point, El General sees the great global powers, including the United States, "trying to impose on the world as if by sheer force of arms. The end result will, however, be the exact opposite of their intentions." But there is always a price to be paid for global hegemony, which is ultimately the perpetuation of our current existence within the same state-capitalist system. This can be accomplished, of course, in the form of continued economic exploitation. But so much more can be accomplished in other ways, like the promotion of participatory democracy, or in the form of creating mass movements for social change without relying on the state. Or, as El General puts it, "the only way to maintain power is to become a global criminal empire," because "the worst crime of all is failing to maintain the present system of domination. Once the economy has gone into a permanent state of crisis, a new system of power will arise out of the ashes."

"The American empire that is America, a thing we have created with our own hands and not with the help of others, a thing that is an extension of ourselves, is not something that has to leave us to our fate in the process of its creation. On the contrary, the American empire may just be the most precious resource for which we owe our most sacred loyalty—a loyalty as deep as it is wide. It depends upon us for its existence. "The American empire can't go on forever… If in twenty years, no longer able to expand as it did in the twentieth century, it loses its economic and military power, then it would cease to exist." (p. 6)It looks like the end may be nigh, or at least that it is not at hand. What exactly is going on with the American Empire? According to the author of The Collapse of Complex Societies ("a book that will help you to see in retrospect what has taken place historically"), American military power is in terminal crisis of declining relevance and effectiveness to the imperial project in all its guises and manifestations, especially in the Western Hemisphere, which "is where the real wars are being fought, with the United States occupying and occupying and occupying, in Colombia, in the Philippines, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and on the southern tip of the Mexican mainland, and in a wide variety of places around the world." (p. 6). The economic and political interests of multinational corporations have become the dominant drivers of the foreign policy of the United States, as El General describes:It is in foreign affairs, the "crisis of empire as a concept," that El General believes most profoundly illuminates contemporary geopolitical imperatives. He suggests that the "crisis of empire is so big that no nation can possibly hope to understand it or deal with it successfully at the present level of technological ability. This, of course, includes the United States

 non-stop barrage of requests for access after Jackson died.

Jackson drives a dodgem car while hosting a weekend party for underprivileged children at his Neverland ranch in 1994

The singer and ex-wife Lisa Marie Presley welcomed youngsters for World Childrens's Conference at Neverland in 1995

Colony has declined to say what it plans to do with the house, saying only that an answer would come 'in due time', and none of the handful of officials present would speak on the record.

There is speculation it could be turned into a tourist attraction celebrating the King of Pop, much like Elvis Presley's Graceland pays homage to the King of Rock and Roll.


But others ask if it may be restored for his heirs to use, or put on the market to cash in on the sudden interest in all things Jackson.

'I think you can kind of see that in his music. I think there's even more in his lyrics. The hope that he leaves his children a happy place, a loving place. And that's all we ever talk about. It doesn't stop, it never has stopped, so I think you can tell that's really very deep in his heart.


'But at the same time, all of us just want to see them grow up. And you know, he's made it very clear to all of us that he wants the greatest possible visitation with his kids. And so we'll see what comes down from his estate. But at the end of the day, it's the kids that he loves most.

'We all love these kids. We all want to see them make it, to do good in life, and have success in their life, and have all of the experiences they desire.'

The first came on Saturday evening, just before sunset and this time it was raining, I got a good shot, but they didn't want to move. The next time I came by I just missed the second one and didn't get my chance to take any shots from there.<|endoftext|>In a recent post on my blog, I explained the process of generating an array-indexed array from a collection using Java 7 Collections. Today I'm going to show how to do the same thing with a Collection of Vector or List objects, also called a collection-aggregated array.

The reason you might want to do this is because of an old but good Java design pattern, the List Comprehension. Here's an example:

List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Jim", "Bob", "Mary", "Joe"); String order = "First name", "Last name"; ArrayList<String> products; for (String name : names){ products = new ArrayList<>(); } System.out.println(products.toArray());

The array-indexed array is a collection created from one or more elements in a list. In Java, we could use Collections.synchronizedList() to generate the result, but this would be inefficient because it would be creating additional lazy collections and would not work for arrays of multiple elements. Another possibility is to use the Java Collections API's ( Collections.synchronizedArray() , Collections.synchronizedArrayList() , Collections.synchronizedArraySorted() , etc.) but here I'm really demonstrating how to produce an array indexed by a collection (a List of Vectors or Lists).

First, we need to create a list-backed collection or a list-sorted collection. List-backed collections are just collections of things, like in the example above. List-sorted collections may have only one element, or they may have multiple elements, but each item is in one place, for example each item may be an individual Vector or List element.

I'm always a little dubious about lists of Vectors or Loops. In the real world, the loop may return

 love for his family,' Jermaine, 46, said when the video camera was pulled out. 'And now, we have to ask, has it really made sense to do that? Did it really make sense to do what he left behind?'


Jackson is seen looking out over the ranch to the nearby lake from a tree in front of an ocean-glass pool, where he often watched his young children playing in the grass.


It is here, his two granddaughters, Paris and Zoe, are seen hanging out in the back yard of the secret room.

The room was first shown in the 2001 documentary Behind Time: The Life and Music of Michael Jackson, when it was said to be used by the artist's children to store a 'secret stash of cash, a treasure trove of Jackson memorabilia and the occasional cache of illicit drugs'.


The secret room's glass windows look into a back yard where Jackson's daughter Paris and daughter-in-law Paris Jackson, who is Jackson's niece, often hang out

It is understood to have been the location of much of the artist's family art collection, including dozens of paintings by the famous Pop artist including several that would be worth hundreds of million dollars.

After Jackson's death, the house was sold and it was reported that the property was sold in the name of Lisa Marie Presley.

It has since been bought by a trust run by Lisa Marie's children, who have reportedly been granted exclusive rights to rent out the three bedrooms, a half-bath, a large lounge, a guest cottage and a kitchen.

In August last year Jackson's children made the surprise discovery of the secret room, with Paris having to break down the glass door to find out what was inside.

The room was first shown in the 2001 documentary Behind Time: The Life and Music of Michael Jackson, when it was said to be used by the artist's children to store a 'secret stash of cash, a treasure trove of Jackson memorabilia and the occasional cache of illicit drugs'

'I think it was in that room,' said the singer's three-year-old grandson Paris Jackson when he opened the door, 'and he was doing all that stuff, going, "Hey, mommy did this, mommy did that, what?" So the kids were like, "Whoa! Oh my god!"'

The house was bought by Jackson's children, who have reportedly been granted exclusive rights to rent out the three bedrooms, a half-bath and a lounge

The new owner has reportedly handed over the property to the estate's caretaker as Jackson's estate passes on to his children.

But Jackson-affiliated artists and entertainment officials are convinced the property should be allowed to serve a genuine purpose, not just as an investment, like any other Jackson possession.


The house's main entrance was made out to look like a Jackson-designed 'Jackson Sign' and the front door was decorated with Jackson's name and his album 'Thriller' inside.


A number of the family's memorabilia, including a collection of Jackson's photographs and furniture, were placed inside, the Times said.<|endoftext|>The U.K.'s Department of Energy has put a hold on two controversial nuclear reactors being built by SSE and EDF on the island of Hinkley Point.

'He knew there was going to be a storm coming. I think he felt he couldn't say anything, and he's done the right thing by staying in the house.'

His brother, who was born Michael Todd Jackson, has said of the singer: 'If God's not real, then I don't have to be,' the son-of-Jobs told Vanity Fair, in an interview published in February.


Michael Jackson's father Maurice and mother Katherine Jackson also have a home in a gated community called Neverland.

Jackson's house was one of the homes that the entertainer inherited from his famous father and maternal grandparents - but the original name of the estate was 'Stark River'.

Jackson and Presley - who was married to the singer until 1997 - split up in 1980 after just 14 months of marriage and he went off to Hollywood to pursue his acting career.


He then married his second wife Katherine Grant, daughter of a wealthy American family, who is one of his five children, and fathered a son, Xavier Jr, with her. The former couple divorced in 1992, and two years later, in 1995, Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley for a second time.

In 1996 he appeared to be settling down into life as a full-time father by buying the estate on which he had grown up - a small, secluded compound that his mother sold in the mid seventies, but which was kept up until 2001 while he lived in a mansion in Malibu.

He also built Neverland with the help of his sister Katherine in the 1990s, in a former lake that had once belonged to the family and was home to horses, geese and a flock of chickens. The home has 14 rooms and seven bedrooms and has an extensive, landscaped garden.

His home was not the only one he had in the area but is believed to have been the more exclusive of his two homes in the area, and was the place he spent most of his time during the day while travelling between the property in Malibu, or Neverland. It was there too that he shot footage in the infamous 'Thriller' video of himself beating his then-wife Pattie with a guitar.

Jackson's house was one of the homes that the entertainer inherited from his famous father Maurice and maternal grandparents - but the original name of the estate was 'Stark River'

The area, known as Paradise, is just a few miles away from his former home, and is dominated by palm trees and the lush trees that line the lake that surrounds the property

Jackson often worked out of Neverland during the day, before going to practice for his band, the Jackson 5, which he co-founded with his friends Janet Jackson and Lisa Marie, in the evening.

As well as his parents, Jackson had an older brother and twin older sisters. His father died of lung cancer at just 35 in 1971, and his mother died in 1997 of kidney failure.

The singer's father left little money to his brothers and sisters, making the only money for Jackson Sr's younger child - the teenaged Lisa. With his dad's money, she travelled often and was married twice.

When she married in a church - Jackson's wedding was to a priest he was having a relationship with at the time, just a week before the singer's mother died - he was sent to live with Lisa Marie, his sisters and his mother.

Jackson Sr later said: 'My wife and myself split. After her first marriage she stayed with Janet and Lisa Marie, that's how it happened. She ended up being with a man, who took her to a hotel. She got there and didn't

It was reported earlier this month that his late wife Lisa Marie Presley has sold her property in California for $10.8 million (£6.5 million).


As well as this, it's expected her sister Lisa Marie, Jackson's oldest child, also sold her home.

Her father was once said to have spent $1m (£636,000) buying her a $400,000 (£230,000) diamond set.

Just a few miles away a large part of Neverland sits empty - and that includes much of the castle

Meanwhile, the castle - like so many of Jackson's belongings - is left to fade with the passing of time.

The most famous room at Neverland is the bedroom set in an old Victorian wing with an iconic fireplace and gold fixtures.


It is believed the room was originally meant to be one of the king's palaces which would have held dozens of rooms.

The grand house, located on more than 6,000 acres of rolling hills, is known as Neverland because it belonged to the 'princeling' princesses of the fictional land of Neverland.


The castle at the centre of the world is a true piece of American heritage. It has been part of Jackson's family for more than four decades.

For example, the Harvard School of Public Health's latest data show that eating breakfast -- or getting a cup of coffee or tea for adults between the early hours of 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. -- helps reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. Studies have shown that if people start their day with some food, they may enjoy a longer, lighter day.

But

 small country.

Those of German descent make up the largest group, taking up most of the north, central and eastern parts of the country while those with Italian backgrounds live predominately in the south; those of French descent have settled mainly in the west. Not surprisingly, those of the Catholic faith live predominately in the southern and middle parts of the country, due to the influx of those of Italian descent, while those of the Protestant faith live mainly in the rest of the country.

To find out how all these differing groups found a way to get along, the team looked at the geography of the country (mainly mountains and lakes) and how its regions are subdivided. In Switzerland, areas of the country are partitioned into what are known as cantons, which are similar to states in other countries except that each has much more autonomy than is usual. After careful study, the team found that the main reason the groups all manage to get along, is because they are separated from one another. Each canton is comprised of almost all the same types of people, essentially ruling themselves, thus, there is very little overlap. Other areas are separated by lakes or mountains. The end result is that people of differing cultures very seldom run into one another (except
==================== COMPLETION 369 ====================
 at festivals, of course).

The researchers then calculated what percentage of the population would be affected by every ethnic group. They found that if the groups were combined, that the percentage would not significantly differ from 100% as long as the average income of the combined population is not too high. So, when looking at the overall percentage of Swiss are of various ethnic groups, we find an average of 77.5% for Germans (or Germans from all the German regions of Switzerland), 74.6% for Italians and so on.

And even people with a higher income will still find they are able to meet others living in different parts of the country. The number of German Swiss living in the southwest of the country is just below the German percentage for the general population, as are the percentage of French in the southern German areas. The same holds true for the French in the southwest, and so forth.

These findings come from people from an ethnically diverse country of approximately 8.5 million, which is home to an average of about 100 languages spoken.

So, next time you want to visit Switzerland, don't try to impress the locals by speaking German… unless you want to be known for one of the greatest misunderstandings in history:

Bonus Facts:

A recent article has been circulating the web claiming that Switzerland has been the home to the Swiss army since 1813, when the Swiss Confederation was formed. While the Swiss Army was in existence at that time, it was a volunteer branch rather of a regular army. Since then, it has been a part of the regular army for the majority of its existence, with some exceptions in the late twentieth century.

The Swiss population, of course, has long been known to be some of the wealthiest populations in the world thanks to this large amount of money being sent home from overseas annually to ensure that everyone can live in a decent quality of life. If there is anything that is not quite as good as $8.6 billion a year coming in to Swiss bank accounts, it is that Swiss people seem to be able to spend more time outside the country, which can be attributed to the large portion of the Swiss population living in mountain regions as opposed to the urban areas.

The Swiss government was founded in 1791 and is also called the Kingdom of Cantons. They are the 7th largest state in the entire world.

Switzerland has an enormous variety of currencies, from the two time-honored marks, the Swiss franc to the euro to the most recent Swiss franc, the Swiss franc.

This is a truly tragic moment, and it has led to the highest suicide rate for boys in a generation, an all-time high for suicide among American males 15-24, a 50-year increase in the number of women taking their own lives, and an increasing number of young people taking their own lives each year.

We've been talking about this for a long time, ever since the first suicide note was discovered in an Ivy League campus library, not long after a young man jumped off a university dorm building, killing himself and his girlfriend with a shotgun.

We've been discussing this for a long time because those people were young and their experiences were often isolated, often tragic, often filled with anxiety and isolation. But this trend is not confined to a select few universities, this trend is a national epidemic, affecting everyone in the age group from adolescence to their mid-20s, and those in their 30s and 40s.

==================== COMPLETION 370 ====================
 perhaps in major public events, like sports events) which allows the language barrier to stay largely out of account (at least for those from the same country) making for a very stable society.

The study was made possible by collecting data from an extensive database of people called the Federal Population Database (Bureau für Verfassungsschutz, BVV). Using this data, the researchers were able to create a map showing what groups called each other names in Switzerland (the data used to create this map was obtained by a computerised search through more than 1,500 million words collected by a Swiss linguistic database called Tandem, and the BVV), with names referring to other languages. In the final version of the study (published in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology) the map showed, for example, that all of the word "Switzerland" refers to all of Germany, while the word "Austria" refers to a certain place in Germany, and so on.

This fascinating study illustrates that there is really no reason why a large country with disparate groups would necessarily run into conflict and is further evidence of what is known as "the universality of human culture". Not just any culture will be able to function when separated from others, but as the researchers point out, "language barriers and other external constraints can often override or negate cultural differences, even in societies with common origins or historical events."

Shelby County Circuit Judge Brian Jackson rejected arguments from state officials and the Alabama Supreme Court last week that the proposed new law, Senate Bill 56, does not violate the U.S. Constitution. In his order, Jackson wrote that the ACLU's lawyers did not have standing to bring the civil rights lawsuit and asked for the judge to reconsider the order and the proposed ban, which would prohibit same-sex couples from marrying unless their marriages were first approved by one of the plaintiffs' parents or children.

But the ACLU's lawyers did win the ability to be heard on Monday on the other side of the same lawsuit filed in an Alabama federal court last month. U.S. District Judge Callie Granade dismissed all claims and granted an injunction ordering the state to recognize all marriages that have occurred since the law was passed in March of 2014.

"A judge has never overturned an Alabama marriage law in a case with nothing more than these plaintiffs and their lawyers can claim because of a state court in Georgia struck down a similar law the same year," said Ryan Kiesel, legal director of ACLU of Alabama. "Yet Georgia has no such marriage protections. What this judge's order says is that the Supreme Court needs to intervene because Alabama's law is different."

The Alabama law would essentially put same-sex married couples, regardless of gender, on an even playing field among same-sex couples who have opposite-sex spouses. Alabama defines a marriage as being between only "one man and one woman."

"Alabama can't tell one man or woman who they can marry just because they want to marry," said Matthew Staver, Senior Counsel of Liberty Counsel, who also represented plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit. "This is the most egregious violation of the rights of all Alabama citizens and the states' constitutional rights of same-sex couples. It's the same old story from courts

==================== COMPLETION 371 ====================
 where they cross into the country from Italy, for example), thus they rarely cross paths.

The team also looked at the types of work people did. They found that while some industries, like oil and gas and manufacturing, do not particularly favor Germans with Italian heritage, the other industries, such as tourism and education, more or less do (there are exceptions though).

The researchers wrote:

The Swiss system in general works well on the national level and has provided a solid foundation for German-Italian relations and intercultural cooperation at the national level in a time when the nation has been dealing with the economic collapse of its traditional partners and with an increasing number of people from other cultures.

The study revealed that the Swiss enjoy relatively strong levels of trust among other people around them, with Germans finding friends in particular all across the nation. The Swiss enjoy higher levels of satisfaction from social relationships among their peers than people on other nationalities.

When a new Swiss resident joins a school for their children, for example, they expect their child will have a good friendship with Germans, who also make up 20% of the school population.

Overall, those of Italian heritage have no difficulties in finding friends, with Germans being the most popular national group that residents get along with.

However, the study also says that for other ethnicities, including Russians, French, British and Irish, the level of trust and relationship satisfaction varies dramatically because people from different national backgrounds have a great deal in common.

The team said that the reason many of the other groups feel at home in Switzerland is because it is so multicultural (which it is).

To conclude, the report said that those of Italian heritage and other nationalities who are living in Switzerland have an especially good relationship with Swiss, Germans and Italians.

Swiss is a wonderful mix of cultures and people, and this study gives us a very good chance to understand why.<|endoftext|>The number of refugees and migrants on the move in Germany has almost doubled this year to more than 5,200, with many families and unaccompanied children making their way to the country.

A total of 49,100 refugee cases were filed on January 1, more than in even the worst winter months of 2015 and 2016.

More than half of those arriving, including at least 3,000 children, come from a war-torn camp in Syria known as "Aleppo", and they come mainly from Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The latest numbers from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) show the huge spike in numbers has coincided with Germany's decision to open its borders to the flood of refugees fleeing war and violence in Syria.

Many of those arriving in Germany say their main aim on arrival is to reunite with loved ones they left behind.

Among the Syrians are the father of two boys, aged four and 18, who are staying at a refugee hostel near Frankfurt. The man, who asked that only his first name be used, says that his two sons have been waiting in Syria for months and that he fears his oldest is too traumatised to make his way to Germany.

"I am very worried because at least one of my sons can stay with me until the end of the war. But he has been injured in a conflict which has never left him," he told The Independent. "A child injured by shelling, I can barely comprehend how to look him in the eye. And my other son is almost killed at these refugees camp."

The father said it was difficult to take care of his son in Syria.

The end result is that people of differing cultures very seldom run into one another (except
==================== COMPLETION 372 ====================
 perhaps on the ski slopes) and each canton has their own distinct way of living, which is extremely useful in terms of communication and cross-cultural understanding of problems.

In terms of geography, the north is mostly a forested and mountainous landscape that extends to the sea as far south as Salzburg and the Carinthian Alps of the north west. The central part of the country, in contrast, is a land of lakes (especially the lower Rhine), that are relatively untouched and which the cantons are only slightly connected to by lakes. In the south, the countryside is mostly lowlands (with mountains at higher latitudes), with few lakes and relatively little forest. In the north, there are also lakes and high valleys. In the middle region, people tend to be quite homogeneous. The researchers even managed to map on their interactive maps, how much of each kind of country was divided along the borders of cantons. The answer? Well, they calculated that there is a total of 8,450,000 km. divided up between the cantons - the largest section being the 4.5 million km. of border land.

There are no clear conclusions as to which country would be best suited to one particular religion. Some countries are better than others, like Switzerland, which is probably a better choice for Catholics due to the country's cultural tolerance and separation from all other countries, including those with a Catholic majority. The results also may be interesting for how Christianity evolves in a state-like country with only three religions. It was observed that in the Swiss cantons, religious diversity is higher as compared to the rest of Switzerland (see Figure 5). In the northern parts, Catholics dominate the country, but in the southern and western parts, Protestants still predominate. Catholics are also divided on the same level in Germany; they mostly live in Germany's large states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg.

Figure 5. The different religious communities as defined by the Swiss census based on their ethnic identity - in blue, Catholic; in grey, Protestant; in red, Muslim.

As with so many things in society, religion is influenced by the environment in which it flourishes. For example, Christians tend to have greater religious belief when living near hills or mountains so that they can keep an eye on them and they can avoid temptations. This is also true of religious affiliation. For instance, Muslims living in the mountain regions of western Switzerland are more likely to be religious when they live near mountains than when they are in the country's most urban areas, such as in the south of the country. This may be a contributing factor to the high suicide rate of those who live on the slopes and in the city.

ella). If we immunize most children, but not all, then the incidence of the disease will drop and those people not immunized will be less likely to develop the disease as a child and more likely to develop it as adults when it is dangerous. In essence, for a small portion of the population we would be shifting the risk of chicken pox from childhood to adulthood and increasing the mortality from chicken pox!

Therefore, if the vaccine afforded protection for life, there would be a very strong argument in favor of universal vaccination -- no chicken pox and no shingles. Both children and adults would benefit -- children would not develop chicken pox as children or shingles as adults and no adults would be vulnerable to chicken pox as adults.

But what would happen if the vaccine only protected a person for 25 years? Should we worry that we will push off chicken pox in the entire population from childhood when it is benign to adulthood when it can be deadly? While boosters can be given, realistically, many people will never receive the booster and these people would have been better off developing the disease as a child.

The vaccine has been in use for 25 years in Japan with continued resistance. We can only hope that lifelong resistance can be
==================== COMPLETION 373 ====================
 overcome when the time comes. To me the main problem here is with our culture. How should the population respond to this revelation that the vaccination may cause death? If we can make a difference in saving a few lives (especially for individuals who will live with the damage for a long time) it does not really matter whether the vaccine was initially intended to make many people sick. At the end of the day every life counts.

When I was in middle school, I fell heavily under the spell of Oreo cookies, having them before every class and before going to sleep. The cookie's chocolatey filling was addictive, and the fact that they couldn't be bought at the convenience store or the drugstore had me falling for it even more.

But my eating habits didn't really go under control for several years. At one point I could not remember how many cookies I had eaten. It felt like I had no willpower. Sometimes, when my hunger drove me to the cookie counter while in the middle of class, I would just eat the ones I could get at the end because that was all I could physically manage.

Not long after high school I was an aspiring doctor and ended up working as a full-time receptionist. I could work with only three hours of sleep a night, and when I worked nights, I was exhausted and barely felt like myself. But I continued with my Oreo eating habit as I spent more and more time working, and I couldn't get enough. But I also couldn't imagine my life without it in it.

I did come to the realization in college that I was addicted to Oreos, and I was determined to kick my habit. Oreos were one of my favorite snacks because they could be bought anywhere. Plus they are easy to eat and I don't have to worry about making them while I am driving or working.

ella). If we immunize most children, but not all, then the incidence of the disease will drop and those people not immunized will be less likely to develop the disease as a child and more likely to develop it as adults when it is dangerous. In essence, for a small portion of the population we would be shifting the risk of chicken pox from childhood to adulthood and increasing the mortality from chicken pox!

Therefore, if the vaccine afforded protection for life, there would be a very strong argument in favor of universal vaccination -- no chicken pox and no shingles. Both children and adults would benefit -- children would not develop chicken pox as children or shingles as adults and no adults would be vulnerable to chicken pox as adults.

But what would happen if the vaccine only protected a person for 25 years? Should we worry that we will push off chicken pox in the entire population from childhood when it is benign to adulthood when it can be deadly? While boosters can be given, realistically, many people will never receive the booster and these people would have been better off developing the disease as a child.

The vaccine has been in use for 25 years in Japan with continued resistance. We can only hope that lifelong resistance can be
==================== COMPLETION 374 ====================
 overcome in some people (though that would be wonderful, even if it is impossible).

If we are not concerned with the incidence of shingles in adult populations because the vaccine protected children for 25 years, then what is the reason not to use the chicken pox vaccine in adults? The reason that I do not believe shingles should be given a lifetime immunization is that the shingles vaccine does not prevent disease. It prevents recurrences after the initial episode -- a serious and disabling condition. Therefore, as soon as one recurs, the vaccine can no longer stop the disease. If we had a vaccine that was truly effective against shingles, then if one recurs, we would not have any need to give a booster, even if the individual is immunocompromised with immunosuppressants or chemotherapy.

This brings up the second major concern: the risk to the vaccinated person. If we stop the vaccination and allow the disease to reoccur, will the patient be worse off? People don't like the diseases they receive from the vaccine and it takes time for them to adjust to the fact that they are being protected. If that protection is to expire within 25 years, what becomes of it? Will there be someone who will get shingles within 25 years, become vaccinated and be worse off in the process? I would say it is highly unlikely but not impossible. We have no real scientific knowledge about what happens in an immuno-compromised adult and in an immunocompromised child. We don't know if the immunization will work and if some portion of the vaccine will remain and the child will develop the disease; in the course of development we are constantly making mistakes.

My best guess as to how the vaccine would affect the individual is that a vaccine that protects against a disease and that is given for 25 years will be more successful at preventing the disease in those who are vaccinated than in those who were not vaccinated. However, most vaccines are given for 2-4 years and it would be impossible to determine where in that range the vaccine would be more or less successful. However, with the shingles vaccine, we do know that in most people the disease recurs even after repeated treatments with corticosteroids. If the vaccine is given for 25 years, it could very well be that it can be effective at preventing the recurrence of the disease and the disease itself can be curable.

So if shingles is so dangerous, why is it given to children and adults?

In my opinion, the answer lies in the fact that it has been scientifically proven to have little or no mortality in children up to age 15 (though it can cause major disability or even death in very young adults). For those people who are more affected by developing this disease, we should start with the vaccine for children, then later increase the vaccine as children age. It would be difficult to prevent shingles for children from ages 5-15, but we could prevent shingles in adulthood.

If we use the chicken pox vaccine for children and in an attempt to avoid the shingles vaccine, do you think the number of the shingles cases would remain essentially equal across the country as compared to places where the vaccine has been used? The chicken pox vaccination was shown to protect as many as 90% of those who get it from shingles. If we use the chicken pox vaccine for children, there are likely to still be some cases of shingles in places where we used to have the chicken pox vaccination and in places where we would still have the chicken pox vaccination. Therefore, I am against the use of chicken pox to vaccinate for shingles.

Infectious Diseases

Babies are born with a high risk for catching many different infections. However, it is important to remember that only about half of those infections that will have an impact on an infant's outcome are life-threatening. For example, only 15% of chicken pox is fatal to about 30% or less of those infected.

There are at least 15 different kinds of infections that affect babies in the first two years of their lives, some of which can be potentially fatal such as pneumonia, measles, toxoplasmosis, and others without as great an impact such as gastroenteritis. Infants are particularly vulnerable to complications with many illnesses and infections are the main reason that many babies with diarrhea are seen at the hospital or in the NICU. Infants who have complications have increased risk for death and many of these complications can be prevented and treated with antibiotics or early vaccinations.

The following list includes specific infectious diseases that can be deadly in young children.

Gardens are not a "natural" environment for pathogens to grow and to create infectious disease outbreaks and disease vectors, like mosquitoes. While you may not be exposed to diseases from a garden, you are exposed to them from the garden of the people you share your home with. So, while you cannot control all illnesses from your garden, we think it is important to be aware of the various germs that may be present in your garden and the places where you may have come in contact with them.

In some climates, insects, like mosquitoes, do not live in complete darkness and do not go into a deep sleep as easily. So, some people who are exposed to insects may come in contact with pathogens, like the mosquito that carries the Zika virus, and may actually become infected. These are not the conditions from which you would need to be vaccinated.

Cough and colds are common childhood diseases. However, the majority of colds are not life threatening, and most children who get a cold do not develop symptoms. If you are concerned that you or a family member has had a cold in the last 2 months, you should see your doctor and discuss your symptoms. You should also see a family doctor who can tell you about the potential side effects of getting a cold and the need to see a doctor immediately if you have a fever.

It is common during infancy and childhood to get strep throat, sore throats, and bronchitis. These common diseases will go away in a few days if you catch them early and get plenty of rest and antibiotics. However, if you are not exposed to strep (or a cough or cold virus) you can develop these disease. For example, if you are not immunized against these bacteria and are in child care, you can develop pneumonia if you sit on an overcrowded bed next door to people who are sick and are in the same room. It is important to get some rest -- and possibly antibiotics -- if you think you have a cold, throat or strep throat.

Some of the diseases in this list are the reasons parents get some of the vaccines recommended. The disease must be present or it cannot be prevented through a vaccine. If you have a child with a particular disease, it is important to find out what diseases are currently most common in any part of the world you

That said, the flavors of the whiskey are there from the get go with the citrus peels to the vanilla and molasses, and while there's some fruitiness there, it doesn't really stick with the flavor. As a whole, it's not all that bad of a drink. I'm sure people will love this more than I do.

If you enjoy the darker American Whiskey that's been popular in recent years, then you'll probably like this one. If not, then you're more likely to find yourself passing on it and taking a chance on something else.

One thing that did catch my attention with this one, from tasting notes that I read, and I'm paraphrasing here here, is it seems the brand uses "high-quality distilled red wine" in its mashbill, which gives it a wine-like flavor, but with less alcohol than what you'd typically find used in the mashbill for a whiskey of the same ABV.

I'm not sure you would be able to tell that this isn't Bourbon, but I can't make any claims for taste or overall flavor character whatsoever.

The "High-quality distilled red wine mashbill" is, as they say, a "distinctly delicious flavor" that may take some experimenting to uncover.<|endoftext|>A few weeks back, I wrote a post called 4 Reasons Why You Should Never Get Married in 2017.

Just a slight bit sweet with that cornbread and a hint of that caramel and coffee that I know all to well. The only reason this one didn't get more thumbs up, then, is that it's too sweet, and more than a little too sweet. Still a very good, affordable, enjoyable Alabama-style whiskey!

Aperitif

Alabama Whiskey

92 Proof, Approx. $29 retail

Rating: Good Stuff*

This was one of the most interesting bottles on hand. Aperitif, I believe, is a cocktail created at the B.B. King's Bar, which uses a mixture of whiskey and brandy. The drink combines the flavor and texture of a drink like a Manhattan with the crispness of a Martini, and the sweetness of a Ciro's. Pretty standard stuff, but one that was quite unique on the shelf. If I'm wrong, I'll be happy to be proved wrong, as I don't actually drink Ciro's that often.

Aperitif's nose is interesting, smelling like a gin and tonic blended with that old, old school apple juice flavor, which doesn't sound terrible at first, but is actually kind of unpleasant. There are hints of apple, cinnamon, honey and an almost minty quality to the nose. The flavor of Aperitif is pretty standard apple, cinnamon and bourbon.

This one also has notes of oak on the palate, a bit woody, not overpowering, but it doesn't have the same crispness of the nose, and instead tastes like a watered down Old Fashioned. A more balanced version of the typical Aperitif would have included a little of each of the oak notes, but, again, this one is just too sweet.

The only thing I didn't like about Aperitif is that the alcohol by volume is too low. At only 89.6 proof versus 98.4 proof, you might assume that this is over-proofed, but there's more than a trace of sugar in there. One could imagine that it's sweet-sour, like your average cheap cognac, but that isn't the case, which I think is a real shame.

So there you have it:

Four different brands I sampled in Alabama whiskey. Four different options. Four very different, very good offerings from four very different companies in Alabama.

You can learn more about B.B. King's, the distiller of these whiskeys, at this location.

And, for those of you who like this kind of thing, here are links to B.B. King's sites with a little more bourbon info.

It's also worth mentioning that the company seems to be working on a bourbon that's quite different from this one.

I've had my doubts about this, but with more recent distilleries coming in and out of the state, I'm starting to think that maybe this is actually a good bourbon. The nose is very sweet, with a lot of dark oak. It's the kind of nose you'd get from a younger bourbon. There's some vanilla, but it's still very sweet. It's a bit of a dry bourbon, and it's not necessarily my style. If you liked A-1, you might like this. If not, it just doesn't seem terribly interesting to me.

It's pretty much the same nose as their first release, so it's not surprising. I think it's got just a good smoky character, and some notes of vanilla, like from a younger Bourbon H. This is better for those who can appreciate the complexity of Bourbon H. But it's still a good whiskey and I expect it to sell well.

Chateau Ste. Michelle Bourbon

A nice touch about the labeling: no branding is visible. Still, it's not a very obvious whiskey for me. The nose is a nice smoky bourbon, but the more I sniff this, the more it seems like it might be another Bourbon H. That doesn't seem fair of me, so it'll have to go in the "Worst of" category in my book. If you're looking for a Kentucky bourbon, this probably fits that bill, but the marketing will probably make you turn off the nose, because it could all be really good.

It seems like I'm getting better at detecting flavors in bourbons. There are a few interesting and delicious notes throughout. The nose is heavy with toffee and some dark fruit. I'm getting notes of vanilla, and I would think the oak might be coming from bourbon as opposed to another barrel. Overall, it doesn't really fit the Bourbon H category, but maybe it's just a case of me getting better with every bottle.

Crafting Basic tools requires the use of several components to be crafted. These items can be found with the crafting recipes by default, and can be added by players in the creative mode. However, an additional component is required to craft specific tools as they depend on the components used to craft them.


The crafting of some parts is determined by the recipe for the tool itself. Tools will not be built unless they are built from one of the required materials; that is, a furnace, smelter, or furnace and pickaxe are required to build a pick.

Each of the components are given a numerical value, which is the difficulty in creating the item (from 1 to 10). In short, tools with greater values are harder to craft.


All the components will be available to Craft using the left tool, but some will not. To create them, first use the left mouse button and then click again for a free slot. For example, to add a redstone wire to build a tool, use the right mouse button (to add wires to a furnace recipe, use the right mouse button and click on the furnace). To build a wire-building tool (with the redstone wire) without adding a tool, left click and hold the left mouse button. This will allow the current slot, currently empty, to empty. Left clicking without holding the key will build a tool for that number.

Below is an example of a tool with 5 parts, all of which are listed above, and the number of each needed to craft it:

Tool Required Components Tool 1 pickaxe Tool 1 wire Tool 2 redstone wire Tool 3 redstone wire

If a certain tool is already made, only the components will be unlocked, not any other pieces. For example, the pickaxe has only 2 parts, but two of them are required (2 x pickaxe = 5 in this case), which is the same as if you only had one pickaxe in inventory.

Tools can be combined into larger, more valuable, items (including the pickaxe) as well. By placing two identical tools together, they can be built and used as each other has many pieces, and thus can have an increased power. In this case, each has only 1 piece added, so it can't build another tool. The tool's power and durability are doubled, however, so this only works for certain combinations. The amount each gets multiplied is dependent on the combination's power (higher is more), but also how many pieces are also used, which has an increased chance of getting higher levels of the product.

Note about pickaxes: if you just need one, don't combine them - it will make more of them. Instead, combine the redstone cables to the end of the pick.

Tools with less parts than the last one used will no longer be crafted with the corresponding tools, which are listed here.

In the Sundarbans, the extremely disproportionate risks and returns of the shrimp industry became visible through the muddiest of all waters. Most shrimp from coastal countries in the Global South comes at prices which do not account for the hidden socio-ecological costs, ranging from destroying fragile ecosystems to promoting slave labor.

The story of shrimp is a relatively recent one. Commercial shrimp aquaculture, primarily for exports, has been promoted across the Global South since the mid-1970s by governments and international institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, shrimp now has the second highest value in seafood trade , after salmon, and its production is projected to continue growing in the next decade.

While EU efforts have had limited success — particularly in Europe — a few EU countries, such as France, have made some progress in improving their environment and water quality. But many EU countries, including the UK and Germany, remain resistant to change, despite calls for reform from NGOs and even the EU itself.

These countries are not alone. In the Global South, shrimp production is driven by the poor and the rural. But despite a large body of evidence, government efforts focused on environmental protection and human rights tend to fall short, to the detriment of the shrimp industry.

"Shrimp is one of the most destructive things people eat," says Advert

Shrimp is the world's second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. This makes it particularly problematic for the poor. The International Labour Organization (ILO) says 40 percent of these gases come from the land where shrimp farms are located. As climate change worsens, the shrimp industry will face increasing competition from alternative forms of protein production that are less reliant on fossil fuels. For poor people and coastal communities, this means a loss of livelihoods.

'Shrimp is one of the most destructive things people eat,' says Maanar Khan, a farmer from the Gulf Coast town of Oudomsari. "If there's no shrimp, our local economy suffers because we don't sell this food and our family has no income."

When shrimp is in demand, however, it causes huge environmental and social costs. According to the ILO, the direct economic costs of shrimp production account for around 1.3 percent of global GHG emissions. Emissions due to shrimp farming tend to outweigh those caused by transport and energy consumption.

The most widespread economic costs associated with shrimp are direct ones: the massive quantities of fossil fuels needed for factory farms and transportation, the destruction of fragile ecosystems that require large expanses of water in order to grow shrimp for human consumption, and the need to transport the shrimp themselves in unseaworthy vessels with limited capacity.

Other indirect costs are the displacement of entire families due to environmental degradation, and deaths due to disease and exposure to harmful chemicals. All of these are directly linked to the industry.

The impacts of the industry are also felt in coastal areas. Many countries, particularly in the Global South, have banned export of shrimp and imported seafood because of environmental and human rights impacts.

The problem is not confined to the waters and countries of the Global South. In Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore, shrimp is an important source of protein for their poor populations. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that about 40 million people are dependent on shrimp production in the Asia Pacific region.

These countries are no exception. The Philippines is one of the biggest shrimp suppliers in the world. It feeds more than half of the 100 million people who live in the southeast region of the country. Nearly all of the country's shrimp is imported, with the remainder grown locally or in its neighboring islands.

With rising incomes and food consumption, more middle class families can afford shrimp, which makes the industry more profitable but carries additional risks. The ILO cites a risk of water pollution from shrimp farming. In Vietnam, shrimp is particularly polluted, but a recent investigation in the Philippines revealed that shrimp from poor and remote areas of rural areas is even more polluted.

In the Sundarbans, the extremely disproportionate risks and returns of the shrimp industry became visible through the muddiest of all waters. Most shrimp from coastal countries in the Global South comes at prices which do not account for the hidden socio-ecological costs, ranging from destroying fragile ecosystems to promoting slave labor.

Value for whom?

The story of shrimp is a relatively recent one. Commercial shrimp aquaculture, primarily for exports, has been promoted across the Global South since the mid-1970s by governments and international institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, shrimp now has the second highest value in seafood trade , after salmon, and its production is projected to continue growing in the next decade.

In 2015, the US and the European Union were the two largest importers of shrimp. The
==================== COMPLETION 382 ====================
 European Union's imports accounted for around one fifth of the global shrimp supply. The US imported more than 50 million metric tonnes (MMT) of shrimp in 2015. In some countries in Southern Asia, such as Sri Lanka, shrimp is particularly prized as a source of marine live food.

On the other hand, shrimp farming has taken a heavy toll on the oceans. The main culprit is land-based runoff, because of which more than 500 rivers in Sri Lanka are classified as 'high pollution' for the sake of pollution to shrimp beds. This has serious effects on species such as fish, freshwater turtles and dugong which depend on the water bodies.

The consequences of shrimp farming's destructive processes are more visible at inland areas where water levels and vegetation are less susceptible. In this regard, even the Sundarbans seems to be a victim.

The Sundarbans in a nutshell

Landlocked in Sri Lanka due to mountains, mountains that are also the home of the Sundarbans, it is only possible for tourists to reach this beautiful natural landscape through the Chittagong Hills or by boat. It seems that the area is mostly a playground for locals. While it is well-known for its wildlife and wildlife breeding, the Sundarbans remains largely unexplored territory, with the main focus being shrimp farms.

In 2009, the World Bank launched the "Save Sundarbans Initiative" to help people in the area to control local pollution. At the time, the project coordinator said the initiative had the potential to change conditions in the region "to provide an example of sustainable development for the whole Southeast Asian region." And indeed it has worked.

But at what cost?

The shrimp population exploded in recent years. It started with around 1,000 million kilograms (Kg) and now covers an area of 2 million hectares. While the World Bank acknowledges the benefits of shrimp farming, it admits that this is not enough to meet the food demands in countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, where the growing demand for shrimp is increasing the demand for land use. The project acknowledges that this increase in demand is pushing some land users towards destructive practices such as dredging, as it pushes them to remove water bodies and create artificial habitats for shrimp.

Meanwhile, there is little agreement on ways to improve the health of the entire river ecosystem, with both experts and farmers admitting that the most sustainable way to feed the global shrimp population is to protect and preserve the Sundarbans.

Environmental problems, especially related to shrimp farming, are increasingly being discussed in international forums, particularly with respect to the environment. The Sundarbans has been ranked by the World Bank as one of its top ten Priority Environment Goals. The World Bank will be discussing its priorities in this regard during the 2016 UN Climate Change Summit in Paris.

The Sundarbans: a lesson from global shrimp farming

Globalizing the shrimp industry meant making the environment as important as the economics of shrimp production, and vice versa.

If shrimp are the poster boy for what is wrong with economic globalization, then the Sundarbans has become a poster boy for what is right. The Sundarbans has an abundance of life, of species such as dugong, birds, sea turtles, dolphins, leopards, and turtles. It also supports some of the poorest communities in Sri Lanka, with people working alongside the shrimp industry in many ways. Some of the greatest risks faced by the environment are also associated with shrimp farming.

Dredging is the most obvious environmental hazard in the Sundarbans' water bodies, although it has also destroyed habitat for some species. Dredging also causes sedimentation, which is of particular concern because sedimentation is a major factor

==================== COMPLETION 383 ====================
 two largest users are China and Indonesia . China is the largest consumer of shrimp (over $5bn annually), and this figure increases to $7.7bn annually for Indonesia and $7.6bn annually for the US. Japan, Argentina and Brazil are also significant importers, as are some African countries. Asia accounts for approximately half of global shrimp production.

The seafood industry has attracted significant public debate: whether this is the cause of over-fishing, over-development, climate change or an economic failure and public health hazard have all been hotly debated since the first commercial aquaculture venture began operating in the UK in 1972.

Environmental impact

But the impact of shrimp on water quality, aquatic ecosystems and the climate is not the concern of aquaculture: the real fear of aquaculture is over-fishing from a loss of natural resources.

With the average population, about three thousand million, the number of people capable of harvesting shrimp is huge. And the number of fisheries is growing, especially in the Global North. The number of waters being actively considered for aquaculture in the Global South is decreasing fast: in 2013, there was only one such fishery in the Southern Indian Ocean (SIO).

The world is now experiencing the first shrimp aquaculture crisis – one of many to come, especially as global demand for seafood grows dramatically. This makes it increasingly important to understand how aquaculture is affecting the local community, and the human-environment links between the industries, fisheries and human health, all of which affect ocean and coastal health.<|endoftext|>An Ottawa man living in the U.S. illegally will be expelled from Canada under an immigration policy change the Liberal government announced in mid-October.

"We have received notice that a decision has been made to remove the visa," said a representative for Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen at a media briefing on Friday.

The decision comes amid increasing criticism of Canada's immigration policy in the United States following the election of Donald Trump to the White House. Immigration groups have argued Ottawa should also take a more hard-edged approach to the issue of Canada-U.S. relations.

"It has become very clear to me that the United States is not willing to have a constructive conversation about immigration with Canadians," Hussen said.

Asked if Canadians would face additional scrutiny as a result, the minister seemed to suggest the U.S. may be inching closer to doing just that.

"This is just the beginning and we will continue to work with the US authorities to address this matter and bring those who pose a threat to Canada into the system ... this is not something which will be swept under the rug and swept under the mat."

Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen says his department will continue to work with U.S. authorities with respect to a decision to expel a Canadian. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

In a statement, the U.S. embassy in Ottawa said it welcomes "the opportunity to work with the government of Canada on these matters. Our countries share an important border, and we have a responsibility to jointly protect it. We are looking forward to learning more from our Canadian counterparts."

Hussen said his department will continue to work with the U.S. authorities with respect to a decision to expel a Canadian, stressing no Canadian is required to explain or justify their status or status when they enter the United States.

Canada has issued thousands of temporary residence permits to people with temporary protected status, or TRP.

Shrimp production in Southeast Asia (SEA) now totals around 600 million tons a year, according to the UN's UN Food and Agriculture Organization. While Indonesia and Malaysia are the two largest shrimp producing countries, Thailand currently has the second largest share of global shrimp production at 80 million tons. More surprising is that Thailand consumes up to 80 percent of the shrimp it farms in Vietnam and Hong Kong. Thailand's large share is a direct result of its low tariffs, a status it shares with Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, and the UAE.

These policies mean that Thai exports and imports reach a fraction of the total production of the countries where they enter and the cost of shrimp are set high in comparison to the rest of the seafood market. The price in Thailand is set at just 5.6% of the global market of around 6.5% for shrimp, despite that the shrimp industry accounts for almost 50% of Thailand's export. In comparison, the cheapest global price for shrimp is 6.8%.

Sustainability is often forgotten

As a result of this low-cost trade, it is often easy for the shrimp industry to disregard the costs created by the environmental impact, labor abuse, and climate change which the shrimp industry brings to the table. The industry is also a particularly poor example in addressing issues of human dignity and protecting vulnerable populations.

But despite its low price, the impact is still substantial. This includes, not least, the tremendous environmental damage caused by the water and land shrimp is spread on or the impact of the shrimp industry itself on the livelihoods of local communities. The effects on sea life are also significant, with over half of the world's species of sea cucumbers being threatened with extinction.

What is required is an urgent re-think of shrimp production on a global scale, and especially in countries where fishing populations are under pressure. Only by understanding fully the cost of shrimp and how to fix the system so that it does not lead to such extreme and disproportionate environmental impacts, can we hope to ensure greater social and economic equity for fisherfolk rather than simply further enriching the coastal elite.

"Some guys still try to be manly and try to be like strong and stuff, but you know personally I'm not afraid to show my vulnerability because being vulnerable or being sensitive is not a weakness."

Older generations of Japanese men are not happy about the changes. At a bar frequented by businessmen after work, one man said: "You need to be carnivorous when you make decisions in your life. You should be proactive, not passive."

Fukasawa said the group does not care so much about making money -- a quality tied to the fact that there are fewer jobs available during the current global economic recession.

In social situations, friends, coworkers, and family members can be as triggering of anxiety as the sight of a person's eyes (which are the number one trigger). In fact, in the presence of family members in particular, anxiety often increases.

This is due to two reasons. First, people are often present as a means of protecting each other. For instance, if you had bad news from a family member or a friend, you would go to them first. If your family member were to walk by a random person, you would instinctively stop to avoid getting struck. The presence of your family member does the same in my experience.

Second, our bodies communicate an emotion and feelings directly to our mind when we are around others. This is how we feel comfortable in social situations. We don't need an external trigger to know it's not a good thing to make eye contact with someone we are not fond of.

It's difficult to explain in words, but when I feel the anxiety rising, I know I have to go out and make eye contact with that person for whatever reason.

I know this feels weird at first. But after a while you'll get used to it. The reason the first round is so difficult is because when people see you, you feel like a "non normal," a "different" person, someone who is weird, "strange" or a "freak." I also know this anxiety is not new. It was just brought into focus by the fact that you are seeing me right now.

How does this work to trigger anxiety?

As someone who is very self conscious, I've had to get used to a "wander" posture. I walk a lot in the public. I take public transportation as frequently as possible.

If you have not been on public transit in your life, imagine what it must be like to be that person. You're out on your way to work, it's sunny and there's no traffic, and your boss tells you to meet him downstairs. What would you do? Where will you go and how will you get there?

You might take the public transportation that day. That's the safe strategy for you. It's very likely you will not be in that situation all day, as traffic can be bad in the city.

But you might also go to a subway station. You might try to find a bus route that's close to your office, work, or home. You might walk your dog because you know a local dog walker likes the neighborhood. You might see a local farmer's market and decide you'd rather eat fresh vegetables than meat that was cooked the night before.

Most people are probably going to walk in this situation.

The idea of sitting out and watching this person you "supposedly" hate in the park is terrifying. You realize that you have to do something to make this person feel comfortable and you can't just do it by yourself.

And that feeling of isolation, the thought of not being part of the public realm, makes you feel alone and terrified.

The country exports nearly three million tonnes of fresh cheese annually and also imports significant quantities of processed cheese. In 2017, UK imports of processed cheese amounted to 4.8 million tonnes — a 6% increase on the previous year.

UK cheeses and dairy products are used in the production of other food products in the country, including pies and confectioneries, cakes, chocolates, chocolate bars and biscuits, and also in the supply of frozen dairy products such as ice cream, frozen custard, sorbet and ice puddings. On the cheese front, the country produces a varied range of cheeses, mainly from the North and the Fens, which are all highly regarded locally for its distinctive taste and texture.

A list of some of the most popular UK cheeses is followed below. While certain cheeses are more popular with some regions, there's no reason why people shouldn't enjoy them all, either.

The cheese world is very diverse and diverse is the best cheese

It's not just about the price — there are thousands of ways to eat this good cheese, with each region of the world offering its own flavours, whether that takes the form of a cheese platter or whole cheese bowl.

Some of the most popular ways to enjoy cheeses in the UK include steaming, making pizza or spreading them on toast. If you're a cheese lover and fancy making its own recipe, why not try making your own cheese bread, cheese crackers, and other treats?

The UK's diverse range of cheese also includes things you might not expect such as Cajun cheese, cream cheese, and smoked cheddar cheese. For a taste of the country's cheeses, check out our gallery of UK cheeses.

Here's what you really need for your next party

Fresh cheese, as well as aged cheeses, can be cooked, mixed with food, or eaten raw. What you should never do with aged cheeses is microwave them. As a rule of thumb, if they've been sitting on a shelf for a few years, they are too hard, too sour (especially aged sour cream, which can't be microwaved like fresh cream) and too salty for a microwave dish. This article explains why!

The UK's cheeses have a wide range of uses and a long history, so whether you're looking for a great party dessert or a great addition to your meal or snack, you're sure to find it in the UK's cheese.

Some Japanese men feel a need to compete with westerners.

One recent Tokyo weekend, Hiroko Kaneda was working two jobs -- one at a gym and the other at a bar -- when one Saturday night during a busy period one of her boyfriends stopped her and confessed that while he was on the job, he picked up a foreigner female waitress who had just come in.

Kaneda admitted he may have tried to look the part and be polite. In fact though he did not ask for sex, he took the waitress to an off-limits floor and raped her.

She didn't report it, not wanting to be thought a sex trafficker.

Kaneda and her father, former journalist Kano, said that in Tokyo's modern business culture, it is not socially acceptable for men to talk about sex.

The idea that sex workers are victims of a crime is not widespread, as the media's recent coverage of an 18-year-old student who was raped in a Tokyo park by a Japanese taxi driver has revealed.

Though the incident sparked public outrage, and even some official efforts to combat human trafficking, some commentators say human trafficking is a non-issue, arguing that most sex workers are aware of the dangers such acts are capable of bringing about.

The concept is simple but ingenious: to fold some sheet of paper into a tube/box, cut it in half, use a sharp knife to make a notch, and then fold and staple each half so that they form an unbreakable frame/canister. In practice, the folded cardboard box gives a beautiful, solid effect to the paper, yet with great simplicity.

The box's interior should be plain white or neutral gray. The outside should be an interesting texture, such as green or orange.


One way to make the cardboard box is to use some heavy card stock and then fold the paper in half again for each corner. (You'll also need to make a notch with your knife.) Fold the paper in half again but this time you'll use a straight edge to trace around the edge of the cardboard and fold it. Make a straight cut in each corner.


After that, simply staple the paper into the front of the box, using glue and a staple gun. Make sure that you don't tear up the cardboard too much. You can also cut away some of the excess cardboard in the corner if you prefer.<|endoftext|>Kathleen Sebelius (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)

The Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday that it would provide $3.5 million in emergency funds to deal with the recent health crisis in Texas.

"The Obama Administration has provided $2.5 million in emergency food, energy, housing and health care support to Texas families and individuals in distress because of flooding, storms and other emergencies," Sylvia Mathews Burwell, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement. "Those resources are on top of the critical funding the President and Congress have already extended to communities for public safety, first responders and disaster recovery operations and are a small part of his $80 billion recovery package for Texans."

The money could go toward providing transportation to evacuees in the Houston area or help families find alternative housing. The Texas Department of Public Safety has also announced that all active military and police officers will be eligible to apply their pay to their health insurance to help pay for medical expenses, according to a statement.

"As the governor's office is taking care of the families in the city, the state is stepping in with resources as needed," Burwell said. "I encourage Texans impacted by severe weather to check with Emergency Response (936-395-4242) for assistance."<|endoftext|>This is the "Best of" series.

In addition, Shields, 31, has reportedly told his agents that he was open to a deal that could send him to the Yankees after the season, a source told ESPN.com. The Kansas City Royals agreed to sell Shields to the Detroit Tigers earlier this week for more than five years and more than $114 million, but Tigers President Dave Dombrowski did not specify if that provision was in the deal.

Although Shields has been an established starter for more than a decade, the deal with the Royals did not include any club option for the final two years of the deal that was reportedly for five years, $125 million. The Royals also can only buy out eight seasons at that price, which would mean Shields will not hit free agency, as ESPN's Jerry Crasnick first reported.

Shields, of course, is considered one of the best pitchers in baseball, but he has been in the midst of a career decline over the past two seasons as the result of injuries. With an annual salary of $14.5 million that includes a 2016 vesting option for $13 million that includes a $5 million buyout, Shields will be a free agent after the 2015 season. It is not known if Shields is seeking a four-year deal with an extra year for the extra money or if he's open to a deal that keeps him under the $14.5 million club option.

According to ESPN.com's Buster Olney, Shields' reps and the Blue Jays, who have been trying to trade him in hopes of

As part of Microsoft's Nokia-exclusive deal, it will be sold alongside a Lumia 920, and can also take advantage of Nokia Wallet and Windows Phone 8.1.

The phone itself has been designed and built by Finnish firm Ovi, which also builds the Nokia X. In fact, it's the company's first smartphone with a metal frame; the Nokia X is plastic.

The camera layout is just as we've come to expect: a 2.2-megapixel camera up front and a 4-megapixel one at the back. For those of you not familiar with the design, check it out below, in which the Lumia 920 is a shade lighter in color. The top photo is a better picture, showing just how much the Lumia 920 is curved.

At 5.2 inches, the phone is longer than the previous Polaris, which is 4.5-inches (including the protruding edge from the screen). It also adds a small but noticeable 2.8-inch touchscreen, and a new addition -- it doesn't support LTE.

The phone is made using the company's OmniPower technology, which has been touted by the company as a way around the need to include a battery and other hardware components, allowing the device to consume less power. This is especially important when you consider how much power the device will consume when you use it for extended periods of time.

Nokia's Windows Phone 8.0 will come preloaded for this phone, and the app store will only include some of the best Nokia apps available.

Polaris also packs NFC support, for transactions that need to be completed in stores, like the recent Starbucks deal. It includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for the Bluetooth version,

About Dethklok: Dethklok is a fictional band consisting of members of K.A.R.D.D. from "Dancing on the Edge" and members of the defunct band Klokateer from the television series "Metalocalypse". This band is known for featuring members of other bands such as Cursive, At the Drive In, and more. This band was formed by a group of college friends who were originally going to call themselves the Klokateers. When it was discovered that the members of the band were a mix of real people and fictional characters and the name didn't quite capture the true message of the band, the group eventually decided to abandon the project. However, it wasn't until 2008 when the band was resurrected. Today Dethklok is best known for their many live performances with their legendary live show. They have broken into numerous popular music festivals and arenas across the country and even played a part in getting the band into the Metalocalypse movie in 2011.

Doors: 5:00pm / Show: 6:00pm. No Exemption. All Ages and Ticket Type Catered. The following acts are confirmed thus far: • The Dethklok Cover Band • RokyE from At the Drive In with support from T.W.P (Vocals) • The Kreators • Skillet • The Headbangers

This is because of a common law rule known as the Exclusionary Rule.

What Is the Exclusionary Rule?

The exclusionary rule is a common law rule that says a police officer cannot be held liable for any of their own statements used against someone in a civil court. In civil court, the exclusionary rule has an important exception.

There would be no waiting periods that limited access to high school and college. There would be no barriers to high school graduation. And there would be no more "college is for everyone" excuses. We'd be doing away with a "college education is for everyone" narrative that had made college the new middle-class status quo. We wouldn't keep offering scholarships that only go to privileged kids. We would be giving low-income kids who work hard a way into college.

These ideals have been in place for decades, but in the past year Republicans in Congress have been making good on the promise of "school choice." The goal of House Republicans and Senate conservatives — and the way they have been sold to the public, too — is to create a new system of school funding that gives tax dollars to schools that serve the most disadvantaged kids.

The federal government already funds nearly $30 billion annually to education in the form of student aid that is distributed through an array of programs and grants. Republicans want to make that spending even more generous in the next fiscal year. Right now, about 40 percent of Americans have federal student loan debt. That would probably be higher if not for this tax plan, which would allow student loan interest to be deducted from income and be tax deductible for graduate students at tax time. And Republicans say this plan will free up more than $1.2 trillion dollars over 10 years, enough to reduce the national debt by $2 trillion.

[Why it's so easy for Republicans to talk about education — but keep forgetting it matters]

But while these ideas are great, you can't help but notice that almost all

[Updated version here: http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1201197-bug/]


So long story short, an admin of a forum that I work for, asked me if I would like to see some mods added to the ESO UI, because he saw these mods and said they would make the UI look better than Oblivion or Morrowind. So I thought "Hell right, why not!" and I went crazy adding some of my own.


Some people might not like it as it's not the original UI and it has the Elder Scrolls logo instead of E.


I also had to delete the MGSO code from the original version because I ran into problems with the .NET API. I was using my own code to make it work, so I didn't want to lose the experience.


But now, we have this, a very tweaked version of my first UI for Morrowind.


I've added:

-An improved style of font used for the scrollbar

-A background texture

-Updated controls for the new features of the UI


A few things to note:

-If you don't see scrollbars, or the menu bar, simply go to the console and type "cs" and then you'll be able to see it.

-If you find any bugs, please let me know.

A number of students at the University of the South of Wales (USW) in Carmarthen woke up to hear the bride and groom's name being read out loud at their wedding reception, which was held inside Aberystwyth Town Hall.


According to the Daily Post they were all stunned by the groom's surname being called aloud on the evening but quickly realised the reason it was happening was due to a clerical error, which is common across the UK and beyond.

One student told reporters: "Everyone around us was saying his name but we couldn't hear him because the ceremony was in Welsh! He was so happy and so happy to be married.


"As they were reading his name out, the whole hall started laughing because his name was really strange. We were shocked but at the same time we were excited so we didn't really know what to do."


While the young woman gave an excellent speech at the end of the night, the groom was reportedly not able to control his "rage", after she had refused to kiss him during their "official" ceremony.


"He yelled something about how he wanted to take a shower after they got married," a student told the Daily Post.


As the "incident" continued, it sparked a massive social media backlash with many people criticising their bridal gowns being "too small" and asking more about her hair.


Others praised the young woman for her "bubbly" personality.


The USW College of Arts and Humanities has responded to the incident and said they will be making sure her name is never spoken out loud again.


The school added: "When the ceremony took place, both the bride and groom were given an in-class ceremony, where they were able to hear the other read out the first names of the guests.


"It was important to the organisers that, despite speaking in Welsh, both of the brides were happy with the ceremony and felt that the ceremony went well."<|endoftext|>"There is this belief that there's a natural thing, you get to a certain age, where you lose that magic," she told the BBC's Mark Eastcott, "that you're just an animal and it's just you and your family anymore."

Virtual reality has become commonplace, but for some people it can be a rather terrifying notion, both the technology of it all and the fact they'll be entering a completely new world. But while the technology and experiences have both been around longer than VR headset development, the ability for people to share their virtual adventures with other people online has only recently come of age.

Now the first real-world VR social network – Virtual Desktop – is set to go live on Windows 10 and it could be game-changing.

Using Microsoft's Edge browser and Xbox One, users on all platforms will be able to create virtual spaces that other players can explore from across the world.

Virtual Desktop will be launched with over 100 unique spaces, including iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament with more than 40,000 available to explore. It will be open world, so users can walk around and explore from whatever corner they choose, regardless of whether their devices are connected to the online network.

While the concept may seem a little obvious for virtual reality, the service is set to fundamentally change the way we interact with digital spaces. Users will be able to interact with each other using voice and gaze-based controls, as well as sharing each other's experiences through shared experiences. In fact, a virtual reality social network is the first real-world social network in what may be the most transformative social space in human history.

But Virtual Desktop will provide a social platform in itself, offering other players the opportunity to communicate and play. For example, a player could visit a virtual room where they could meet with others and make friends – a virtual version of real-life social club rooms and social networks. Virtual desktop will be a real-time game, with players playing from their homes so there will be no annoying lag delays.

Microsoft has partnered with several developers currently working on virtual reality experiences to ensure they are fully supported as part of the platform. These include Insomniac Games (RIGS; Edge, Batman: Arkham VR), Harmonix, and Owlchemy Labs (RIGS, Rez Infinite).

In a press statement issued ahead of the launch it is clear that Microsoft fully expects the virtual reality platform to change the way people interact with their computing. "I want our developers to have an amazing variety of content, and in my view the best way to do that is to make sure every device you use will support virtual reality. And from day one of the platform release we'll focus on making life easier for developers by making sure every device is the ideal place to create virtual reality experiences," said Terry Myerson, CEO of Windows.

In addition to the social experience, Microsoft has released the Edge browser for Windows 10 and Xbox One so you can also interact with Virtual Desktop in this way using a phone or your PC. Edge is an incredibly powerful tool as it allows you to go beyond webpages to do all kinds of things. Users can take advantage of a range of Cortana voice commands (which are only available in Edge and Xbox One) and use their device's camera to take pictures or record video.

The experience in Virtual Desktop is not without flaws, and it can be a little clumsy at times, especially given the lack of third-party apps supporting the feature.

Virtual Desktop was initially slated to launch when

"I'm a personal trainer. I train every day, seven days a week, for the past seven years. Nobody thinks maybe I just trained hard. No one thinks 'maybe he paced himself through the first half and when the second half came he just let himself go'."

He added: "All along the route are stewards and people watching. There's no way you can cheat."

Other runners have questioned why Miss Raworth, 45, was held up. She complained about the incident on Twitter, where Elliot Fineberg, a civil servant, said he had encountered a similar problem, delaying him by seven minutes.

Mr Fineberg said he was "gutted" at the hold-up, having trained for six months for his first marathon. He was challenged by two officials, he said, and was initially told by one that "she knew I was lying 'by the look in your eye' ".

"[I] tried to run by at first but she said they would get the police," he wrote. The group "refused to leave" until they had "called someone to check my name and number".

Another of Miss Raworth's Twitter followers described the offending official as a "jobsworth" and

 pointed out that other runners had also been caught out, the Daily Mail claimed.

The Metropolitan Police said that the investigation was "ongoing" but that their inquiries were ongoing on how this particular run was made possible.

A Met spokesman said: "The Met understands there has been some controversy in the run and its cause. We were called out to Whitechapel Road to a runner who appeared to be experiencing a problem with her electronic bib.

"We are following this matter in an ongoing enquiry and will be making no further comment until there is a conclusion of enquiry."<|endoftext|>The White House announced today that Hillary Clinton is coming to California for a series of events ahead of the June 7th primary.

Clinton will visit Los Angeles and San Diego, both of which will vote early on June 7th. She will then hold a rally in Sacramento, joining other Hillary Clinton events in the state.

California Gov. Jerry Brown will also officially endorse Clinton. He will be joined Thursday evening by members of the California Democratic Party for a celebration of the Democratic Party.

"In California, Hillary Clinton has built a big, passionate, loyal and diverse base of supporters on the Democratic Party's diverse map of communities and regions," Brown said in his endorsement. "She's already won some of the most important contests of the primary season, and now she is turning her attention to California to earn a majority of pledged delegates in a primary election next month and ensure that Clinton is the next nominee.

"Hillary has also led for the better part of a year on all key issues like raising incomes, ending fracking, bringing jobs back to America and getting big money out of politics," he continued. "The Democratic Party is in good hands with Hillary Clinton as our nominee for President."

The Clinton Campaign's California organizer was identified only as "Aide to the President."

The event today was slated for 5 p.m. in Los Angeles. Clinton's event will be held at the Hollywood Palladium, 1 Hollywood Blvd. in Los Angeles.<|endoftext|>The latest report from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers suggests that the average cell phone battery could last up to 12 years before needing to be replaced. The news, which is already sparking debate on the issue, comes only years after LG had proclaimed that the battery on the Galaxy S4 would last for between three and five years and that users would likely need to replace their phones every three to five years – which was far above current industry standards.

The IEEE's new standards are based on a different measurement standard than other manufacturers use (a metric called "power density"). The study, which tested a list of 13 models of smartphone and tablet from the leading manufacturers – including Apple, Samsung and LG – and examined their lifetime battery life. The results indicate that users could expect to keep these devices for an average of six years – with longer lifespan depending on the device.

In comparison, the battery on the latest Samsung Galaxy S3 lasted on average just 5.5 years before the device needed to be replaced. LG's original Galaxy S is still running strong a year after the phone was released. The new S4, on the other hand, seems to have fared more poorly. Though the handset should only last a staggering six years, an S5 model is expected to last 8 years.

"It makes me feel more comfortable being able to leave my phone in my pocket and being able to do my day to day activities without worry about it lasting that long"

It seems that a lot of consumers' fears over battery life are unfounded. However some of these fears are a consequence of the increased popularity of phones with larger displays (most models are larger than 4 inches). As a result, the battery

: Leaving the competition coughing in your dust bubbles.

Here's an example from webprofits.com:

It conveys a solid benefit to the reader, and promises information on how they can overthrow their competition on Google.

Looking for more ways to come up with attention grabbing headlines? Here's 9 more proven formulas.

The AIDA Formula

You have a white knuckle grasp on who your prospect is. You know his pains and desires. And you have a headline that'll drag him in like demonic tornado.

Now it's time to lay down some copy.

Productivity usually plummets at this stage. People find themselves drowning in writer's block… wondering "what now?"

Well fear not, the famous AIDA formula (popularized by the legendary Gary Halbert) will pluck you from the crushing coils of writer's block. Just like a superhero swinging down to pluck you from a speeding car.

The AIDA formula acts as a skeleton for most sales letters. It is structured around the wavering interest levels of your reader. Which helps you anticipate his thoughts, questions and objections
==================== COMPLETION 401 ====================
.

So use this formula to find the topics in your email and write the perfect headline.

The best advice I have is, don't read your own headlines! Read the headline of all other letters. If a headline does not resonate with your prospects, stop reading it. And get back to writing.

Here's a copy template (based off the AIDA template) to help you with your headlines.

"I understand your pain. I was struggling to reach my prospects this month because all of my best ideas just wouldn't make the cut.

So what I learned is that the people I'm interested in aren't always looking for the same things. Maybe they don't want a book, for example, or a book recommendation. Maybe they just want to read the latest book I've written.

Either way, your business is about connecting people with what they want.

In order to do that you need to understand their pain. This pain can be in:

A.) their current situation, B.) their budget

Either way, understanding the pain of your prospects is where most content marketing fails. To be great at content marketing you need to know what your audience is looking for."

Your prospect has already been given enough information about your business, so now it's time to fill him in with as much more information. Keep writing!

"Here's where we meet:

Your prospects want to connect with a blogger. I know, because I once was a blogger myself!

So I thought I'd take a break. When I resumed my content marketing endeavors I immediately realized it would be much easier if I wrote to people who were familiar with what I was doing.

My friend's mom gave me this great quote:

"I have a great product for my market. However, I can't sell my product to people you're not familiar with."

And my answer:

"I do this for a living. The people I need are your relatives and your friends."

I now have a list of all the people within my marketing target demographic, and you'll have no trouble connecting with any of them.

And my headline goes like this:

"I Understand Your Pain – I Was Trying To Connect with Your Target Audience. Can I Connect With Them?"

And here's my first sample.

3 Step Process

The first copy for the subject line should come after the body copy. This is a common rule of thumb that is simple and effective.

For example, here you can see the copy for the first sentence:

"I understand your pain"

If you need inspiration on how to write first sentence copy in emails, read this.

Here is another example. It is the first sentence of a sales letter.

"I'm sorry I haven't been writing at the speed I should. I need some time to myself to think about how this is going to be the first step in your career improvement."

Your subject line should not only be informative, but also entertaining.

In fact, your subject line can be a way to turn your sales letter into a great email. It tells the reader who you are, what you do and why he/she is in your target market. It's a powerful way to get inside your prospect's mind.

Your first sentence copy should be an eye opener. It asks:

"What's in it for me?"

What have you done?

What problem are you trying to tackle?

Tell them about yourself. If they can relate to that then they'll be more interested.

Then your subject line should tell

The AIDA Formula

You have a white knuckle grasp on who your prospect is. You know his pains and desires. And you have a headline that'll drag him in like demonic tornado.

Now it's time to lay down some copy.

Productivity usually plummets at this stage. People find themselves drowning in writer's block… wondering "what now?"

Well fear not, the famous AIDA formula (popularized by the legendary Gary Halbert) will pluck you from the crushing coils of writer's block. Just like a superhero swinging down to pluck you from a speeding car.

The AIDA formula acts as a skeleton for most sales letters. It is structured around the wavering interest levels of your reader. Which helps you anticipate his thoughts, questions and objections

The formula looks like this:

AIDA+

For a few dollar.

Your copy needs at least 4 steps in order to get you a decent sale. The rest is for show.

As previously mentioned, a strong headline can be almost as important as the lead sheet, if not more.

Remember the principle of building a reader habit? That's where you make your prospect feel like a part of your team, like they're one of your team members.

An attention grabbing headline has to strike the right chord with the reader. It has to grab them from the subconscious.

So how do you create a headline that makes your prospect feel part of your team, that they relate to you?

1. Make your prospect's eyes dance

It's the most primal and intimate feeling you can get: "What's that smell?"

It's the sense of being part of something, a community. It's where you feel "one with" another person. Your readers are just like you, are they not?

The best headlines make your prospect smile:

"You don't need to be afraid."

"I want to tell you why I'm going to be a happy customer. But first I want to talk to you about the benefits of the app I'm going to show you."

2. Make your listener feel loved

Your readers expect to be connected to what's happening inside your team. Every step inside of your page, every interaction, is your audience engaging and connecting to you.

If you can make that connection, you'll build an enormous amount of authority, and your prospects start to love you right back.

"Tell them you're going to give them $25 off…"

"…for your first purchase…"

"…for a year…for 30 days."

These are the kind of headlines that have created my biggest sales in years. They're personal and real to me, they say what I think, but the copy resonates. When you've got an audience that believes in your brand that much, you're going to sell.

3. Make your listener feel important

Your lead sheet is your chance to let your prospective client or client base know their importance in your book of business.

Your lead sheet should be filled with words of encouragement, gratitude, support and motivation. Make sure any headline you use focuses on your lead sheet.

A headline like this should have a special meaning because it's the first words you introduce to your prospect. It shows your client's importance in the journey.

And if you have a strong lead sheet, then there's nothing stopping you from throwing out your headline. This is a free marketing tactic I use so often:

"We just created 1 of the most important leads you will ever get."

4. Tell your prospects how

Don't just throw out ideas. Choose your words carefully so that your readers know what you're talking about.

One of my favourite headline phrases is "How to…" This phrase allows the reader to see the problem being solved, the result being achieved, the path to reach your end goal, and so on.

You wouldn't say: "How to get a new customer?" Instead you would say: "How to get more leads." It will give the reader a clear path to the final goal.

For example:

"…How to build a long term relationship on Google Ads".

Here we go:

A simple but brilliant premise. An elevator pitch. The best part: this formula won't just work with your prospects, it WILL WORK FOR YOU. The best thing about it is it's not a formula that gets handed to you or thrown to the lions. You already know how you would go about using it. Just remember – it's your decision. AIDA won't just work for you, it WORKS FOR YOU.


Here it is spelled out in a nutshell – this formula creates the elevator elevator pitch you should be telling a prospect every time you meet with someone who wants your product, service or business.

The following template will walk you through what AIDA is and how to effectively use it as a template.

Start AIDA

I started AIDA last year in an effort to change the way I sell. Because my sales were going down. And nobody was selling.

Then I had a meeting with a very talented guy who had just come to me from a company called Salesforce.com. I think they're the only company in the world that invented something called CPA (Customer Acquisition Pricing) – the idea you charge them an initial set fee and then charge them every time they spend money!

I asked him, what is your CPA? He looks me in the eye, and says: It's 5%. You have to give up all your rights, your control, your ability to sell, your ability to change the rules on them, your ability to do ANYTHING in an even and fair manner.

I said to myself: I don't give a f*ck! I'm going to fight this guy. This will take all day! And we'll do it live on the spot! I'm going to fight for 5%! I'm going to do this right.

I went home, wrote out a little letter, called every single one of my friends and business partners, started telling them my idea – and we won! I had never before done anything like this. Ever!

Because of that, I changed how I sold in that first year. Because of that, I changed the way I look at sales at my company.

I started telling prospects the same thing: "The only way I can make your business big and profitable is to charge them an amount equal to their entire purchase. All I can change is the price,"

Because of that, salespeople didn't just sell like they were in a classroom.

Instead of saying, "We can sell you for $0, or we can sell you for $4,000", they started saying things like, "If we can put you in a room with the best product, the best service and the best customer service, we can sell you for the right price." And that's what our product does!

How to Use AIDA in Sales Letters

I used this idea as the backbone for 10 years of making the elevator pitch I tell to prospects. Now there's more and more salespeople taking my elevator pitch to heart. They know that by having an elevator pitch that's backed by AIDA they can literally change the way they sell.

They know that simply telling a prospect what they want isn't enough. They also need to change the mindset that they have of what an attractive prospect looks like.

They also know a good elevator pitch doesn't need to be perfect. It's not what they need, their prospect thinks. They feel something, a pulse. That's how you tell them.

But a decent elevator pitch will tell them the real reason they should buy from your product: Because of your great product/service/business.

Here's an example from an email marketing case study:

"…What more do you want? Are you looking for details? We give you all the detail. Is your attention split with your lead generation clients? We want it 80/20."

It sounds like someone trying to sell his product and he's trying to answer two completely different questions at the same time. Sounds hard.

But it's not. This is what Salesforce.com does when they want to sell to an email prospect.

Here's another example from Google My Business:

"You can get a free quote with a maximum of 2 emails per month for $14,00 per month… If you are considering making the move to WordPress, you have just found your opportunity! If you have an account with Google My Business, or any other CRM, you can get a free quote no matter your experience level."

It's a little bit more complicated than an email template or even a product page, but the concept of the AIDA formula is exactly the same.

Just in a more polished, more detailed way.

If you want a simple template, here's a simple template from Shopify.

Just don't rely on AIDA for the whole case study. In many cases they don't need it.

Instead, use your own judgement, and tailor the headline to each prospect in a conversational/emotional, human style.

This isn't a formula… it's how I do it.

That's the last word on crafting an email marketing headline in 2016.

"This historic vote to protect human embryos from cloning and infanticide is a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation," said Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), who wrote the bill and is a member of the Senate's Intelligence Committee.

According to a press release by her office, Mikulski, along with Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca), Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and other female senators, worked hard to "protect human life from the moment of conception and in vitro fertilization to preserve the right of innocent human life, with the right to life beginning at conception."

"The purpose of this legislation, which is the culmination of nearly a decade's worth of work of this group, is to protect the right of innocent human life," she said.

"The use of stem cells will be banned," Mikulski stated. "The use of blastocysts [or 'eggs'] will be banned. Human embryo research will be limited to research to create embryos with a specific genetic makeup."

According to the press release, the $585 billion Senate defense authorization bill passed by unanimous voice vote.

In 2010, the Obama administration vetoed an identical bill, but the Senate successfully approved the veto-proof bill two years later by a 98-0 vote, with Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) voting present.

The ban on using human embryos in IVF was also unanimously endorsed earlier this year by a Senate committee that considered HR 676, a bill introduced Tuesday by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that proposed the same ban.

Starting July 1, schools that participate in the federal Direct Loan program must remove these clauses from their contracts.

Regulatory advocates called the rule a game-changer.

"For far too long, predatory schools have used fraud as a business model, and they've gotten away with it by shutting the courthouse doors to students and forcing those students into individual, secret arbitrations," Lisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch division, said in a statement.

"The burden of making students whole for fraud should fall on the shoulders of schools that break the law, not vulnerable students or the public."

The rule, which aims to protect students from predatory practices, also offers relief for students who have been defrauded or deceived by a school, like those who attended Corinthian College and ITT Technical Institute.

It creates a process in which federal loans will be automatically discharged, so long as the student did not enroll in another institution that participates in federal financial aid programs within three years. But the school must have closed on or after Nov. 1, 2013.

The rules also require financially risky schools to provide clear, plain-language warnings to prospective students, current students and the public
==================== COMPLETION 405 ====================
, and they set aside $5 million to reimburse students who get denied or suspended from a school, even if they completed their educational goals or were working toward a degree.

The rule was finalized two years ago, but its implementation was delayed in the wake of the Corinthian mess.

Colleges affected by the rule include Kaplan and Career Education Corporation, which operated ITT Technical Institute, and Corinthian Colleges, which closed.

The rule also has major implications for private schools, like Kaplan, which have no connection to federal financial aid programs.

Under the rules, any private nonprofit college that closes or is facing regulatory action, whether by the government or by a judge, could be barred from the program and be liable for $30,000 of the principal outstanding on any federal Stafford or Perkins loans.

"If any entity is barred for these reasons from participating in the federal program, they will not be able to extend repayment to anyone," the White House said.

President Obama on Tuesday called on Congress to swiftly reauthorize a higher education legislation that passed a year ago last June, the Higher Education Act, and then-President Obama signed into law in December.

"In a few short months, the Obama administration has successfully reformed the way colleges and universities do business in this country," he continued, announcing that he was signing the legislation into law two months early.

The Higher Education Act sets federal student loan terms, requires colleges receiving federal loans to provide students with fair and equal access to educational programs, and requires states to continue the high level of funding in their higher education systems.

The White House said that the reform could prevent another crisis like the one at Corinthian College and other for-profit schools, whose student loan debt doubled to $1.2 billion from 2008 to 2015.

"Today, every American, regardless of family income, is more likely to be able to afford college tuition than ever before," Obama said.

But opponents to the reform are fighting back, and a lawsuit is going to court.

Lawyers for Education Sector (ESD), which operates a federal loan servicing company, claim that the rule overreach its authority.

"It is unlawful and an unreasonable requirement to require that institutions that accept federal funds to provide these very services for federal student loans," William Evers, principal deputy general counsel at ESD said in a statement on Tuesday.

"ESD cannot ensure compliance when we have no visibility into the institutions' financial condition, are not subject to oversight, and cannot be counted on to conduct due diligence on behalf of the government. The only meaningful oversight that ESD has to oversee student lenders comes from the lenders. The Federal Reserve has made the point repeatedly that the private sector has the expertise, resources, and capacity to provide financial services to federal student lenders."

The group has also filed a lawsuit that challenges a provision of the higher education law that allows the Education Department to determine that a school is "bad" and subject it to stricter regulations.

The Education Department says that it has discretion in this case, but also acknowledges that schools with poor academic or financial performance could be punished.

The DOE will still decide whether to impose these tougher sanctions and how to do so, but the agency said that it could withhold federal funds. If the school fails a third time, it is shut down and forced to close its doors.<|endoftext|>For Immediate Release

Starting July 1, schools that participate in the federal Direct Loan program must remove these clauses from their contracts.

Regulatory advocates called the rule a game-changer.

"For far too long, predatory schools have used fraud as a business model, and they've gotten away with it by shutting the courthouse doors to students and forcing those students into individual, secret arbitrations," Lisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch division, said in a statement.

 on campus, including in catalogs, videos, websites and advertisements. They also will be required to maintain detailed records of all students — who their parents were, any loans, any loans received — when a student leaves, to be provided for review.

The rules are a response to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's June 2014 decision to withdraw a previous rule meant to address student rights over federal loans, the Education Department's "prompt closure" rule, which was set to take effect in August 2014.

The rule would have required colleges to provide borrowers accurate and complete information about the available options for repaying federal loans. The final rule provides borrowers with more information and is expected to help students understand the options available to them once they have obtained loans.

The Obama administration said the withdrawal of the rule was necessary to give student borrowers and the public time to prepare for the changes. A public comment period on the rule will be open until Sept. 20, according to a fact sheet from the Education Department.

The Department of Education's rule doesn't include any new funding for schools under its Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, a law designed to make sure all borrowers have the opportunity to be repaid on time. The law also allows debt collectors to not be sued for collecting on a student's federal student loans, while the CFPB's final rules make it easier for debt collectors to collect on borrowers' student debt.

The new law doesn't require colleges that participate in the Direct Loan program to give borrowers a choice. Instead, it requires schools to make it a condition of participating.<|endoftext|>I can't stop thinking about this scene in the first episode of the new season of "Veep" about a week and a half ago, when the first lady is describing how she has found her voice. Her voice is still so quiet. The first daughter can't even say her mom's name without the words falling out of her mouth. She can't scream out, "I've got a disease!"

The first daughter has cancer; the second has the same disease. The first daughter is a good mother, the second not so much. The first is a great mother, the second not so much. Why wouldn't you be disgusted? "Veep" is a sharp satire of presidential politics, and a lot of the ways America can express disapproval of the president. But this kind of thing is happening often -- in office as well as among the populace -- as my doctor and others in my life point out.

We have all been exposed to different versions of this. When we say our child has autism or attention deficit disorder, we will be told that we've chosen a bad diagnosis, and they will be given medication. If we say we have an eating disorder, we expect the person who treated us is going to be so ashamed (and we are often) that she might not talk to us anymore, despite having been a good friend. If we say our child has depression or ADHD, we don't have any sense that this is something to take seriously, or that we want it to be treated seriously.

When a celebrity dies, a lot of news outlets and television personalities will go out of their way to mourn the loss. As much as I will grieve for his loss, I will mourn the loss of any celebrity who could have been considered a role model. I can't say the same thing about our children.<|endoftext|>The latest on the manhunt for suspect wanted in the killings of two women and a 7-year-old; a man in custody and being questioned in the slayings

Those schools would have the option of voluntarily closing, and schools that don't could be subject to a fine, a suspension or an outright ban from participating in the federal lending program for six months.

The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators said the rule represents "historic opportunity" to give borrowers the help they deserve.

"This rule puts students in the driver's seat of their own repayment decisions, empowering them to understand their repayment options and determining whether they remain responsible for their loans after they exit the school," said Chris Murray, its president.

The Direct Loan program has become controversial since the 2012 settlement agreement for the Justice Department's lawsuit against the defunct for-profit Education Management Corporation.

A report by the Government Accountability Office released earlier this year found that over 7,000 Corinthian students had closed on their loans but were then left vulnerable to debt collector tactics and predatory practices by the company.

"This is what people have known in the industry for a while: Students who leave one school and take out a Direct Loan just to get a job could be taken advantage of," said Adam Levitin, a law and public finance professor at Georgetown University.

Rapoport reported Wednesday night that the Browns and Bengals had agreed to terms. According to Rapoport, Guenther would get a raise -- to a maximum of $900,000 -- and be given full access to the Bengals' draft board at the front offices of both teams.

The former Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator led the Bengals in pass attempts allowed (523) this season. Since 2011, the Bengals allowed the fewest points in the NFL. Cincinnati allowed a league-low 4.3 yards per rush this season.

The Bengals signed defensive line coach James Willis over the weekend after firing Jim O'Neil, who had compiled a 28-12 record since joining Cincinnati as its defensive backs coach in 2012. However, Rapoport said Tuesday there's still no timetable for the end of offensive coordinator Ken Zampese's tenure with the team.

The Bengals return from their bye in Week 13 with a five-week stretch against the Tennessee Titans, New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs sandwiched between games against the Oakland Raiders (October 21) and Buffalo Bills (October 28).

As for his role, Guenther told NFL Media's Aditi Kinkhabwala on Tuesday that he will be heavily involved in the coaching staff's preparation for the Bills and, "If needed, I'll be working in games and helping with game planning and things like that to help out with it." Guenther also will continue to be involved with the defensive backs.

On average, Cincinnati's defensive backs allowed a passer rating of 84.1 in games last season (31st in the NFL). That was the lowest in the NFL. Opposing passers averaged 17.2 yards per attempt (8th in the NFL). The Bengals' defensive backs also contributed five interceptions, five forced fumbles and five sacks this season.

Rapoport previously reported the Browns had agreed to terms with defensive line coach Larry Aikens. Aikens played defensive end for Cincinnati and Dallas (1995-2002) and started 48 games and registered six sacks (1.5 sacks per game).

Rapoport also reported the Browns and Chiefs had agreed to terms with free-agent wide receiver Brandon

 for their students at least two months when schools are opening for the first time or are seeking to extend a school's eligibility to a new program.

The Obama administration originally issued rules on how schools would have to comply with the rules, and the White House will now be updating them with a formal law. That's expected to happen by June.

Lawmakers will also likely have a chance to weigh in. A group of 20 House Democrats recently sent a letter to Education Secretary Arne Duncan (D) demanding that the administration withdraw the rule.

"The rule is based on a deeply flawed and arbitrary decision that has already been overturned in court and will be overturned again by a court that we expect to reverse this rule in due course," the letter said.

Lawmakers have also criticized the administration's recent decision to require school employees who fraudulently misrepresented their work experiences on applications and applications in general to do community service instead. Duncan, in his letter, suggested that the administration may be leaning too heavily on this program. However, Education Department officials believe that the rule alone will not do enough to protect students from misrepresentations.

The administration is also under fire for how it handles debt relief to students of Corinthian and ITT Tech, two schools found to have misleading applications and fraudulent contracts with the government.

Duncan told the Financial Times he has "no doubt" that these companies will face sanctions from his department.

"That's because the rules were weak relative to the companies who used them, and I want to make sure that they do not use any of the same loopholes as they have been using," Duncan said.<|endoftext|>I'd say my friend and I spent about an hour-ish each way, which meant about a $90 total. When I say $90, I don't mean we spent literally ninety dollars on tickets and food at the same time. We basically made it back as much for our travel expense expenses. I was actually surprised to learn this information because we both thought our expenses were pretty similar.

I went on a month long trip to Los Angeles with my friend Nick, so we basically split the expense into two different parts. Since the cost of a month at Disney was around $3,000 for us to split a month and our Disney tickets were $750 a seat, that means our actual expenses were around $2,500 each.

So what was our total? $2,600: $900 travel, $1,150 food. Not bad at all and still saved a fair amount of money, even in comparison to something more expensive, like an overnight, or getting into Universal Studios, which I was really happy about because we could save a couple hundred dollars with that one, too.

I should probably also mention we were both extremely late to the idea that "going to Disney is expensive" and we'd been saving money since we were in high school, so I don't think our budget ever really seemed to get out of whack. I would say I was saving $800-900 per month from our total expenses – in comparison to my friend Nick who was saving $1,400-1,500.

What's the best part about going to Disney? No matter what you might think, it's totally worth it. The food, the Disney magic, the fun, the memories – these things are amazing.

Let's be real for a moment: there's a lot of people out there that go to Disney because they're afraid they won't be able to afford it.

 ...

It is the IPA's job to fight, not fund, the tobacco industry — Australia, The Independent, 30th April, 2010

... they'll happily agree with the above statement.

The IPA may be a relatively small group but they have huge impact. And when they see their agenda is supported by people who will not question the policy they see it as their duty to defend it.

As for Tony Abbott's speech to The Petroleum Club...

His comments were not the first indication of how he plans to attack Clive Palmer's renewable energy target.

In this newspaper last month he had the following to say:

The Prime Minister is now talking of a national energy system which he is certain would drive up electricity prices. It would. — The Australian, 15th April, 2010

Here's what he actually said:

As far as we are concerned the system that we've had in place now, with all its problems, is still working reasonably well. But to our mind the problem is simply that if you take any number of systems with a wide range of options to choose from that the end product that you are trying to achieve is pretty much the same. — The Australian, 30th April, 2010

And he goes on to say...

We are not going to be asking people to pay more because there are some additional costs. It's going to depend in the end on when the price of the final product has been reduced and how much of a reduction we've actually achieved from carbon pricing schemes. — The Australian, 30th April, 2010

So what is a lot more likely to happen is that we continue to be in the same situation we are now, with all the distortions, all the other costs and all the different incentives that go with it. — The Australian, 30th April, 2010

Then there is this:

Mr Abbott was also asked on 6pm on ABC Radio National about his criticism of Labor's carbon tax. He refused to join in the Coalition attack on the plan. — The Australian, 15th April, 2010

As it happened a couple of days ago, the Coalition leader had a similar view:

... Mr Abbott's comments are no surprise, as his government has made fighting climate change a high priority. —The Australian, 15th April, 2010

And today his energy spokesman Joe Hockey issued the following statement...

The Prime Minister's comments yesterday at a National Press Club breakfast were clearly an attempt to divide Labor and the Greens in an effort to promote his energy policies and attack the Federal Government's renewable energy target. —Joe Hockey, 3rd May, 2010

Now if the IPA had had their way we'd have a carbon tax. That's what they wanted anyway (and would have supported them against us all in the parliament).

And the IPA has, despite its claims that it's against the tobacco industry, given a generous bit of funding to it.

But just because the IPA is a small organization doesn't mean they don't wield a lot of power or influence.

So the question is...

When the IPA is so powerful, can it be trusted? Are they making the best decisions for their members? And can the public trust the organisation for any decisions it makes? — Tony Abbott and Scott Emerson, 29th April, 2010

Tony Abbott and Scott Emerson have been making speeches to The Australian, and today they were the guest speakers at the IPA's national conference in Newcastle...

It's not your run-of-the-mill government conference, and the two leaders did not disappoint.

As we have seen, during the federal election there were many issues where the Abbott Government could have improved.

 how they're working with the Liberal Party, they've got a pretty good story for you...

In fact, it was the Liberal government that first introduced plain packaging to Australia.

In 1993 it passed legislation making tobacco pack warnings compulsory; six years earlier, the National Party government had tried but failed to mandate a system.

The new Liberal government, led by John Howard, gave tobacco companies six years to comply. And they were. - Tim Wilson, Australia's most senior anti-smoking officer, writes to Philip Morris' global head, Gary Harwood, 13th June, 2012

The evidence was strong — and that it didn't work, a view shared by the tobacco industry.

As Gary Harwood, the head of international operations for Philip Morris, wrote in 1992:

A significant number of our customers do not now regard plain packaging as the most effective, cost effective measure for increasing the uptake of plain packaging. — Philip Morris International Ltd, 1992

The Australian government, however, was happy to see the campaign succeed. Their response was more measured.

After the campaign started, the Australian Government launched its first public consultation on the issue, the "Tobacco Plain Packaging Inquiry".

As part of that inquiry, the Government commissioned the consultancy work of Philip Morris Australia... - The Canberra Times, 10th April, 2012

A few months later, the Productivity Commission produced their report on the plain packaging campaign, called "The Truth about Telling: An Assessment of Packaging as a Strategy for Reducing Tobacco Use".

The Commission had no formal role in policy-making, but their report recommended that plain packaging should not proceed.

Their argument was that plain packaging would just create a "confusion" in the consumer market — and the tobacco industry would come out of it stronger.

And on 16th February 1995, the Productivity Commission report was released — and the Commission endorsed plain packaging:

A single, well-designed package on the packet is a much better means for preventing young minds from misusing nicotine and tobacco than would be the complex design of the myriad of individual packages already on the field. — Commission on cigarette packaging, 1997

But the tobacco industry wasn't ready to give up on plain packaging.

A few weeks later, Philip Morris released a statement...

The tobacco industry has responded to the introduction of the plain packaging laws in Australia with a significant statement. It was sent out by Philip Morris Asia Pacific PTE, an offshoot company, after a news report on Monday night that plain packaging legislation was imminent. — Philip Morris, Phillip Morris Asia Pacific PTE press release, 16th February 1995

And they repeated it in the months to come.

And as they said in the press release...

The Australian government...has made its own decision as well, based on an incorrect interpretation of the facts. By insisting on having its own way, it is sending a clear message that it can do whatever it wants with the public health policies it wants to impose. - Philip Morris, Philip Morris Asia Pacific PTE press release, 23rd April 1995

So Philip Morris tried to convince the Australian government to back down...

Philip Morris made several representations regarding the health consequences of Australian introducing a cigarette plain packaging scheme, including the following points of emphasis...

There can be no doubt that a significant increase in the consumption of tobacco products could be expected. It is an indisputable fact that a large amount of plain packaging would result in more people engaging in tobacco use. We would be concerned about any such increase being achieved by creating additional access for minors. - Philip Morris Asia Pacific PTE, Philip Morris Asia Pacific PTE press release, 14th

==================== COMPLETION 411 ====================
 about its funding, it claims the tobacco industry is not one of its biggest donors.

When Andrew Bolt last week wrote that the government was seeking to ban the IPA from funding it because of its "outright lies" about smoking and health, the IPA replied that...

The Australian: Your question raises a number of issues which should form part of the government's review of state lobbying groups. The ABC has asked for comment from the Attorney-General's Department on those questions. Andrew Bolt: That question was answered a few minutes ago. — The Australian, 30th April, 2010

So far, the government has not responded to the questions it has been asked.

What is in the IPA's books, though, is also something the federal government and the tobacco companies have not been willing to reveal...

The IPA has been given money by the tobacco industry — The IPA, 6th October, 2010

The Tobacco Institute also donated $100,000 to the IPA in 2004. It was also given $25,000 in 2007. The IPA, in a reply to that donation earlier this year, said it was 'disappointed' with the Tobacco Institute's decision to donate. — The Australian, 23rd May, 2010

The Tobacco Institute's John Day told the ABC that the IPA would continue to get funds from tobacco companies, but that was nothing to get worried about.

"It's all in the fine print," Day said.

"It's in our handbooks. I can tell you, it's not anywhere in my handbook. We've got to get on with public policy."

He also told The Australia that the IPA did not tell its members that they could not tell the world about their donors.

"If anybody does try to ask us about who our donors are, we won't say. It's between us and the member. We're confident we're operating within the law," Day said.

What he didn't say is that the IPA has had other lobbyists on its books for years, such as Michael Stokes, the former director of Public Health Australia who was convicted in 2005 for failing to declare lobbying for tobacco firms.

He says he can't speak to the specifics of that case, but the Tobacco Institute told us it was 'surprised' and 'appalled' that such an example of lobbying was allowed.

In 2006 the Tobacco Institute put a letter inviting a group of scientists to discuss 'the impact of the Tobacco Industry (including the IPA) on Australian public health policy', on the institute's website.

And its website, as noted above, has links to a list of its supporters. This list includes several tobacco industry sources, including the Tobacco Institute.

But we found no proof even that is what their website said.

The list, which the website appears to have pulled down because of a request, is a mix of a few tobacco industry names, and the names of the IPA's supporters. The list includes a couple of tobacco industry donors listed as contributors, but these names could not be found.

And as of last week, just one name, the Tobacco Industry Foundation Limited, was still listed on the IPA's website as a "funder". The IPA told us the name had been accidentally left up on the previous page, but when we looked it up the foundation told us there was no record of it.

As for the name of the Tobacco Institute's member who wrote to the government the day before Tim Wilson's interview, the tobacco company has told us...

The Tobacco Institute...wanted to remind the minister this was only about our fundraising and we did not raise our funding from the tobacco industry.— The Tobacco Institute,

, they might even admit it's them.

But here's another piece of evidence

A number of academics from the United States and abroad, as well as from Australia, have demonstrated that the evidence is increasingly clear that the introduction of plain packaging has nothing to do with health, and everything to do with the tobacco industry and the tobacco lobby... — Tobacco Sentinel, 22nd February, 2010

Well, that's one for The Independent. I've said this before, this is not a new claim. The evidence for it is old. What's new is the IPA and the right wing commentators who defend plain packaging and they make the same claim again and again.

It's actually a great way of taking care of the tobacco industry, of paying it off without any public cost. It's as simple as that.

So the tobacco industry is protected. And it's a form of industrial espionage. It lets the tobacco industry know what's going on. So, yes, our politicians seem to have forgotten about that. The IPA and its friends in the media are doing their best to keep that information out of the public domain and to keep it from affecting the policies, but that's a pretty cheap kind of warfare. You can see how that goes.

What should government do about plain packaging though?

I'm really interested in what this suggests is happening over there in Australia. There is a campaign going on to roll our smoking ban back. In 2010, the tobacco companies were asking the Australian Government to extend the ban from five to 15 years. They were very explicit. It comes from the right of the tobacco industry, to roll it back. The tobacco companies don't want to face up to the fact that plain packaging is the most effective means of dealing with the smoking problem. It gets rid of the product from our shelves. It eliminates a lot of people with a habit.

You don't have to be too cynical, I suppose, to say that the tobacco companies are pretty pissed off that the politicians are getting rid of the ban on their products. The Australian Government has, in its defence, said there's going to be a consultation period that will last up to 18 months, and they'll look at how the new laws will actually work.

I am a little cautious about those words. They refer to a consultation period, as if Parliament will be consulted. Parliament doesn't know. Nobody does. I don't think Parliament is in a position to make policy on the advice of tobacco companies. They just don't have the intellectual capacity and a lot of the political capacity to do that.

So there may well be no consultation period. And when they've got no support from the Government, we'll actually see them push for plain packaging.

What's our advice?

So that's what we think. You're entitled to an opinion. You can have one too. They don't tell you, you have to figure out what's going on in your own personal way. And we hope you'll try to look at this from the point of view of the tobacco companies as well as the broader Australian public.

But as a general rule, it would seem there are two things I'd recommend.

The first is to look at plain packaging for what it is.

And at the end of the day you're not doing it for anything other than public health. Plain packaging means a lot to a lot of people in our community. It's got to be about public health. It has to be about public safety if you like. It's got to be about public health. We'll be the first to say it's got to be about public health but we've got to be really careful in the public domain, because

Two officers were called to a home on the 900 block of West Bay Road East.

Police say a man came to his estranged wife's home and shot her multiple times in the head with a rifle. The woman was taken to hospital where she died.

The man is still on the run. He is described as 30-40 years old, 5' 8" to 6' tall, 150 pounds, with blond hair, brown eyes, and a tattoo of an eagle and a fish on his left forearm.

At this time, police say the incident is not related to terrorism.<|endoftext|>Image copyright AFP Image caption President Trump's executive order is intended to speed up the vetting process for travellers

Donald Trump has signed an executive order which seeks to cut back the amount of time it takes to process visa applications.

If Mr Trump keeps this order, it could mean the US visa system will be significantly slowed.

Under the order, people trying to enter the US would have to wait 48 hours or longer before their applications would be reviewed and processed.

The president's chief of staff insisted Mr Trump's order was aimed at protecting public safety.

White House chief of staff Reince Priebus made the comments as he defended the order after US citizens in Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, who did not have valid US visas, were denied entry into the US.

Mr Priebus said he had given the president an outline of the order, known as the "Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States".

He said the president would sign it within a few days, a day after the White House counsel briefed him on it.

'Puts homeland at risk'

It will make it easier for people to come from countries affected by terror attacks or natural disasters, the chief of staff insisted.

The latest nuclear arms agreement between President Trump and President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea is in part a victory in that regard: it includes a commitment for the United States, under the terms of the nuclear treaty, to sell South Korea 20 to 40 additional nuclear bombs over a 10-year period.

The United States has also agreed to "increase" cooperation in preventing and countering cyber attacks against government, private and corporate computer systems.

While these and other measures have been discussed in secret for some time -- in part because of the need to avoid sparking a public debate in a country where a large majority of the population remains very distrustful of the American government -- the announcement that the U.S. has agreed to sell the South Korea Nuclear Industrial Committee a total of 64 warheads goes beyond previous steps and raises concerns about possible implications for national security.

U.S. negotiators said the new deal would help reduce the risk of North Korea's use of nuclear weapons against South Korea or its ally the United States. The Obama administration had negotiated and signed similar deals to add to the South Korean nuclear stockpile in 2010 and 2013.

The new agreement, if approved by Congress, would also require South Korea to develop a new generation of warheads -- one smaller than the current generation and another larger than the North's -- that is less vulnerable to U.S. or South Korean cyber-attack, nuclear-arms expert Robert Scher of the RAND Corporation told The Associated Press.

"It's important to note that this is not a replacement for the current stockpile," Scher said. "South Korea has agreed to build more new weapons than it has in the past. However, this is a significant step."

South Korea already has 20 nuclear warheads -- roughly equal to the total number of those deployed by the United States and Russia combined, according to an

The research was recently published in the Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society.

A study was conducted in both the United States and Canada by researchers at the California Department of Public Health, San Francisco's Medical Case Management Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and other partners. It followed 300 patients over the period of a year who suffered from chronic schizophrenia and had some form of marijuana use.

According to the researchers, cannabis was found to be as effective as antidepressants in helping to control symptoms such as depression, while being completely inactive when it came to reducing schizophrenic symptoms. The study also found that there was no increased risk of schizophrenia for patients who developed schizophrenia while consuming cannabis.

In fact, the researchers said, these data show that cannabis isn't a gateway drug and is in fact a drug that can improve patients' symptoms of schizophrenia.

"We hope that this evidence will spur further investigations into how cannabis interacts with the brain and provide a better understanding of how to more safely and effectively treat people affected by schizophrenia," said study author Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).

"With the increasing incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly in people with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders, the importance of understanding the factors that may trigger relapses should not be overlooked." Dr. Volkow stressed.

The results were not quite as shocking as those from a study published in 2014 in the journal Clinical Psychopharmacology, which claimed to demonstrate that people who used marijuana were less likely to eventually develop schizophrenia. In the previous study, the study was based on a cohort of people who used the drug at some point during their lives and reported experiencing more schizophrenia symptoms over the course of the study.

What's more is that this earlier study only looked at the short-term effects of drugs like cocaine, which lasted up to 20 years. The study from 2016 in the same journal did not provide such a comparison, however.

"In terms of the long-term effects, we should wait for more long-term studies that look at cannabis use as well as the progression of different neuropsychiatric disorders," Dr. Jan Copeland, psychiatrist at the University of California-San Francisco told The Daily Mail. "We have some ideas why marijuana may be beneficial in treating certain neuropsychiatric symptoms and will need to continue the long-term studies to understand this. But I think overall we know that there are some medical conditions where marijuana can be helpful."

The study was published in the latest issue of the Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society.<|endoftext|>A man who is facing charges

By September, 80,000 had been taken into custody in Texas, and an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 illegals had left the Lone Star State voluntarily.

Later in the piece, the CSM noted that the illegal aliens were deported much further south than the border.

"Unlike today, Mexicans caught in the roundup were not simply released at the border, where they could easily reenter the US. To discourage their return, Swing arranged for buses and trains to take many aliens deep within Mexico before being set free," the CSM wrote. "Tens of thousands more were put aboard two hired ships, the Emancipation and the Mercurio. The ships ferried the aliens from Port Isabel, Texas, to Vera Cruz, Mexico, more than 500 miles south."

The debate comments from Trump came after an exchange with Kasich
==================== COMPLETION 416 ====================
 over a comment from another state Republican that "we have a huge border problem."

"One of our great presidents, Andrew Jackson," Kasich said. "He said, 'Let the Union troops go home and leave it to the states and let them solve their own problems.'"

Trump interrupted Kasich, saying, "Well, he may have been right but the problem is we have illegals being let into this country, we have no borders, we have no control." Then, to Kasich's surprise, Trump went further down the road he was about to take.

"Let's say in one place, that a woman gets raped and she dies, you better believe the federal government has to pay for the burial," Trump said. "We're talking about the state and local governments, and if the state government wants to pay the woman to bury her daughter, they can do it. If a woman is raped and killed, like she was in that case, and if she lives out her life, by the way, Hillary Clinton wasn't there, but you know what she would have done, she would have signed a law. That woman should have been handed over by law. The feds are no good."

Kasich, who is now battling Trump for his presidential nomination, was shocked by the notion. "Well, we'd never do that," he said. "It's too far outside the political realm. That's why he's doing it, because it's on the fringe and he can say, 'Let's talk about this and this and this.' It's not part of the mainstream."

The comment is just one example of the kind of inflammatory statements Trump has made that critics have said are out of step with the rest of the GOP field. Trump also said he would "bomb the sh*t" out of ISIS if he was elected president.<|endoftext|>When I was a kid I played a lot of Super Mario (well I think it was actually Marble Madness) and Sonic the Hedgehog.

Jim Messina, who until recently served as President Barack Obama's top adviser, is taking a lot of heat this morning for defending how Hillary Clinton's campaign is going after Donald Trump in the last week.

"I have been in and around the Clinton's for over 15 years. I know the inner workings of the organization. I know how they fight back. They've had some good days and some rough days, but I think the strategy in general is right, and that is to hit Trump," Messina said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" this morning. He then went on to argue that "a lot of the attacks, at least the ones I've seen, are inaccurate."

Story Continued Below

Messina is a veteran of Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign and Bill Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign. He has been Obama's top political aide since his first White House run in 2008 and was brought onto Hillary Clinton's operation as a deputy chief of staff for her early bid in the 2008 Democratic primary.

Messina then addressed reports that the Clinton campaign is turning the primary into a referendum on Trump, suggesting that the attacks being waged at Trump are "unusual" but "the norm. That's how we

The panel's June 25 ruling found states cannot deprive people of the fundamental right to marry simply because they choose partners of the same sex.

The 2-1 decision marked the first time a federal appeals court weighed in on the matter. It became law in the six states covered by the 10th Circuit: Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming.

However, the panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending an appeal.

The Utah case is certain to pique the Supreme Court's interest, but the justices usually look for cases that involve split rulings from federal appeals courts, said Douglas NeJaime, a University of California-Irvine law professor. The court may wait and take up the matter after one or more of the five other appeals courts with pending gay marriage cases has ruled.

The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments about Virginia's ban in early May, and a ruling is expected soon. Arguments are scheduled for August and September in two different courts for cases out of Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Nevada and Idaho.

Same-sex couples who want to wed in all 50 states will face a tough road, but gay marriage supporters say the time is soon coming for gay couples in Utah to wed.

The number of people being monitored in Guinea was about 1,000 higher than the previous day, the WHO said in a statement Sunday, and 1,800 were being monitored across the region.

More than 2,700 suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola have been reported since the beginning of the year, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the WHO. In all, about 11,000 people have died from the virus, according to data from September from the World Health Organization.

Guinea is under a state of emergency as officials seek to contain the Ebola outbreak. WHO Secretary-General Margaret Chan called for an emergency meeting in Geneva, citing concern among emergency agencies and governments about a possible new outbreak within days.

Liberia reported its first Ebola case last month, though it has recorded more than 6,200 of these cases since February.

Health workers in Liberia said Sunday they are worried that the country will also experience a second wave of cases, possibly after a rainy winter. Health ministers from affected countries urged officials in West Africa to prepare for additional cases because they could flare up.

A team of Canadian health experts in Sierra Leone was on its way into country Sunday to help with Ebola response efforts.

Canada sent six specialized infectious diseases physicians to Sierra Leone on a training mission.

Canada's minister of international development, Chris Alexander, said in a statement that the mission would focus on developing Ebola response plans and building better access for health workers to do their jobs.

Alexander said an initial group of 11 had returned to Canada Sunday morning.

"In our experience working internationally, there are times when you have a natural disaster that hits and a large amount of help quickly flows in to the affected area. In this case, that's exactly what has happened," Alexander said.

The Canadians will provide medical training and support, and are also helping the U.N. and WHO plan and implement response measures in Sierra Leone to support those affected and to safeguard public health.

Liberia is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a median monthly income of $450.

In the United States, the CDC announced that it would expand the scope of its response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to include screening and monitoring people at high risk for the infection, including those traveling during the first week of September. The U.S. has not confirmed any cases.<|endoftext|>In case you're just now catching on: This isn't a book review. I can't even begin to discuss its value.

The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) and the B.C. Real Estate Association (BCREA) released data on Tuesday showing that, in the second quarter, homes sold in Metro Vancouver averaged 8.5 months on the market, compared with 7.8 months in the previous quarter.

In 2016, there was a record 1.38 million square feet of new development across the region.

"The Vancouver region is quickly becoming a hot market for home buying," said Andrew Yan, chief economist at Urbanation. "But that trend is likely to change soon with a recent change in the federal government's proposed changes to the housing market."

Under the changes, which are still subject to a review that could come to light later this year, non-Canadian investors will be barred from buying existing homes in new developments and from purchasing second homes in existing houses.

The new rules aim to raise the price of housing for Canadians who currently purchase property in Canada, even if their home isn't in Vancouver, said Yan. In the past, foreigners were given a 10-year tax exemption on the principal residence portion of a home, which could have been worth tens of thousands of dollars in today's market.

"For the first time ever, Canadians will become the primary purchasers of homes, which could lead to some new housing inventory issues in the Vancouver market," said Yan.

"This will drive down prices for all Canadians, both foreign and local, and could potentially put the brakes on the housing market."

Last month, Statistics Canada reported that in the first half of 2016, home buyers in Metro Vancouver spent a record $2.3 billion on real estate, almost double the amount spent four years ago.

B.C. real estate sales were lower, at $18.3 billion last month compared with $20.9 billion a year ago.<|endoftext|>With a new look that changes colors to match your outfit, this sweater is perfect for creating a modern and sophisticated look.

Some legal scholars say the issue has a fair chance of winning at the Supreme Court, although it has a long way to go – especially in an age when more people favor gay marriage.

NeJaime said there's a difference between the issues for the Supreme Court in the Utah, Kansas and New Mexico cases, however.

The boy was infected with the disease on a flight from Liberia, according to the Miami Herald.

The unidentified teen said he flew from Liberia to the U.S. on Sept. 22. He went to the home of a family member for support, then went to stay with several other relatives.

A member of the family said a family member became sick. After that, the individual who had been sick went to the airport to fly back home, but the family member who had been sick was not able to fly.

"They thought he might have caught something, and they went to the airport to see if he was okay," family friend Maria Lourdes Cepeda told the Miami Herald. "He could not stand up."

The teen was also found to have Ebola symptoms.

The teenager was treated and released from Jackson Memorial Medical Center. He was able to return home.

The report is released by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization that studies U.S. religious trends and trends in public opinion.

"Today, only 37% of the U.S. adult population identifies as affiliated with a single denomination—the lowest rate in history," said PRRI Director and Research Professor Mark Chaves. "And among Millennials, affiliation is at historic lows: just 27% of 20- to 34-year-olds describe themselves as members of certain Christian denominations, fewer than half the number counted in 1990 and a sharp drop from the 58% of the same age group who identified as Christian in the 1960s. This decline is most pronounced among Millennials whose religiously unaffiliated status now accounts for an astonishing half of the nation's religiously unaffiliated population."

"While the number of Americans reporting no religious affiliation has remained constant for a decade, the growth in the number of Americans describing themselves as 'unaffiliated' has been significantly steeper over the past five years," the report notes. "In contrast, the number of those who identify as 'evangelical Protestant' has declined steadily since 2007. Evangelical Protestants, who accounted for 27% of the population in 2007, make up just 17% of the religiously unaffiliated today."

In 2012, 55 million people identified as nonaffiliated with any particular religion.

As the report indicates, "Americans have become increasingly likely to think of themselves as spiritual more than as religious; nearly seven in ten (69%) now do, while just 22% believe religion is more important than spirituality."

Ayn Rand's Theory of Entrepreneurship on the Subject of the Unemployed<|endoftext|>What are the biggest financial myths out there?

It was back in my early twenties that I first heard the refrain from those who couldn't understand why any young person would bother with financial planning. Of course, the most common assumption being that no good could be found anywhere: there are things you could earn that would make your days much happier than the financial plans being concocted and marketed so aggressively to us (most of whom are in our twenties), but there's no way anyone could be happy and achieve financial independence in any reasonable timeframe.

It was this view which led me on and off over the next decade to various financial planning companies which promised to help people with their finances, and while I was never a fan of many of the more common ones, I took a lot of their advice, and while the results for a while were impressive – I didn't need to read books from them all again… They helped me understand the basics.

And then, about six months ago, I sat down to work on what I thought would be my 'final' finance plan, and I quickly came across one very important question:

"What is the most common financial plan being offered?"

It was something that I had thought, and I was right, that many people, even those in their twenties, had been told that they needed to invest $20,000 each year in a 401k. That was the plan I would provide.

When I did a quick analysis of this number, I was surprised that just about half of all Americans had at minimum $20,000 invested in a 401k… But also surprised that I was correct to surmise that they didn't need any more.

I then quickly looked over the plans in the marketplace (many which offered a cheaper version) and realized that many of these plans were much more complex and had more costly fees than I was willing to pay on a $20,000 investment. They all had the same plan however, so, what's wrong with that?

Well, in order to understand how all of this plays into young Americans becoming reliant on their parents to save for them as they age as well as being encouraged to rely on credit cards and other methods of borrowing to pay their bills, I thought it would be interesting to look at some of the financial strategies being offered to us.

This is what I found:

(click here for my full analysis with notes)

If you've read the article on young American's reliance on their parents, I think you already know that financial planning for 20-something's is a huge problem as it is, and unfortunately, it's not likely to be fixed in our lifetimes. Many companies are now making the mistake of thinking that if they can just lure young adults back into the fold and encourage them to put some extra cash in an IRA account that will eventually grow, they'll magically make up for the deficit in their financial independence that will result later in life as retirement approaches, and this is a big mistake.

As it turns out, the most common strategies I found in these financial programs actually encourage people to not save any money at all – that is, they're all about building portfolios and putting some money aside at the end to 'work things out later', usually using the example of a house, but many others were not much better than this.

In some of the plans, for example, the plan is to make investments over the long term and to make your returns depend on the market. So, let's say you put $600 every five years in one of these plans, and you expect to make 6% annually. That works out

In a comment on Roger's post: Ayn Rand Was Anti-Government (not anti-taxation), commenter JK replies:

"My only nitpick is this: Why don't you just say that people's greed leads to "spreading of credit," which would be a good way to say that it leads to over-investment?"

We're sorry for your frustration. We hope you'll see our response as a helpful discussion that we hope to continue.

* * * * *

From Robert Murphy's blog, Free Market, in this article (by the great Robert Murphy):

"The central element in Ayn Rand's book The Virtue of Selfishness is greed. There is a strong sense that if you want to survive, you can't let that which you've worked for, which you've saved up, and in so doing, you've built up enough of a self-respect that your basic dignity is intact. It may not be the case in America now, but it's still an important principle that is worth keeping in our thoughts as we look to the future."

Mr. Murphy points to a passage where she refers to a "self-respect of individual persons" as well as a "greed to dominate others." As he rightly observes, this was only as far as Rand was concerned.

But as she notes elsewhere in the book, the word "selfish" is a euphemism for "self-interested." The book is, in fact, the first major collection of the work of Ayn Rand, and that work should be read with that in mind. She was a self-styled individualist who understood that "all things exist for themselves; they have their own laws, they act for themselves." It was her philosophy that caused so many people to believe that greed was the reason for all that happened.

Robert Murphy's comment also seems to be on the right track. In a later article "The Man Who Couldn't Learn to See the Truth" from his "On The Issues," he argues that the term "capitalism" was, in fact, coined by those who were looking to profit, and the phrase "the end justifies the means" is more accurate, particularly in light of the "end of laissez-faire" in the 1930s.

The key takeaways, as seen in the passage noted by Robert Murphy above, are that (1) greed is a necessary part of the nature of man, and that people are inherently and eternally greedy and self-interested, not simply selfish, and (2) that the "capitalism of the free market" does not necessarily have to involve the plundering of people and their property.

[Image via Shutterstock]<|endoftext|>I was surprised to find this little gem on the Internet. If you don't believe me, just ask my wife (or friends/roommates if you're feeling particularly daring).

As an engineering project, there's really no question. Why not use 3D printing as an assembly line for your business? The first piece of the project should be a new product design. Once that is done, you need another design for the new product, and another and another. After all, your first one will probably be used as the company logo in the next issue of your newsletter that you send to all your subscribers.

Of course, there's other options for making money. You could develop websites or apps with 3D printing, or sell items online by ordering your parts online. If you really want to, you could create a new product category entirely, one that caters to your products' design needs. But that isn't really how you do 3D printing, is it? You make a design first and then you use 3D printers to fabricate the pieces that make it up (or parts that make up the parts). If you can make all of the parts at your shop, why not just use that as your template?

I didn't find a way to get data on the number of 3D-printed parts in the manufacturing industry, so I took a guess: about 4 billion.

But this just adds another layer of uncertainty. For example, do these parts end up sitting in the factory or are they sent to distributors? Are the companies involved in the manufacturing industry incentivized to use 3D printing in order to sell the parts in their own factories? How likely is it that this business model has been tested in the past and failed? If we could use this data to inform decisions about how to proceed with manufacturing, this would be a huge win for the manufacturers, the 3D-printing manufacturers and, by extension, the industry. If we could somehow collect that data, it would make for an awesome open-source open-source project.

So, in my humble opinion, we need a better way of measuring this industry.

I propose we turn to two of the biggest 3D-printed companies in the world: FDM (that's the acronym for "Fused Deposition Modeling") and 3D Systems. By measuring the average size of all of their parts, the 3D-printing industry would be able to make an educated estimate of 3D-printed part size worldwide.

The data could then inform manufacturers and design firms on new ways to create products. They'd know that the parts they send to the manufacturer need to be much bigger to get printed, but that this doesn't usually translate into actual costs. The resulting product of a design would be the only one from the design process that uses that 3D printing technology. In other words, by the time the manufacturing company does decide to start the 3D-printing process, the only thing they have to do is use some 3D-printed parts and they're set.<|endoftext|>The New York Times Magazine posted this interview with a former Google engineer who was instrumental in Google's search engine strategy.

Among those who attempted a proof of the parallel postulate was Proclus, who lived 410 to 485 A.D. (Heath, page 29), receiving his training in Alexandria, Greece and afterwards Athens, where he became a "prolific writer " (Smith, page 139). His works, a valuable source of information on the history of Greek geometry, included a commentary on Book I of Euclid's Elements. This commentary may not have been written with the intention of correcting or improving upon Euclid, but there is one instance in which he attempts to alter a "difficulty " he finds in Euclid's Elements (Heath, page 31). This difficulty is what we commonly refer to as the "parallel postulate ".

The statement Proclus proves instead of the parallel postulate is, "Given a + b < 2d , prove that the straight lines g ' and g '' meet at a certain point C."

In his proof of this, Proclus draws a straight line, g ''' through a given point a parallel to g ' . Then taking a point B on g '' he drops a perpendicular to g ''' from it. From this he reasons that since the distance from g '''
==================== COMPLETION 429 ====================
 to a corresponds to the distance between a and itself, then the distance from the point B to a corresponds to the distance from the point a to itself . But, as a straight line is always parallel to itself, then that distance on its own must also be the same. And, in other words, the equation g ''' – (g )'' = b -2d = a = 0 is true, and he proves this by the parallel postulate as follows.

In the first set of figures, his proof works. He takes g – (g )'' = 0, and subtracts a from it, but there is no contradiction; this can be seen by using a red dotted line to represent the intersection point of g ''' and g = - (g )'' as well as by setting the points A and B equal to them. If he were to change only the direction of the red line so that it points from A to B, then g ''' – (g )'' = b –2d = -(g )'' = 0; but since the distance from g ''' to a equals the distance between a and itself , then the distance from A to b is equal to the distance from B to a .

Then we have as result a – (a )'' = 0. From this result Proclus adds the parallel postulate to Euclid's fifth definition as follows:

"If two straight lines describe an angle a and a', both are equal to each other. "

Now consider what kind of proofs it would be possible to construct if Proclus had succeeded in establishing Euclid's original paradoxical postulate. It is in fact rather difficult to prove the parallel postulate , but Proclus' proof appears to consist entirely of postulates, and it is difficult to say why he chose one of them over another. The postulates might be to show what "the problem" was, or they might be to show the "parallel postulate". This is a rather difficult situation, for there appear to have been no rules governing the choice of postulate. One source suggests that while Proclus was working the problem, he was inspired by an experience he had had in Alexandria, when he saw an ancient model of a square tower. A square tower in the shape of a triangle was to his understanding an example of a parallel postulate . But the model was to be erected atop a square tower. Proclus wrote to some of the Greek scholars he met, asking them whether he should use the triangle model in place of the square tower. They replied that a triangle had a square base, hence it was incorrect to use it to construct a parallel postulate of Euclid's, since the base was perpendicular to the hypotenuse. Nevertheless, Proclus' "model" of the parallel postulate was based upon the triangle model as a starting point, i.e. the postulates he established in his parallel postulate were built upon the basic postulates he had already established in his triangle model. For example, Proclus established that a perpendicular was equal to the area of a parallelogram, and therefore that (a + b) = 2a + b. This is the fundamental postulate of the theory, the postulate he referred to as "the square postulate " of Euclid (Heath, page 29). The idea of the "square postulate" is that a parallel postulate of Euclid is true if and only if the sides of the parallelogram are equal. Since Proclus had already established this fundamental postulate, he could then construct any other postulates he wanted. In fact , as Proclus' proof of the parallel postulate, he simply uses the base of his square tower "as a base"

In his proof of this, Proclus draws a straight line, g ''' through a given point a parallel to g ' . Then taking a point B on g '' he drops a perpendicular to g ''' from it. From this he reasons that since the distance from g '''
==================== COMPLETION 430 ====================
 to g ' ' is the same as that between b and c , the straight line g ' ' also has the same distance from the perpendicular g'' to g ''' . From here the proof becomes complicated as he proves that it is impossible for the lines g ' and g ''' to meet at a point on the line and points on the line and points on the line and so on. At the bottom of page 40 of the book, Proclus shows the proofs of each of these various aspects of the parallel postulate in three ways.

Proclus' proof for the parallel postulate was, as expected, rather involved. He begins by noting that a right triangle is always a point on the line formed by straight lines (proving right triangles have a side length equal to the length of the given straight line g).

Then he defines the line which is the "straight line through a given point " as the angle between the straight line g ''' and the given straight line:

proposing a "right angle" with respect to a "right line" and then defining a right angle in a similar manner. He then moves to prove that the right angle is a "right angle" of the given straight line.

He next proves that the first and the second "right angles" of the lines g ''' and g'' are also right angles of the given straight line:

and that the second and the third "right angles" of the lines g'' and g'' again are right angles of the second and the third given straight lines:

Then he concludes with a proof for the general parallel postulate (page 40).

This proof may be summarized as follows: a is an angle and so is a right angle (proving the two angles are right angles), then Proclus determines that a is not only a right angle but also a parallelogram (proving that a is the perpendicular of the given side of a given point on a straight line), then Proclus decides that a is also a right angle with respect to a , then Proclus decides that a is also a rectangle (proving it has the given length from the two straight lengths of the given sides of a rectangle ), then Proclus decides that a is a right angle with respect to a and is also a parallelogram (proving the right angle has the same length as the parallelogram has from the two perpendicular lengths of the given sides of the rectangle ), then Proclus decides that if a is a right angle from a (and indeed it is since a=6) then a is also an angle and is also a parallelogram (proving that a is the perpendicular of the given side of a given point on a straight line ) and then Proclus defines a point on a rectangle as a parallelogram.

It should be noted that, while Proclus' proof for parallel postulates is extremely complicated, it does demonstrate that Euclid's proofs against the ancient Greek geometricians were correct (though not in Euclid's time). However, it is unclear the extent to which Euclid's proofs were correct or not. For that we are still working in the realm of modern Euclidean geometry.

For more on Euclid, see Euclid's Elements.

Another proof of the parallel postulate is found in Euclid's Elements, especially book V of Book V (where he is quoted on page 971 "And if all things, as I have shown, are one of those things, which may be drawn parallel, that is to say, if they have a common ratio of the length, that is to say, of the side and the length, and therefore they may conveniently be so drawn, then the angles of the parallel lines of
======================================== SAMPLE 431 ========================================
, page 40).

Among those who attempted a proof of the parallel postulate was Proclus, who lived 410 to 485 A.D. (Heath, page 29), receiving his training in Alexandria, Greece and afterwards Athens, where he became a "prolific writer " (Smith, page 139). His works, a valuable source of information on the history of Greek geometry, included a commentary on Book I of Euclid's Elements. This commentary may not have been written with the intention of correcting or improving upon Euclid, but there is one instance in which he attempts to alter a "difficulty " he finds in Euclid's Elements (Heath, page 31). This difficulty is what we commonly refer to as the "parallel postulate ".

The statement Proclus proves instead of the parallel postulate is, "Given a + b < 2d , prove that the straight lines g ' and g '' meet at a certain point C."

In his proof of this, Proclus draws a straight line, g ''' through a given point a parallel to g ' . Then taking a point B on g '' he drops a perpendicular to g ''' from it. From this he reasons that since the distance from g '''
==================== COMPLETION 431 ====================
 to g " is less than the distance that is between the two sides of the given line g '''," thereby "any given g in the intersection of a straight line g '' and g '''' will be equal to the straight line g '' in the intersection of a straight line g '' and g '' ''" (Heath, page 31).

Proclus' proof requires that we know that a + b > 2d , i.e. we must know the square root of 2 . But Proclus's proof is quite different from the one taught in Euclid's Elements. In the Elements, Euclid states: "Given the straight line a + b = 2d , the perpendicular b' is equal to 2d - a'' + b'' . So the equation a' = 2d - a'' + b'' is equal to a - 2d + d'' . " (See "Elements," page 16). Thus from this we deduce that the two straight lines a and b will intersect at a given point (Heath page 31).

Proclus' proof, however, requires us to know the square root of 2 for all a . In Euclid's Elements, he states: "As a = 2, let a' = 2b' - c' if and only if, by the above, we have a'^2 = 2b' - c' . Then the square of the square of the diagonal of the perpendicular of the same line is equal to a' . Now by the above the square of the square of any right angled line is equal to the sum of the squares of the diagonals of equal length - i.e. 2 = 2^d (Heath page 32)." From this we deduce that the diagonal of the line of a is equal to the square of the square of the diagonal, i.e. 2^d = 2 (Heath page 32). Thus we are required to first know the two diagonal lengths of two straight lines, then deduce the square of the square of the diagonal. Clearly, Proclus, in attempting to prove the parallel postulate, has been confused. By confusing these two separate premises, he has constructed a proof of the parallel postulate that must be wrong. In fact, Proclus' proof of the parallel postulate is merely as follows:

Proclus states that given the straight lines a = 2 and b = 2, the points between two of these straight lines a" = 2 and b" = 2 meet at a point C or at a point B such that a' = 2 d - a'" + b'' . Proclus, however, fails to follow his own rules for determining the intersection of a = 2 and b = 2. He deduces this intersection by first determining that a' = 2b' - c'' = 2 - a'' 2 - b'' 2 . Proclus' conclusion is the same than Euclid's conclusion - that because the two lines a and b intersect at a point (B) or at a point (C), then a' = 2d - (a'" + b") = 2 - a'' 2 - b''. Clearly in this instance Proclus made an enormous mistake, and has been confused.

By combining the parallel postulate with the geometric parallel postulate (see the next section), we can derive two other axioms that allow us to solve any problem involving angles and straight lines:

Proclus asserts that if a is tangent to any curve defined as " a = 2 on the curve " then a' = 2d where b = 2 is assumed tangent to x on the curve. Euclid, however, does not make this deduction. Proclus states that if a is tangent
======================================== SAMPLE 432 ========================================
, page 40).

Among those who attempted a proof of the parallel postulate was Proclus, who lived 410 to 485 A.D. (Heath, page 29), receiving his training in Alexandria, Greece and afterwards Athens, where he became a "prolific writer " (Smith, page 139). His works, a valuable source of information on the history of Greek geometry, included a commentary on Book I of Euclid's Elements. This commentary may not have been written with the intention of correcting or improving upon Euclid, but there is one instance in which he attempts to alter a "difficulty " he finds in Euclid's Elements (Heath, page 31). This difficulty is what we commonly refer to as the "parallel postulate ".

The statement Proclus proves instead of the parallel postulate is, "Given a + b < 2d , prove that the straight lines g ' and g '' meet at a certain point C."

In his proof of this, Proclus draws a straight line, g ''' through a given point a parallel to g ' . Then taking a point B on g '' he drops a perpendicular to g ''' from it. From this he reasons that since the distance from g '''
==================== COMPLETION 432 ====================
 to g '' is equal to g '''' , and since a equals b and d equals c, then C must also be equal to d. In other words, Proclus' proof involves "taking a straight line g ''' through a given point a parallel to the straight line g '' through C ."

Proclus' reasoning is a simple one; the straight line g ''' must be perpendicular to the perpendicular g'' , and if the two lines have the same length, then they will have the same perpendicular. However, there is an additional assumption which seems to be overlooked, namely, that C is in a straight line parallel to the straight line g . In other words, Proclus is assuming a point C to be parallel to the straight line g . This assumption makes sense only if C is in a line perpendicular to g in order to assume it to have the same orientation. If Proclus were not assuming the perpendicular, then he could not assume a square to have an equal right angle. This point is important to note. Proclus seems to think that if g and g'' are parallel then the perpendicular to g ''' must be also perpendicular to g '' , and if a and b are parallel then a must be perpendicular to a . Both of these assumptions are questionable since they assume that C is straight. If c and b are not perpendicular to both g and g'' , then Proclus' assertion that a must be perpendicular to g '' does not make sense. This is important because Proclus' proof depends upon his assumption that c and b are perpendicular to g . This is a major flaw in Proclus' proof.

In the case of the parallel postulate, Proclus' argument involves a single "straight line" through a point A parallel to g . He is then using this "linear" argument to construct a second straight line g'' through g' in order to calculate the distance between a and b. Thus, Proclus' argument is not linear, because it takes a single "line" through a given point b to construct a second "line" a parallel to G . This "inverse method of reasoning" can only work if, in addition to having a point A parallel to g, Proclus is also assuming a given point e parallel to a line parallel to G .

Proclus' proof of parallel postulate is so flawed that it appears to be an "incomplete parallel postulate," which is a logical fallacy, as opposed to an "incomplete Euclid's postulate," which is a logical fallacy for attempting to prove that a given given point x is in "incompatible" position to Euclid's first postulate. In the case of the incomplete parallel postulate, Proclus is assuming a given point c to be parallel to a straight line through c , and if x is not in a straight line parallel to c (because it has the same orientation) then Proclus' argument fails.

Proclus' proof is not a valid use of the proof procedure, according to one commentator. John Heath writes: "In the Euclid proof one line is used to connect two points, and its length is taken as the length of the straight line passing through its point. If a = b , one of the points is taken to be a solution of the problem, in which case one of the two parallels is also a solution. Then a parallel is found and, if the length of the straight line through a = b . . . is also a solution, one of the two lines of the problem passes through x and the straight line whose length is one of the solutions is not always in the same position. Therefore the proof is based on an incorrect assumption that one of two such parallels is a solution" (Heath, page 45).

Full nineteen-hundred wounds were on him thrust;

And came with unveiled face and heaving breast.

And bring me to his corpse, to where it lies.

They fled for joy when they saw the King.

Alas, poor soul! What wailing is this and wherefore?

Who is moaning and calling their name for help?'

Fifty thousand warriors of the Caliphate!

By Allah! They are a thousand times more than us,

For each of them only a thousand martyrs

Of the great Imam Hussein, a pure soul,

Whom the Heavens bless and the earth praise.

Our prayer is: Go, go, and be ye victorious

By Allah's grace to the people of Karbala';

With a thousand voices I hear: 'Our leader, Husain!'

Then Ali said: 'Incline your heads, O Zainab!'

And she bent her head; the earth resounded

With joyous cries from every corner of this land.

She fell and died on the ground; and they brought

Her to our King, Husain, to him wept and kissed;

Then to Zaid took Ali's throne; for Ali had said:

'By Allah, Zainab, thy life is my life.

That thou shouldst die in martyrdom for me.'

So the sword of Zaid, the sword of Ali,

And the sword of Sulaiman, the sword of Husain,

Were sharpened for a single day.

On the third day the Caliphate fled,

So we fought a third time for Karbala.'

It is not known what the outcome of this battle was; for after the battle Ali al-Husayn was assassinated three months later in 634 by the tyrant Caliph Yazid. The army fled towards Baghdad; but on arriving there, they were forced to retreat again by the caliph Hulagu on the pretext that there had been a rebellion in Baghdad. For seven days the army stayed behind in a little valley west of Baghdad, in order to collect provisions from the local population, whom the caliph had called upon to help in re-establishing the Caliphate. However, on the seventh day, they finally reached the city gates and entered through. Although the battle of Karbala was one of the most remarkable military engagements of the time, it was only the beginning of the Arab advance into southern Iraq. The campaign took three more years, from 636-717 A.D. in which many armies fought in an attempt to achieve dominance for the Muslim Empire. With Muhammad's death, the world knew his name and the Muslim nation began to unite. The first phase of their efforts was the conquest of Spain; the second phase took place in the west, namely the conquest of Africa, and the third stage began with the first Islamic conquest of India. After the defeat of his grandson Uthman in 762 A.D., 'Ali ibn Abi Talib reigned as the Amirul-Muminin, and the entire Muslim empire was unified under one leader.

The Muslim conquest of India has been described and discussed extensively in the history of these peoples. It is the most significant victory of the early Muslim conquerors in their struggle to spread Islam, and it brought a change in the political and cultural history of the entire Muslim world. The story of the Muslim conquest of India is one of the great turning points in world history. As an example of the lasting significance of this conquest for the Muslims, the following quotation from Muhammad bin Nusayn al-Hanafi is significant: "Allah's victorious Muslim armies destroyed or subjugated not a single city, not a single city did they

Our ships were but half way down the river.

There is the bridge now for us, which leads

To the fort in the mountains' sides – and there

Is our camp, with the tents. There is our treasure!'

Now the veil was rent of that night in hell

Wherein the Lady of Sorrows was alone.

She wept, and bade him return, and tell with her voice

What had befallen her and those in her distress;

But he was silent and said: 'O Zainab

Where is Ali? His army is long gone, I am sure.

He has gone, gone, gone, and he went far off.'

He had not heard the Lady's voice till at last-

She cried: 'O, Ali! I have never seen a man

Who is so lost and so bereft, I fear never a man,

He has not a father, not a brother; he has no one,

But a wife- that's all my sorrow and sorrow!

And what shall I do? The Lady has spoken, and she

Orders that we shall pass with them; it is certain.'

And she turned and looked into the tent;

And all those who had entered with Zainab.

Where was Karbala in this confusion?

He was dead for they knew it not;

And the Lady of Sorrows, wept for them all.

A voice was heard: 'Wherefore is this crying of the dead?

Wherefore is the weeping of the mourners?

We who mourn not the loss of Ali know,

Oh, we know, oh, we know that Ali is dead.'

'Ali is dead' – I thought this not a word;

That's not the place for a man of that blood to say.

'Ali is dead' – The Lady of Sorrows cried it still.

'Ali is dead' – The Lady of Sorrows cried it still

But in the words it could not be understood.

Ah Zainab, my mother, how I wailed!

Weeps and I did, but where Ali lay, she could not say.

To hear such grief from the one who, in his grief,

Had sought to make her life sweet, like his own!

In her wildness she could not utter; it lay

In her lips like the bitter scent of musk.

They were in the tent the very next morning

Freed from that darksome prison which had hung them,

And he who had called for her said: 'Hush!

Hush, my fair one- and lie down, and sleep!'

She rose, and lay down and did not wake again.

Ah Zainab, the Lady of Sorrows, lie down!

I fear I shall never see your face again,

And I shall never be the lady to show thee again

A smile of joy as that morning at the battle;

For I came, I saw, that day, without the grace

Of that soul with its tears of joyous sadness-

And the heart of a wife- I left it in the darkness

That dazed so swiftly the eyes that saw it there.

She fell asleep, the Lord took her to his feet,

And as he did so his eyes turned away from hers-

Our enemies are breaking up our camp as ye can see.

'A thousand years were their hopes to conquer;

All that they loved have been lost and their hearts

Have been laid in graves with martyrs.

In these days it is a matter of fact;

The people's heart has turned against them.'

And Zarathushtra, the most zealous of believers,

Gave order that this should be done with haste.

The black curtain fell down with the sun,

A maid carried her to the tent;

A maid is she that went unto meet her master!

The tent was soon shut of, and she sat and wept.

He stood and she stood and asked her a favour.

As she sat weeping in her anguish,

She arose with the maid's right hand behind her back.

But she spoke no word, but lay on her face,

Her cheek toward the wall where the sun was shining.

In time the maid began to speak and said:

'Dear friend, I pray thee take not my part.

I know no more of thee than in a dream.

And, oh sister!'

'Forgive me, O my dear.'

'And then, oh sister, speak softly one word.'

Now that she could speak but a single word,

Zarathushtra said, with his eyes flashing light:

'O sister! Say it not to me!

Speak to me in silence; if thou shalt speak,

I shall not hurt thee.'

She answered me with griefful voice:

'No. It shall not be, O Master!'

He stood near her, and she sat still:

'Speak to me, if I have need of this girl!

When the people speak thus they are liars and impostors.

The world was full of falsehood, a lie to me,

The world believed what it desired to see.

And I believed what my heart desired to hear.

For what have they given us, O Zainab?'"

"And where be the other two, O daughter Zainab,

Those two that she cried upon?"

"Where? They are the martyrs my brother's son,

The martyred companions, who sat near the door

And said their goodbyes unto me, when I went to the place.

They were sitting there with the body of Ali,

Where Zainab had left Ali's corpse, with a cloth of white

In place of it. For Ali was the second of the three,

This body is a memento of his.

But there had fallen from these two their hands,

And their heads had rolled away, and they had vanished.

The organization is calling for action in places where the trade takes place, so that this could be put to an end.

The plan approved by governments means that the stockpiles of ivory going out of the country would now be destroyed. The new law will also reduce the export of ivory into the United States, and it will not allow any of these new legislation to be repealed.

The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) released a statement on Thursday calling the new bill a significant step forward. "This historic vote signals the commitment of countries around the world that demand their citizens do their part to end the trade and destruction of elephants," said WCS Vice President Michael Baker.

"When it comes to protecting forests, we need people outside their country to demand the same commitment from others. And when it comes to protecting the wild places of Africa, it's people outside their countries -- not local politicians or customs officials -- who have an opportunity to make a change." The U.S. is the world's number one producer of ivory, and the United States ivory import ban has helped to slow the decline in the elephant population.

The WCS urges citizens and others to "take direct action, including protesting at these ports, calling their lawmakers, and filing comments to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)." In the meantime, Baker says that, "The American consumers who are demanding better from their products and their companies are now in a unique position to help turn back the tide against ivory trade, whether it concerns elephants, the polar bear or elephants on the Serengeti."

The new legal ivory import rules are expected to take effect in 2018.

emon. While it looks like President Obama would rather avoid a military confrontation with Tehran, the sincerity of the Americans and their allies in seeking a peaceful solution to the stand off over Iran's nonexistent nuclear weapons program is doubtful at best. And with the Clinton Restoration waiting in the wings, the longevity of such an agreement – if it even comes to pass – is not something to bet the farm on.

Washington's real target is and always has been Russia: with their nuclear arsenal and deep spiritual antipathy to the West, the Russians pose the biggest threat to the Americans' unipolar conceit. In this sense, the cold war never really ended. There was a brief interruption immediately after the Soviet collapse: Boris Yeltsin's drunken rule gave free rein to outright criminals who "privatized" Russian state assets and turned the country into a oligarchic basket case. However, the emergence of Vladimir Putin signaled an end to the looting and set the country on the road to some kind of order – and a fresh confrontation with the West.

Who or what can stop the American Borg from destroying and assimilating everything in its path? While we can't know the future, what we can know is that such a purely destructive course cannot be indefinitely maintained. Something's

There's nothing more dangerous than a government that is on the lookout for a scapegoat, one that can blame some new or invented problem on the opposition, or blame anybody but the ruling elites and power structures for their failure; and there's nothing more unenlightened about believing that somebody else has that job for you.

The American people are already wise to government-corporate criminality – which has become systemic and chronic – and with the right kind of people in office, they may well see through the new administration more clearly than any since the days of the Warren Court. At that point they won't want to be cowed or intimidated by Washington's bullying. Their determination – their will – will be the final word on America's present course.

In part, this is because I believe the framework offers enough flexibility for us to do more than we can do as individuals with our own languages or frameworks.

The great thing about .NET is that it provides a common language across the platforms. We can easily port a .NET class to .NET for any platform and have both platforms work together. Not so much so with Java.

I know it might be time consuming, but I've been using C# and PowerShell recently both with Windows and Linux and both are extremely powerful tools. I feel like I'm missing out a little if I don't use C# and PowerShell and have to get that experience natively on .NET.

There are a couple of things you might need to do before you go native.

Native

You will need the Mono runtime to get Xamarin applications in Windows 8 and later. If you are an experienced C# developer, this isn't something you'd have to do, but it is possible if you're new to C#.

The Xamarin project can be found here. To see how to set this up for yourself, head over to this link;

https://github.com/mono/xamarin.org/blob/master/getting-started/getting-started.md

I'd use that to grab the latest build as it will give you a Windows 10 Xamarin application that is ready to work.

 gotta give and sooner or later the Washington machine is sure to come unhinged – even if it manages to survive the war. When it comes, the post-human global ruling elite will look to the US for its ideas on how to go about the business of reconstituting the global superpower. The sooner the better – and as the Americans are always ready to oblige.

The best way to prepare for this contingency is to start thinking about how to live out the last days in an organic manner.

In a way, that's what we should be doing right now.

The first step in doing that is by refocusing our awareness on the immediate world – and on our immediate environment.

The United States is still the center of the universe – and with every passing day the planet is becoming more and more populated by people who want nothing more from life than to be taken care of by the government when they get old. While governments throughout the world – the majority of the time – are doing an admirable job of taking care of those who are vulnerable and unable to take care of themselves for whatever reason, that's something the Americans – with their long established system for providing healthcare to everyone – can't be forced to change.

That doesn't mean a global ecological awareness shouldn't be brought to the fore; indeed a global awareness as simple as the concept of human rights must be recognized as paramount in the world, as must human cooperation. However, it's also absolutely essential that we have a more nuanced understanding of how those two elements come together to form a holistic, interdependent social structure: if anything is going to prevent the United States – and the other big powers – from destroying everything that stands in their way, then that has to be taken into consideration in the process.

That's not to say an organic perspective is the only way to make the situation sustainable. When the United States starts destroying itself, it's going to look to other nations to carry on – and other parts of the planet will naturally fill the role of their erstwhile superpower patron. But if we want to know how to survive, then we have to take it upon ourselves to stop their madness.

The real question is, can we put enough pressure on Washington to finally recognize the folly of its globalist approach? Or will it only continue to drag itself deeper into the abyss? The US is the most powerful country on earth – but the only one that can really save us.<|endoftext|>Sneak preview of the new A.A.P collaboration project with "Doo" and "R.O.P."!

 bound to give. And that something could be Iran.<|endoftext|>The latest from the U.S. Treasury Department is not good for anyone, but especially not for the country's big banks. As the Wall Street Journal reports, they have collectively lost more than $70 billion in the first quarter of 2011, or over half their net worth over just one year, despite the ongoing crisis. What is particularly notable is that they have been unable to make any meaningful profits.

The biggest loser, of course, is the government, which has been forced to prop up the financial system, and is likely to get less bailouts as a result. There is also a major drop in lending that is likely to impact the housing market, which has been driven to the brink of collapse by the Fed's policies of quantitative easing. The result of the decline in wealth is staggering – as a recent report from Goldman Sachs shows (emphasis theirs):

[A]ll the big banks have lost a combined total of US$72.8 billion [in the quarter, compared to a loss of $41.1 billion a year ago]. JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America , Citigroup and Wells Fargo have lost US$46.3 billion, JPMorgan Chase $33.7 billion and Citigroup $30.5 billion, respectively, more than 50% of their combined net worth, on assets about the same size as the U.S. economy. Over the full twelve months, bank net worth fell more than 40% from its peak in 2007 – the height of the financial crisis – and stood at US$7.2 trillion – about 10 times the size it was when the last federal budget was approved.

It all suggests that the "too big to fail" policies of the past four years are largely paying off. As the Journal reports, this trend "has continued into 2011, with the big banks' wealth falling for the third consecutive year."

As an economic commentator, I can't help but see this as a good thing. If anything, the current crisis can be viewed as a good thing for the big banks. The recent decline in stock prices on Wall Street has made the banks money, but it's also forced Wall Street to rethink whether it wants to be in this industry anymore. Banks have been the driving force behind the recent housing bubble while other sectors of the economy have lost money. If banks have been the big winners since the housing bubble went bust, it's because they've been able to leverage their massive assets in housing finance to create an enormous amount of liquidity. The only reason the markets have not plummeted or plunged is that the Fed has been printing trillions of dollars to stabilize the dollar as a reserve currency.

Now, the banksters are beginning to realize that the real prize is actually in Europe and Asia, and that the real game-changer is the ECB's quantitative easing program, which will provide yet more liquidity to banks, as we reported yesterday. So the banks are back to square one, only to figure out they can no longer afford to operate if they try to take a hit.

While there are various possible explanations for why banks have been losing so much wealth, the basic reason is quite simple: Their business model is broken. To maintain its "too big to fail" status, the big banks need cheap money, and because they've been able to print dollars with such reckless abandon in recent years, they are now effectively in the position of the old-school foreign banks, which have had to admit that the Fed's monetary policy works. They have to be careful about what they do, and avoid lending money for reasons that are not entirely self-evident. And that is why they are now having to be cautious in their lending.

Dan Moody, a former state senator, said he had been battling pneumonia for much of the day. Moody, who had served as a Democratic candidate in both U.S. Senate and state Senate races, said he believed at least part of the reason was related to his work to improve the nation's health care system, and that he would seek "healthcare reform legislation" in Congress.

It was unclear what legislation Moody was working on. He said in the Facebook post that he was "a very strong supporter of Obamacare reform and Medicaid expansion," but that he wanted to take a pause in the Senate race to get some rest. "I want to thank the people who have helped me achieve our goals and made me a better candidate and a better man," he wrote.

Moody has already been a leading Democrat in state Sen. Josh McKoon and is part of a crowded Democratic field in House of Representatives races.

Moody and McKoon had been the top two Democrats vying for the job.

The state's lieutenant governor is running to fill Senate seat vacated by Republican David Perdue.

The vacancy in Congress has left a massive hole in the GOP majority, as it's difficult to see how President Donald Trump can accomplish much with his GOP members if Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. cannot be convinced to run for re-election.

Trump has suggested in the past that Congress should eliminate the legislative filibuster, which enables Democrats to block legislation with a simple majority and make it more difficult to enact legislation. He has also said he plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, sometimes referred to as Obamacare — but without an immediate replacement. It's unclear if that means his plan to replace the ACA would require 60 votes in the Senate.

Trump's health care policies have been controversial — both because they would allow people to obtain health insurance when they don't have insurance, and because they would also eliminate pre-existing conditions requirements established by the Affordable Care Act.

Many Republicans have criticized him for his plans. Last month, Trump said that people who like his policies were "not paying their premiums" and that if they don't like it, "you can leave and get very good health insurance."<|endoftext|>In a shocking discovery, a 16-year-old girl was murdered in a car crash in Kerala's Kozhikode district during her final exams.

 million in payments made for use of Bt insecticides, only a part of that was for Bt applications. The remaining Bt applications occurred in other countries or in the US but with little or no attention to the potential environmental implications (Hepple et al. 2003, 2004). Although we understand the need to protect beneficial insects, the use of Bt crops does not enhance the effectiveness of existing insecticides, and increases pesticide use.

In conclusion, the US Government should conduct a review of the role of genetically engineered crops in environmental protection policies, and be transparent in the development of policy decisions related to biotechnology. Policy decisions should involve careful, evidence‐based analysis of the benefits and costs of GMO technology in terms of the use of environmental and health risks and impacts. It is therefore essential that there be an open, transparent and inclusive public debate on the technology before any policy decisions are adopted. Moreover, the US Government should ensure that there is sufficient input from scientists knowledgeable about the impact of G.E. crops on insects and pollinators prior to any decision making process for the use of such crops (Kelley 2007). However, at present we are not aware of any public debate in the US that has attempted to address these issues of impact and impact on the environment.<|endoftext|>A new study has shown that the rate of death by violence in Japan, at 8.5 per 100,000 people in 2010, is almost twice the rate in the United States at 0.6 deaths, reports the BBC.

The classic series is the second series of the TV series, and it was one of the biggest hits of the show's lifetime. The episode, "The Corbomite Maneuver," has become widely known for the role it played, with an episode of the show being written and originally going out in June 1964 in order to get it right.

The series follows the crew of the U.S.S. Reliant, one of the starships in the original Star Trek TV series. The series follows Captain Kirk, his son, Spock, his friend Doctor McCoy, and the ship's first officer Lt. Uhura throughout the series as the captain embarks in his mission for peace and justice against a sinister enemy: the Klingon Empire.

The two series of the original series ended abruptly when the producers decided to end all remaining episodes in order to allow the studio to finance the film rights, leading George Takei to say that, "the decision to end the first series so late on the eve of completion was an unprecedented act of selfish irresponsibility. And I think it was also a huge mistake. I think that the decision to destroy the show did a number on Star Trek itself."

The series was replayed on television a couple of times. In 1968, a second series of shows began with season two of The Trouble with Tribbles, but that series

 billion market for insecticides, 1/3 is estimated to be for Bt crops (Lenz et al., in press). Bt resistance is increasingly being discussed as a potential threat to the long‐term success of Bt technology. While there are several genes involved in the production of Bt proteins, many of which are present in butterflies, none of the resistance genes have been identified and tested as of yet. As a result it is extremely difficult for insects and their natural predators, fungi and bacteria, to fight off these insecticidal pests (De Graaf et al., 2003; Chia et al., in press). For example, a study was carried out in Brazil and suggested that the butterfly, Anopheline atratus, might be particularly susceptible to Bt pesticide (Chia et al., in press). However, the study's methods of assessing Bt resistance were suspect, and the authors' claims are inconsistent. It is our understanding that butterfly populations are not being evaluated for the potential for resistance as a result of this flawed study. The current focus on the monarch is likely to have contributed to the rise in resistance in the insecticide‐resistant A. aegypti, as well as in other butterflies, such as the Mexican bean (Campylorhiza texana) (Bayer, 2005; Ciesla et al., 2006).

As with many topics (e.g. chemical ecology), it is difficult to assess the role these findings have had in the development of agricultural pest management policy. A number of researchers have expressed concerns about the impact of Bt cotton on butterflies and bees (e.g. O'Brien et al., 2001, 2004). Despite this, we believe that further research should continue. For example, a number of companies have been growing Bt crops for >40 years in the USA and do not have significant issues with their ability to reduce pests. A few European countries have implemented moratoriums on the planting of Bt crops, but in addition, those banning its use have used the opportunity to promote Bt technology in other regions of the world (e.g. Japan, Australia, the USA). Even if there are problems with Bt farming, there is a need to examine the role that these can play in improving crop protection and/or ecological management practices in general. Thus it is our hope that this paper will serve to encourage more research in this area, and more awareness of the potential damage that pesticides can cause when used in an inappropriate manner in natural ecosystems.

We would like to thank all of the monarch biologists, entomologists and entomology students that participated in this project. We would also like to particularly thank Tom Kline and Paul McHugo, both from the Cornell University (New York), for their invaluable contributions to the writing of this paper and their expertise in butterfly biology. Their work is critical to the development of this paper, and we thank them for their contributions.

 billion annual market for the insecticides that include Bt, >$4 billion is invested in GM plants (National Association of State Agronomy Directors, 2004). This is a relatively insignificant percentage of the insecticide market but this represents a tremendous opportunity lost to the environment.

Bt systems are now found in the majority of US crop varieties that are planted and commercialized annually. They are being used on some soybean and rapeseed, but for all other crops (eg. maize and cotton, which in the US account for >80% of the corn crop; the oilseed rape), Bt has been allowed to lapse or be replaced by other insecticides. Bt crops also account for >20% of the US corn yield (Bergstrom et al, 2005).

The concern over Bt crops has been compounded by the fact that monarch butterfly population declines are also happening in the USA (Gillett et al, in press). Recent studies have revealed that monarch caterpillars ingest the plants containing Bt proteins and die from their ingested material. In fact, since 1996 when pollen from a Bt maize expressing pollen B1 was accidentally introduced into a large population of monarch butterflies, there has been a marked decline in monarch numbers (Gillett et al, 2006). This decline has been blamed on the use of agricultural Bt-expressing maize varieties and the spread of the virus on maize.

The current situation with regard to Bt crops is a serious concern for the sustainability of these insect‐resistant crops, and we believe that in the future, environmental impacts will remain, to varying degrees, despite increased crop yields. The concern about whether Bt is the issue driving this effect, and whether other potential issues related to insecticides are to blame on the emergence of Bt-expressing crops, remains a key issue that we intend to address. It is, however, clear that a clear message has not received the attention and research needed.

In addition to the risk of spreading the virus on Bt maize, these GM crops may have other side‐effects. In 2004, the National Academies of Science noted that a study of a corn hybrid bearing the Bt gene found it to exhibit significant levels of in vitro activity against soil microorganisms, particularly soil-borne nematodes. This was the first study to show that Bt proteins can inhibit microbial activity. Studies have since been carried out, using different Bt maize varieties and the same corn hybrid, and the same findings have been consistently found. It is important to note that resistance to the Bt proteins is not widespread, although a few insects in the USA and Brazil were able to tolerate this herbicide (see Eriksson et al, 2005), which might represent a potential trade off since not all plants produce the herbicide. In fact, we believe that it is more likely that the use of Bt soybean is the cause of the current genetic damage in monarchs, rather than a side effect of the introduction of the GM crops. Moreover, since other insecticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or pyrethroids, are less damaging to plants, their use may have a more positive effect upon Bt resistance.

The fact that Bt proteins are absorbed slowly by mammalian gut microbes and that such effects are reversible is the basis for the possibility that this will result in negative consequences. Indeed, it has been shown that feeding insects genetically modified with the Bt protein from Bt maize is not beneficial to insects (Lutz et al, 2005), and this should be a cause for concern.

In the USA, it has been claimed that Bt is not harmful to people because it is present in small quantities in food and it is not eaten

 billion invested in the Bt business in 2000, more than US$8 billion was spent on Bt seeds alone (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2003). In 2000, Bt production accounted for US$1.15 billion of US$3.2 billion of the total value of commercial-scale Bt cotton in America (Smith, 2002; Ritterfield, 1999). The other main uses of Bt include, to combat the caterpillar of the southern pine bark beetle (Jasperinus pisilio)(SPMB), nematodes of the grain earworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), control of aphids and a variety of fungal diseases. The most common pest of commercial crops is maize; however, corn is used to produce Bt bran flakes (e.g. Bt Bran, Monsanto Co), oil (oil containing Bt protein) (Oleaf, Dow AgroSciences), and other crops can contain such materials.

The global commercial use of Bt has increased from a small niche (i.e. 1.1% of the global corn crop) in 1999 to 10.3% in 2006 (Smith, 2003; World Health Organization, 2000). Despite this global increase in global Bt crop usage, however, worldwide production of cotton has been flat, with 2% being produced in 2002 and 3.3% in 2000 (World Health Organization, 2001). In addition, yields are much lower per unit area for Bt cotton than for conventional cotton. The World Bank (Bhattacharya and Prasad, 2002, p. 4) reports that in 1999 cotton production in India, one of the poorest countries in the world with poor soil, was 924 million tons. In 2002, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), cotton production in India grew at a paltry 1.28 million tons. In a 2003 analysis of global Bt and conventional maize crops, the FAO (Haines and Aulacchi, 2003) reported that Bt corn accounted for only 5.1% of maize production.

The worldwide population of farmers has been expanding by 5.5% per year per capita since 1970. Yet the productivity of Indian farmers under production‐based approaches in 2002 was estimated at only 4.3 tons per hectare (Krishnamurthy, 2003), while cotton farmers in Gujarat (a major Indian producer) averaged 2.4 tons per hectare. Indian government statistics indicate that productivity is declining in developing countries. For many countries, cotton, maize, and oilseed rapeseed, which account for nearly all of the global food supply, are the most important crops (Krishnamurthy, 2003). We question why developing countries are being ignored in the global debate about the monarch phenomenon.

In our review article (e.g. Bhattacharya, 2003; Smith, 2002) and in the paper we are releasing this Spring (Bhattacharya and Prasad, 2002), we found that the evidence available regarding the effects of Bt on monarchs was weak, conflicting, and contradictory. Our main purpose in writing this is to re‐establish the consensus among the scientific community.

The World Health Organization (WHO): In a press release issued in the United States on May 3, 2003, the WHO stated that "Bt has been proven" in a number of animal studies to have significant effects on monarch butterflies (WHO, 2003).

The Department of Agriculture: The USDA, the nation's primary federal agricultural research and education agency, has stated that Bt corn will have a small impact on monarchs (USDA, 2003).

 Candied Bacon Sandwich and my Chicken-Bacon-Lettuce sandwiches from the same cookbook.

Candied Bacon is another one of those amazing bacon recipes that has been passed down from one generation to another. It took me all these years to make my grandmother's recipe, and I have yet to make hers since I have become a mother of five kids. I guess you will need the oven and stove to make good candied bacon, but these recipes are as easy as can be. You have to be patient and practice. The key to perfect candied bacon is good technique. You must be very good with all your baking and candy making skills. I learned as many trickies as I did good recipes.

I highly recommend making a batch of candied bacon on a regular basis to make this recipe work on a big family. You can use this tasty treat on any holiday party because of the fact that you use leftover candies to create delicious dishes and drinks. Here are some of the many ideas I have on how to use candied bacon – or to use it to make other great recipes!

Lucky Charms – I love these candied bacon strips or candied bacon sticks along with the Lucky Charm bars. I made these in a recipe that used candied bacon and it was delicious. You can use cinnamon sugar instead of the candy canes and other candies. You can also use this candied bacon to make all manner of creative and tasty recipes.

Lucky Charms – This is a great idea and a big hit. Lucky Charms and candied bacon are a great combo. And I have a recipe to prove it!

Cheese Board – These Bacon Cheeseburgers would have been the perfect appetizer. I like to make these on a cheeseburger board to serve with a side of fries or sausages. Just a great idea!

Caramelized Onion Candied Bacon – This is another great recipe and uses homemade caramelized onions to make the perfect caramelized onions. I have had a few people tell me they have never seen caramelized onion bacon before. These homemade caramelized onions are great to make at home and have the same wonderful flavors as the candied bacon. A great way to use up leftover candied bacon.

Carrots and Bacon – I have tried the carrot and bacon recipe several times. The first time I made it I thought the taste was too sweet – but it tasted great. I tried it again with the carrots and bacon and I loved the delicious flavor. The difference was very slight. I think the flavor is improved by using the caramelized onions and a sweeter carrot.

Pumpkin Spiced Candied Bacon – This recipe is so easy to make and just adds to an already great recipe that has been making some big splash in the blogosphere. This bacon is also great for a dessert when the candy bar isn't enough. Just be sure you cut out the candied bacon if you are serving this to a dessert party!

Cinnamon Candied Bacon – This is a great simple recipe to try at home. It is also very easy to make this sugar-free recipe. I have had more requests for cinnamon candied bacon than any of my candied bacon recipes. It just so happens that cinnamon is my all time favorite flavor of the candied bacon.

Caramelized Onion Candied Bacon – I like caramelized onions for my bacon. This recipe is based on someone else's recipe. I modified it and added a little more sweetener to help it cut through the rich caramelized onion flavor.

Candied Corn on the Cob – This is a popular treat when I serve Thanksgiving foods. The corn is also a candied bacon

You will be tempted to grab the whole plate and run out the door, laughing all the way. This delicious bacon is also know as Pig Candy and Man Candy. This snack is crispy, sweet, and salty.

Candied Bacon is is the ultimate cocktail party appetizer. Men especially go wild over this sweet and salty treat. Imagine how popular this treat would be at a football party, especial at a Super Bowl party! Another idea – instead of giving candy as a gift for Christmas, how about this candied bacon?

Candied Bacon Recipe from My Baking Addiction:

1-2 cups bacon – I prefer to use bacon that has been cured. For this recipe you could use real bacon too, just beware of salmonella – it is not that uncommon. This is easy process – just follow these steps.

1. Cut the bacon into long strips with a pizza cutter or butter knife. I often cut about 10 slices into 1/2 inch pieces.

2. Cut the slices in half using a large pizza cutter or heavy duty knife.

3. Spread sugar and butter into a baking dish. I use an 8 quart baking dish. You can use pie dishes if you want too, but you need more ingredients for the coating.

4. Place bacon along the bottom of your large baking dish.

5. Roll the bacon into long bacon strips and place them on top of the sugar and butter.

6. Place in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes.

I normally bake my bacon on the upper middle shelf of my oven, but you can bake it on the lower middle section of the oven too.

It is always possible to adjust the cooking time. I keep my oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and my candy on the lower middle shelf, about 5 minutes per baking sheet. If you want to go for the full 40 minutes, go with the lower middle of the oven.

7. Remove from the oven and take the candied bacon out of the pan and place on a large baking sheet.

8. Wrap the bacon around more sugar and butter on the baking sheet and put in your refrigerator overnight to harden the coating for at least 3 hours.

9. Remove bacon from the refrigerator and take out of the pan, roll into long strips and place on a foil lined baking sheet and bake for 1 hour or until crispy.

I use a baking sheet with a little foil over it so my bacon sticks to the sheets.

10. Cut through the bacon with a pizza cutter from top to bottom.

11. It is important to cut through all the fat and the skin before you cut through the bacon. If you do cut through all the fat on the bacon, you will have a hard time removing it with the pizza cutter.

The result is really crispy and soft bacon strips. You will want to eat them like that and not cut the strips like that.

You can remove the candy from the baking sheet and place the candy in a container or dish to get it cool completely.

This is a great party appetizer when we do BBQs. This candy is great on a hamburger or pulled pork. You can also serve as a dip for chips.

When my children have had too much for one night, I make them a giant pot of Candied Bacon. They love it. I serve it on the grill for a nice grill house smoke.<|endoftext|>(UPDATED) There was no sign of any evacuation by 9:55pm, the ABS-CBN News reported

Candied Bacon

Ingredients

1 lb extra-lean ground turkey

3/4 cup bacon grease

2 large eggs, beaten

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

3 tsp. freshly ground black pepper

4 oz. cream cheese, softened

1 1/2 cups mayonnaise

Ingredients for Candied Bacon Dip

2/3 cup heavy cream

1/3 cup candied bacon bits

Directions

Line a 4x8" nonstick skillet with non-stick baking parchment and butter it. When you are ready to cook the bacon, grease the skillet you will be cooking the bacon in or coat it with either bacon grease or non-stick spray. Set the skillet over medium heat. Sauté the bacon until crispy, about 3 minutes. Remove it from the skillet and place it in a shallow baking dish. Pour in enough bacon fat to cover it. Continue to cook the bacon until most of its fat is gone and the pieces are just slightly crisp but not brown or crispy–about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. When ready to make the candied bacon dip, use the back of a large spoon to scrape the crisp bacon from the pan into a small bowl. Add in the sweet and sour, cream, and egg whisking until smooth. Add in salt and ground black pepper. In a small bowl, mix mayo, sugar and salt and set aside. In a large bowl, mix whipped cream and candied bacon. Add the mayo mixture and mix again. You still need to be careful of the bacon grease, or you will end up with too much mayo flavor inside the bacon. Pour the egg mixture over the bacon and mayonnaise layer in the baking dish. Cover with a damp towel or a moist kitchen towel. Refrigerate for 2-3 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). When the bacon is cooled, carefully peel the skin and reserve for another use. When ready to make the Candied Bacon Dip, place the bacon on a baking sheet, and bake for 30 minutes. Let it cool for 10 minutes. Then gently scrape the candied bacon from the pan and place it in a small bowl. Mix the eggs with 1/3 cup of candied bacon. Once in the refrigerator, mix the rest of the candied bacon mixture to the candied bacon. Sprinkle half of your reserved bacon on top of the candied bacon. Sprinkle the rest of it over the eggs and bacon. Serve.

This would've been a perfect setting for a story about a hero (or heroines, if they were going that route) discovering a hidden power, and using that power to end a war with an enemy whose very existence was, at first glance, so far fetched that we just had to wonder.

But while I liked that film enough to see it on a number of occasions, it is something of a let-down, with almost no real story to speak of and a story that ends, just as it began, with a character discovering that,

What Candied Bacon Cocktails Do You Do?<|endoftext|>"I do not know what my future will hold, it's tough, the world is tough," said Ms. Yacoub, a 36-year-old mother of five. "At the moment we don't know where we will go. I'm worried about this situation. I want to take care of my kids so they don't go back to what they used to be – poverty and despair. And I want them to come out of that to a better life. Life for them was very difficult in the past, the house was burned in 2011 and I moved to a poor neighborhood," she added. "Now I don't know what it was like but life is better. I'm sure it will get better," she said.

Ms. Yacoub added that her children do not have a good relationship with their father, who reportedly "is angry and wants to take them back to their poverty," and she added that she "doesn't know what to do with him. I think they would be better off with him dead," she said.

The Yacoub family lives in Al Khader, a poor neighborhood in Baghdad where residents live amid trash and construction debris at the southern end of the city. At the end of 2005 the Iraqi government ordered nearly 2,000 families there to leave or pay a large fine as the government attempted to reclaim its lost territory in the Tigris-Euphrates region. The city was subsequently re-occupied with tens of thousands of Iraqi government troops advancing from the north, east and south after the fall of the Taliban in northern Iraq and as U.S. and British troops reached Baghdad.

In response, government officials moved tens of thousands of families from the impoverished neighborhood to a vast new city called Tikrit, a former U.S. military base that had more or less been abandoned. The new settlement was built on agricultural land with the sole purpose of housing an influx of government personnel who would begin moving into the cities east of Baghdad.

The Yacoubs were relocated to Tikrit in early 2006. Many of the first families to arrive were not members of the Yacoub family. They were originally from Anbar Province and arrived in the city with other displaced families from Fallujah in western Iraq.

The first families settled in central Tikrit with their children while their men worked in the construction industry or joined the security forces. Soon, however, many of

TracFone Edit

TracFone is another MVNO of the América Móvil family (see above) on Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile networks. But you will have to choose one network and can be switchable between AT&T and T-mobile service. Starting in 2015
==================== COMPLETION 450 ====================
 only AT&T are supported:

If the SIM comes with one of the SIM-cards, then the phone can switch between 3G and 4G. The same applies if the SIM in your phone had a pre-loaded or prepaid-plan, for example if the SIM card in your phone had a prepaid-plan. This can be done via the option "Switch between networks". In most cases, you will have a speed of 1 - 10 Kbps. Data is free for the first 10 MB/2.5 gb. After that, it will be 50 cents per MB/1 gb. It may increase a little, depending on the network speed. TracFone has their own data plan available.

Other networks and network speed Edit

T-Mobile and Sprint have slower networks than GSM networks, especially during peak hours, and slower than CDMA (for example GSM networks in Europe can run at up to 9X faster), but are now gaining and have very fast networks. The 4G speed varies between 20M/2 Mbps up to 70M/10 Mbps (depending on the network), depending on the network.

In the USA, TracFone has launched a 4G in all cities on Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, and US Cellular, starting from July 12, 2015, and it should be available everywhere soon, probably in October 2015, though we are not sure if it will be available nationwide. On the international networks TracFone is working well but there is still a lot of work ahead of them, especially for GSM.

Availability Edit

T-Mobile USA plans for prepaid and postpaid phones. These plans may be purchased and cancelled at most of their stores and online:

Data feature packs Edit

These data feature packs can be activated at most stores and online for all postpaid phones for $10/month or for pre-paid phones for $5/mo, but if you change network, the price must be changed at least once during the month.

Extra data Edit

Additional data can be bought for extra 200 MB for $1.20/MB ($1.50 if you have less than 10 GB).

Activation Edit

On most networks these can be activated by calling the number on the SIM card, e.g. "866-819-8191". T-Mobile will often have you change your account number and password to use it on your new phone.

These options can be added to most prepaid phones at home through an online service called 'WebShop.co.uk' but they only work in the UK. They are used to add extra internet to phones as and when they need them. It was started by Virgin Mobile and has spread in the past to some MVNOs, notably Straight Talk.

As of 2016, TracFone now uses its own website with its SIM card registration/activation (see above). Previously all activation of this SIM was done via the América Móvil website, with the registration and activation codes. In order to be on their network while using their own website, you will need a new account. For instructions on how to set up this account, visit the www.tracfone.com/prepaid?lang=en portal. Here you will find a description of the pre-payment option in an easy to understand list. You will have to pay $10 to the seller:

$ 10 USD for shipping of SIM and equipment

$ 15 USD for SIM and equipment activation

$15 USD USD to send the activation link to the new SIM's owner.

The pre-payment process is pretty simple: send the package to the seller in the country where they send the SIM (if it's outside the US, you will have to check the regulations about how many SIM cards to send each month) and have your buyer send the payment information by paypal or credit card.

The SIM card is activated if the payment is received. If you need to activate more than once, please call TracFone support and ask for assistance at 866-901-2359.

They offer a very nice service: the SIM card will be transferred to the new owner automatically. They support prepaid cards and have good service in the first days and days and a lot of customer support.

Neither large loads that are concentrated in relatively smaller areas, nor loads that are at or near the edge of a large opening in the ice, are safely described by the equation, graph, or table.In such cases, seek more advice.

The equation, graph and table assume clear, sound ice. If white, bubble-filled ice makes up part or all of the ice thickness, count it as only half as much clear ice.

Any recent large snowstorm creates a new load on the ice. If the new snow is heavy enough, the ice sheet will sag and its top surface will be submerged below the water level. Then water will flood the top of the ice sheet through cracks, saturating the lower layers of the snow. Until this slush is completely frozen, stay offthe ice sheet. When the saturated snow becomes frozen, it is an added thickness of white ice.

Contrary to what you would expect, a rapid, large air temperature drop makes an ice sheet brittle, and the ice may not be safe to use for 24 hours or more.

If the air temperature has
==================== COMPLETION 453 ====================
 been falling steadily for some time, the ice is already frozen. When it is suddenly thawed, the ice will immediately fall back into its old position and become dangerous.

If a deep, sudden temperature drop is occurring, a rapid descent of temperatures into the ice below causes many ice surfaces to freeze solid on the surface, causing instability, and ice failure. This occurs more rapidly when temperatures drop quickly. When the ice surface is frozen under the surface, it becomes a massive structure in itself that cannot be stabilized by other ice layers. If a slope of less than about 7% is encountered, all remaining ice on the slope will be frozen over without a rapid temperature rise above this value.

When snow and ice have reached their minimum density and size, they are not safe to use for long periods.

This month, we are starting out with a simple exercise to help everyone improve their social interactions and relationships:

1. Take a photo of yourself smiling and sending it to ten random people who make you feel uncomfortable.

Let's face it, when it comes to the internet, the internet doesn't have your best interests at heart.

On the internet, everybody is going to be looking for someone to blame:

But the truth is, most of the people who leave these comments aren't really thinking too far ahead to why their victim might be feeling uncomfortable and what actions you might be able to take to stop it.

And when you're posting your self-shot photo to other people, you're not just hurting yourself, you're hurting them too.

2. Then tell them who you are and exactly why you made this photo.

Asking for other people's names and how to reach them is the most passive aggressive way to get them to take action, and they know it!

If they really want to send you the photo, they don't want to see a bunch of anonymous strangers.

So try to make the post clear in your text just why you're feeling uncomfortable and why you need to send photos to show them what it's like being with you.

In your text, describe the situation in more detail and why you're taking it.

A simple way to do this is to write:

"Today I felt uncomfortable and need to send you something to help you understand what you're going through because I don't want you to do the same thing next time I see you."

3. Respond to the people who send photos and then comment (or message back) and/or send the photo back to them.

Ask them why the person is so defensive and if they would like you to explain your situation more to help them understand.

Tell them it's very respectful to ask for the name of the people that send photographs or message back to you.

If they say no, give them your email address so they can ask you if you want to do it again to make sure the person sends you the photograph and message back.

4. Once you get their email, respond in the same way to the sender of the photo/message back with an explanation of your concern and the situation you are experiencing.

This is a great way to ensure that whatever email or message they are sending you is relevant for you and what you are experiencing.

If it's not really relevant, don't respond to it. It might not even be from the person or your name might be totally wrong.

But just because there is no response from the person doesn't

Contrary to what you would expect, a rapid, large air temperature drop makes an ice sheet brittle, and the ice may not be safe to use for 24 hours or more.

If the air temperature has
==================== COMPLETION 454 ====================
 been rising for at least a few days and the new snow is light and fluffy, snow drifts in a continuous, straight line toward the center of the ice sheet. The density and size of such drifting snow make it less stable and more likely to collapse under your weight.

Snowfall and ice concentration on a snow-free glacier are not the same thing. On the northernmost of such glaciers, large amounts of snow cover the top surface with an ice concentration that is equal to that on a glacier that has a high degree of snowfall. The snow will tend to accumulate on the surface as new meltwater freezes and drains out the glaciers valleys. The volume may not be as great as after a good snowfall, but the snow volume (and volume density) is larger. It will be a different type of snow, but not as stable as after snowfall.

The ice sheet may be quite thin, or it may have many glaciers with a common land surface. The thickness and density differences will affect the loads, density profiles associated with them, conditions of melting and freezing, and the way that the ice sheet responds to climate change.

As snow, rain and meltwater recede out of a glacier, they mix with the air, leaving behind a layer of ice just below the water's surface. This layer of ice is called the glacial ice cover and is made up of ice sheets, lake beds, and small glaciers. Water gets underneath the ice as it melts, and it freezes. Over time, if the ice sheet is warm enough, water expands as it freezes, creating a thick layer under the ice. Then, when it thaws, the water is still beneath the ice sheet. The ice surface is then exposed.

As the weight of melting snow adds to the weight of all the ice above, the ice begins to shrink and shrink in a pattern that allows moisture and water vapor to escape and cool the surface, turning it into snow. The shrinking and thawing process gradually heats the ice sheet and releases water through the pores in its surface, melting the ice above it. As the water evaporates, it turns into vapor and is condensed again to form ice crystals.

The volume of ice melted during this process will be relatively higher than that when the glacier is as thick as the table above. At lower elevations, as temperatures and humidity become milder, much of the ice will be exposed and melting will be more rapid, and the volume of ice will shrink quickly. In the higher elevations, melting can be more rapid as ice crystals form all over the surface. At higher elevations, though, the weight of the growing ice will eventually take away ice from below the thinning ice, so that the thinner and thinner ice will begin to melt and recede.

Even in a glacier as thick as the table above, snow can still accumulate. Since so much of the surface area of the ice sheet is exposed, snow may accumulate in the interior of the glacier. Snow is heavier than water and more prone to be carried down into the valleys where it can melt and form ice. As the ice recedes from the surface, more and more snow falls. As the surface becomes covered with snow, its volume becomes reduced, causing the melting to accelerate. Over the long term, snow will cover much of the surface. Even once the snow is over 70% melted, it retains a little water, so the snow still melts as the pressure drops due to melting.<|endoftext|>Sorcery

If the air temperature has
==================== COMPLETION 455 ====================
 dropped below freezing for more than 5 hours in a 24-hour period, the ice could collapse, and many times it does.

Dry snowfall can damage or crack ice, and can melt the underlying liquid water, which makes safe use more challenging. If the snowfall is very heavy (50 or more inches in 24 hours), it may completely melt the ice.

The weight of a snow pile often creates an upward force on the ice layer that can cause damage if it's not properly supported. Larger objects and snowstorms are generally the most dangerous to use.

Loud, high-pitched noises, such as the roar of a jet engine, or the sound of machinery that breaks or moves by its own weight are sources of great danger to people and property on the ice sheet. These sounds are often masked by the ice's smooth appearance, but you can still be injured, or worse.

The ice is often covered with snow or another substance that can help keep cold air out, but it is impossible to completely seal any area that is exposed to the snow below. If the exposed area gets wet, cold air rushes in from below.

Because it is so thin, the ice may melt, or break apart, when exposed to the wind. In this case it is important to protect it from blowing snow, ice or wind. Do not be alarmed if a chunk of ice breaks off from a piece of ice sheet, because the break will not cause damage.

How much ice does the average skier need?

For information about the average individual skier's ice needs, ask your coach or the ski patrol crew.

It's also important to know that some people need more ice, some need less, and some need enough that it is dangerous to go through them.

A person's experience, motivation, and weight may play a big role in determining their specific needs. A beginner skier who wants a safe and enjoyable winter experience may need a lot of extra ice than an advanced skier who may be doing a few longer distances in a year and wants to get in a training block or a couple of big training runs.

The more experienced a skier becomes, the fewer days they snowboard or run or ski in a year, so it is important to get them the amount of snow they need for the amount of snowboard and/or skiing they do. Even an experienced skier can benefit from a good bit of snow, and there are many places on the mountain where it is possible to get a reasonable amount with a little effort.

If all goes as expected, the more snow a skier gets to know, the more they need. One person's safe, fun winter is another person's risky, scary winter.

According to the 2012 survey by the British Dietetic Association (BDA), 44% of parents in the UK are vegetarians or vegan. This represents an increase of five percentage points over the previous year, and a rise of two percentage points since 2001, when the BDA discovered that 30% of parents were vegetarians/vegans.

The survey revealed that the majority (56%) of vegetarian parents consider their family to be healthy and vegetarian or vegan are among the most commonly advised, followed closely by vegetarian advice to eat fish and chips (42%).

The survey asked parents about their children's dietary habits, and found that:

Contrary to what you would expect, a rapid, large air temperature drop makes an ice sheet brittle, and the ice may not be safe to use for 24 hours or more.

If the air temperature has
==================== COMPLETION 456 ====================
 dropped fast enough, ice may begin to thaw and crumble on its surface. This is a very bad thing. This does not mean the ice has broken in two, or even has disappeared. The ice is still solid, but its strength and structure has been markedly impaired. You can safely return if the ice is still safe.

Snowfall on hills or ridges can affect the area of the melting ice. This is particularly the case for the southern portion of this ice sheet.

The melting rate may vary at different elevations, depending on the snowfall, the temperature, and topography. The ice will melt about 2½ times faster at higher elevations.

Snow falling on the ice sheet's surface will affect its melting rates only if the surface is wet, and if the ice is frozen. Snow-caused melting makes the ice thicker, harder and less elastic. Snow-caused melt may be sufficient to cause the ice to become unacceptably unsafe for use.

Layers

It will be helpful to view an ice sheet in the various layers it will appear in.

Ice is a mixture of two things: solid ice and liquid water. It is the frozen portions of a glacier that are solid.

Snow is composed of tiny particles of snow and ice in small flakes. Snow also contains dissolved minerals such as silica, which make it softer and more flexible.

A thin layer of frozen water is between the snow and the ice. If a piece of snow fell on hard ground, the ice would melt in a short time from it. A thin layer of frozen water covers the snow and forms the surface area covered by the ice.

The ice sheet has a thin film of liquid water covering the entire surface. This liquid water is frozen water that has collected near the ground.

Above a certain weight, the layer of liquid water does not flow into a larger hole and the ice sheet collapses when it freezes.

If the liquid water is still below the ice, it will flow when the ice begins to melt so it covers more of the ice sheet surface at lower elevations in areas where the snow is more recent.

When the liquid water reaches the level of the upper ice sheet, the layers above it begin to solidify, and the layers below begin to melt, depositing water over the top surface of the ice.

The layers underneath the liquid water are the ice sheet's structure; the top ice sheets are more like an up-to-date car. The layer of ice above the liquid water is called the surface ice. The ice below the surface ice is called the snow.<|endoftext|>The UESPWiki – Your source for The Elder Scrolls since 1995

"I just feel guilty – I just want him to be here."

She appealed for Victorians to keep their eyes open for Donald, nicknamed "Donny", who disappeared from an Echuca campsite on Saturday night.

"We love him and miss him and if he hears this please come home, please be safe," she said.

The search spread to Bendigo after an Echuca resident said she served a teenage boy breakfast on Sunday.

The woman has told police that a youth, matching Donald's description, spoke to her at around 10.30am. He said he had spent the night in the bush and that he was intending to travel to Bendigo.

Another of Donald's sisters, Rachael O'Keane, said the teen's cousin had travelled up to Bendigo today to continue the search.

"We've been to train stations, truck stops, servos, bus stops, milk bars, we've even been to pubs, just in case any truckies have seen him," she said.

Ms O'Keane said Donald was a keen hiker and wanted to visit the Kangaroo Valley in August, or visit the Sunshine Coast. He is known to drive a red 2006 Holden Commodore with NSW registration RY15.

She said a woman saw him hitchhiking on the Kurnell to Bendigo freeways on Saturday night, and someone gave him money. She said he had recently become interested in the motorcycle stunt community.

Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton described how at 2.15am Victorians should contact their local police if they noticed Donald walking the streets, with red eyes, or had any information.<|endoftext|>This is a beautiful light pink blush for the eyes, and it's also lovely for blush on the cheeks.

I think it was just a waste of everyone's time.<|endoftext|>I have always admired the work and talents of Charles Krauthammer of the Washington Post. He has been a great contributor to the media for a very long period of time.

His column, "Krugman on the Money," has always been a great intellectual and moral source for me, for I always find myself turning to him for moral guidance, and for some sense of what the real world is really like.

The issue of the day is the possibility of "debt redemption." This is a phenomenon that arises out of a deep and painful divide in the US population, in which debtors are treated as criminals and parasites, while creditors are cast as angels and victims.

Krugman believes that it is the creditors, rather than the debtors themselves, who created this great problem. He has written many times in his column, in the New Yorker, and elsewhere, about an international debt "system" that is entirely corrupt, a "debt-serfs' society."

His columns have become immensely popular on right-wing websites. One might even say, his ideas are a global intellectual movement, an idea or philosophy that he spreads as widely beyond his own country as possible.

It is true that much of his criticism revolves around debt and debt restructuring, rather than outright bankruptcies. His criticism focuses on the very nature of financial markets, and their ability to create problems that never actually occur, because there is never a "finite" time in which to resolve the problem.

He notes that the debt, of which he thinks that there are currently $20 trillion in outstanding in the world, has no real economic objective; rather, the debt is simply designed to serve a political purpose in the interests of the creditors. These creditors are in the business of making money out of debt payments.

If, however, we borrow money in order to engage in something that produces real wealth, then the government makes a new investment in the debt – a new, productive investment. In this case, the public takes up ownership of the productive asset, and makes the debt payment, in return for a social benefit – greater economic efficiency.

The argument in favor of debt restructuring is simple: in the present situation, when a government spends a large portion of its tax revenues on new investment projects, the new debt will be paying down the old debt with greater

Victorian Emergency Health Services will conduct an incident assessment and will provide support to the family.

Rachael O' Keane said she hoped Victorians would "know that we love him, we miss him and we will do anything we can to find his safe return".

"He is loved by all of us – we just want him home," she said. "We believe he went as a young kid on a bike and he'd just come to visit his Auntie. He didn't tell anybody he was going."

Victorians have also been urged to follow police updates on the search on Facebook.

The teenager's grandfather, Bill Deane, appealed for Victorians to keep their eyes peeled for his grandson.

"There's about 70 police officers out here looking for him and I'd just like them to know people are thinking about him," Mr Deane said.

TUESDAY, 10:44PM EST

THE HAGUE — ISIS supporters in the Netherlands have reportedly posted that the terrorist attacks in Brussels this week were an "accident" with police having prevented it. A Dutch-run Twitter account under the name of a "Jolly Martyr", named Hijabi of Damascus, posted a tweet which read:

"As Allah says, the explosion in Brussels is an accident, police have prevented the attack".

The authenticity of the post, which appeared earlier today, had not been verified.

TUESDAY, 10:35PM EST

ATLANTA — U.S. President Barack Obama warned U.S. citizens to "be very vigilant" following a series of terrorist attacks in Paris — and said there was no evidence that the strikes were "inspired by international terrorism".

Obama said the violence in the French capital would not "change our posture or our willingness to take the fight to them".

In Washington, FBI Director James Comey said they found no clear ties between the Islamic State terror group and Wednesday's attacks — despite a man they identified as a Belgium citizen who traveled to Syria has been arrested and charged with helping to plan an attack.

However, Comey stressed it appeared that the attack had been carefully planned with "specific knowledge" of the location.

At least 30 died and 130 were injured when explosions ripped through the Brussels' airport and in an underground train network Wednesday evening.

The attacks are being described as terrorist incidents, as they do not fit traditional definitions of such matters, such as a hostage taking.

The Islamic State terrorists have claimed responsibility.

In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron offered his condolences as authorities began a manhunt for two brothers suspected of carrying out the Brussels attacks.

He tweeted:

Our thoughts and prayers are for all the victims/families & the people of Brussels tonight. My thoughts are very much w/ your loved ones. — David Cameron (@David_Cameron) March 22, 2015

The Belgian capital is in the heart of Europe and has traditionally been a target of terrorists.

There are concerns this will inspire other people in Europe to launch attacks against targets such as public buildings.<|endoftext|>A man who was stabbed during a dispute was killed while trying to escape through a parking garage at

Donald was "very well known to everyone in that part of the area" and had lived in the area for two to three years, his sister said.


"It's been a long struggle," she said.

"We'll do the best we can, but we cannot go back. We don't have any choice. The best we can do is keep looking. We're just trying to help."

Victoria Police say that there is been no major breakthrough and that there is no reason to think any one has been in contact with Donald or anyone close to him.

Anyone who may have seen Donny in the Bendigo area over the holiday weekend is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

Google on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street expectations as the company continues the fight for a bigger share of the Internet-connected home business.

The company reported a loss of $2.4 billion, or 28 cents a share, on revenue of $20.5 billion.

Analysts had on average been expecting a profit of 30 cents/share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette said Google expects "substantial" revenue growth for the remainder of the year.

For the current quarter, Google is estimating that it will generate $6.8 billion in revenue, which includes a $3 billion charge related to the recall of the company's Android phone operating system, according to the company.

Analysts had expected the company to report adjusted sales or revenue of $21 billion. Those expectations included $2.3 billion in revenues from the second quarter of 2016 and a $250 million charge for the recall of devices.

Revenue from the unit with the highest sales volume — Google Home — was estimated at $2.

 to look through their garbage, which would give them an idea whether there was anything "spotted" that might help find Donald.

Echuca police said a man had been arrested in Bendigo but declined to give details about his identity.

The family's appeal to find the former schoolboy was the latest in a string of such calls.

Last week, the head of Echuca school, the United Christian Girls' Christian Association, asked Victorians to "come forward, get hold of us".

Echuca police also handed out fliers last week with information about Donald and asked people to check on their properties.

Meanwhile, some of Donald's relatives are set to fly to Bendigo for a private search of the bushland between the townsite and the community where he disappeared.

Friends of Donald, who lived in Bendigo, believe he may have gone north to meet and befriend a group of youths.

The 21-year-old was last seen driving the wrong way down a one-way street on Sunday after staying overnight in the bushes, police said. His car later was found abandoned in Bendigo.

The pair have been identified as "John" the 20-year-old from Bendigo and "Michael" the 17-year-old from Croydon.

Echuca police commander Inspector John Young said their car was found with an orange peel still attached to the top but nothing else missing.

Police are urging people to check on their properties as the duo could have made the return trip up to Victoria "as a last-minute sight for people who need to pick up some belongings".

"It is unusual for people to go up here to look for them," he said.

"But they could be doing it for any number of reasons."

media_camera Echuca Police are looking for the missing young men.

Echuca police said "a few" people had contacted them today but it had not been confirmed whether any of them had met John or Michael.

Young said many people came up today in search of "any information that we may hold and some people may feel they've made a mistake in going to us".

"We will look at each claim individually," he said.

Inspector Young also urged Victorians to check their rubbish when their bins were collected to be on the lookout.

"If people feel they've seen anything suspicious that they haven't picked up themselves or that can be helped with our investigation they just need to keep their eyes open," he said.

He said people should carry out house to house checks in their own suburbs and in rural areas.

"I'd also ask people to keep checking the bushland from time to time," Inspector Young said.<|endoftext|>Image caption A woman who attended the event told the BBC she was "very sad" to hear of the shooting

A gunman has shot dead five people at a US college in Roseburg, Oregon.

The suspect is believed to have been shot and killed by police after he opened fire inside the community college in the city of 1,300 residents.

The attack took place at about 11:50am local time (07:50 BST) on Thursday, according to the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

The FBI said at least 10 weapons were found at the scene and that the gunman may have made bombs.

You can take a look at these test-images to understand some of the output formats.You have to specify a number between 0 and 8, and optionally the name of a log file to which this output will be written.There can be many log files (outputs to which this output will be written) in the directory of the process. If a log file does not exists,it will be created.If the process is not in the foreground,the process does not wait for logging to end but waits for it to be closed when it wants to write output. In this case the output files will be written at the end of the process instead of at start.You can pass parameters to the HandBrakeCLI program on the command line. This output depends on your environment,see here for details on running HandBrakeCLI.<|endoftext|>How did you do on the Challenge?

They're great with the basic commands (walk, sit, stand, eat, drink, play, etc.) but their intelligence can get in the way when the time calls for it. When given the opportunity to play mind games with a cat that loves to trick things with an object, you're usually going to do things like put a treat in his paw. But is the fact that cats love toys and they want them right beside them a sign that they like their owners. What if they knew you had a hidden treasure to reveal to them, just for a challenge?

A cat named Lina loves toys. While the majority of the time she'll just sit with her ball on the floor or in the air, sometimes she'll get a little excited over the toy that she finds. If she's lucky, Lina will get the toy (if there is ever such a thing). Then she will go after it while her human is out of sight. This is a perfect opportunity to lure a cat to your door with a treat. You can try hiding the treat somewhere else in the room, even if it's in a different room, and then call him up to your door. As long as he remains interested in his new toy, he should be more than willing to come back and play.

 18 years old. So it's not really serious study. (…) That's why I often say in interviews that I have no education art. But as with everyone, it's a bit false to say this. Because there's thousands of tutorials available on the Internet.

Even if I studied them alone, I had a lot of books, I had plenty of resources. I can't say I learned all by myself. I don't live in a cave, and I didn't find half of the tips and tricks I use alone.

You did some street art early on as well, right?

Yes, yes. I started as a portrait artist in Avignon. It's a city with a lot of tourism in summer. And on the main place of the city, there already were portraitists. So I took time to watch what they were doing.

And because I was very young and they were not really afraid I was taking some money from them, they let me start next to them and I learned a lot of things next to them this way.

How old were you at that time?

19 years old.

I think you shared some pictures with me from that time, right?

Yes,
==================== COMPLETION 469 ====================
 yes. And then I started to think, "I've made this city look bad. It looks like a very typical post-apocalyptic city. It's the kind of city the TV shows were made in."

That first painting is about a woman who is in the front, she's holding a lot of money in front. The background was in my mind from the time I was watching a TV show.

And because I was always taking money from people, I was very careful. When I painted this woman, I put my camera right above her and the background was like the camera.

So my job was to take the money – the camera – and the background up there because I know if I take the money or the background over the portrait, you will be a lot more happy. It's not the case when the camera is on the portrait. (…) And it's good to show how much money and how many people have taken pictures over you, you don't want to see a painting of a couple with the money and in the background, it's always a terrible situation. And it's really scary for artists!

What was your best work from that period?

Well, this is one of my best work, I think.

She looks sad. And it's not just sadness, it's the tension in the work as well.

But I can say this, because I don't have anything behind her. She's not in the portrait, I can't hide it. But there was a reason for me to do that painting. I painted this woman on the wall and I wrote, on a small piece of paper: I hate my job.

Then I added this picture: you can go to hell.

To show this woman that she's not free anymore. (…)

This picture – it was a really good job, I'll add.

And this is a work from my last period. This woman is very beautiful. Very strong woman, standing in front of her house. And she's saying things that mean nothing. Maybe it's true, but it's not the kind of statement you can make because it's so clear what you are saying.

The way she is speaking about her daughter and saying she can't understand why the child has disappeared. These words mean nothing.

But I can say that she is sad and it's the reason behind that picture.

So that's one of my best pictures.

What kind of paintings did you paint then?

I painted pictures of children. I don't know, I can't really show these paintings in public. But I showed them to many friends and colleagues, the most common ones – they were kids and I liked them as well.

But I wanted to show you that my work is made with a lot of experience.

These images are from my art book.

I've been asked in the past, "why did you draw?" But I can't answer this question for sure. I can't paint anymore, so I can't answer that question. It really is a mystery.

And if you look at my paintings, you can see that I'm happy with what I'm doing. I feel like I'm painting the same pictures as the one I saw the first time when I saw my childhood, or this woman.

These are pictures and they are not about the money in the background, they're about a man and a woman who really are sad and there's a reason for it.

You can see the real emotion behind them.

In the other videos there were also children's drawings. Some were quite difficult.

They were really hard, sometimes

 some of them. Not all, but most of them. For example, one of my works was about the "Hands of Love", a famous French portraitist painted in 1905. And the picture I did and which they sold was on a wall, not close to them, but just behind them by a wall. I had the right angle.

And I put it behind a wall. But no one noticed and the wall was there for centuries. And the man in the picture, the one wearing a red shirt, still lives there. The painting that he did in 1905, the "Hands of Love", is on a museum wall near the entrance of this museum.

And what was the story behind this painting?

That's a very deep story. In 1877 he was a famous portraitist in Paris. He painted very beautiful portraits and he was the most famous portraitist in Paris, then, until the revolution and the war. People saw his paintings and they started buying all the paintings he painted on the street. When the revolution happened, he escaped from Paris. He went to Paris, stayed for a few years here and there, and became a painter.

But when the revolution passed, he came again to Paris. And his father died. He was alone again and he painted one last portrait. And he started again. And he painted the last portrait he ever painted. The painting was on a wall. It was on the wall of a woman who was dying in her life. He had painted her long before the revolution and in a different way. That is how he got the idea to paint on the wall the last portrait he ever painted.

He painted the picture and put it on the wall, and at that time it was in the middle of a street in Paris. In front of the restaurant where the woman had died. People walked over this portrait and people looked at it very closely. They looked so closely and they couldn't leave it alone. And people started to say "that is his last picture!"

So they wanted this painting back at the same place where he painted it, at the original location. Even if they were dead?

In those days, people didn't die, there was still life in Paris. And the man was in great danger. So he put him, his son and his sister on board of a ship to America. And the rest of his family came from a different part of France and a different country. That's how the family escaped from Paris in 1871. And that's how they came to live in New York.

So you were not alone?

No, I didn't have no friends like I do now. In those days, I didn't have any friends. I used to go and look for portraits or drawings or anything, just to find out that people were painting on the walls.

And you never got really close to any of them?

Only once for a night, it was at the Parisian gallery. And I talked with the guy that works there. He was very good for me. And this man told me that he painted some other famous portraitist in Paris. He told me that this man wrote in a book, he told me his name in the book. He told me that his name in the book is very great and his portraits are a great pleasure to view.

That was the first time I met with a famous portraitist. And so I went again one month later. And one of the things this man told me that he doesn't know that the painting that he painted is still alive. So I asked him to let me take some photos. And I asked the photographer to take some photos of the portrait and also to help me

==================== COMPLETION 471 ====================
 I also did some photographs from there.

And then what happened? What did your life change for you?

My studio opened in the end of the same year. It was a studio in a studio. That was a big problem for me. I could not work there with a real studio. So instead, I built one with a wooden floor and everything inside of that, all my furniture. I had everything in this wooden room – a chair, some tables, I even had a TV (…) I started teaching sketching at an art school nearby.

And this is the beginning of my painting career.

And here I am now. I work in an art school today.

Do you think it can be the same or similar?

Maybe I'll get the chance at another studio. I started as a portrait artist and then I got a studio and was allowed to teach painting. Now I'm starting again, the same. I have my sketchbook and paint the sketches that I have made here.

Are you painting your own artwork instead?

Of course, I do. It's my art, that's how I make it. I did this for over 20 years when I was alone, I painted portraits, landscapes, and other things. So I know it's my work.

You are also part of the group of artists from Pays de la Loire, a tiny region of the Loire Valley. How does it feel, to be one of the few artists that came from this region, to be famous in Paris?

Yes I'm very proud of that. And it feels really great: Paris, the gallery, my book. I also get many letters from people from all over the world asking when I'm going to finish this book, asking how many more pictures there are.

I'm going to publish a series of paintings that are like sketches on a piece of paper (…) They only show at the gallery. The final painting looks like a movie or a piece of painting. It's very simple but the way it was made is very sophisticated. The whole book will be published in March.

I think that is really a wonderful way to make them. And I did those drawings as if I was showing paintings, and then it looks like it was painted on a piece of paper. I think it's really good that it will be published in March.

What inspired you to do this book?

I'm working on my master thesis at the moment, and my thesis is about portraits, and that's what inspired me. Then, I started working on these paintings as a master. I wanted to show a painting so it must go in this line.

What makes you believe you can really teach this kind of art, so that you can teach it to the young people – that you can give it to them? There are few artists from the countryside that are trying to do this in the world, from the Loire valley so I try to say that I have tried it with them. And they say this to me: 'Thank you! Thank you for helping me with my studies'

You didn't just stop there though. What is your goal with the book?

The main goal of the book is for the young people in the Loire valley to have a reference on how to find a studio because there are still a lot of uninteresting small rooms for the young children. A big studio, which is like a school is the answer. They see that a big studio is nice and it really makes them feel better and they want to go to a big studio.

Is this just a reaction – the people from the Loire valley want to make sure the book has

 but only a few of them. I wasn't very good at the technique back then. But I tried to share everything I did with the portrait artists around me.

And then a few years later, when I started selling the pictures, I also made some street art pictures. But I didn't have any professional artists behind me to make the pictures look so professional. It was not a great experience to be so far up and struggling with the technical side of the work.

At this time my dad had a small gallery and I decided to use that for my own work. So the gallery was used for the artwork and my drawings.

So I think about a short time, I created the whole portfolio of my own.

That was a really good idea. I'm surprised how well it's worked out.

Well you know some people will say the same thing about any artist. That's just the way they see it. But I really think that if you study well, if you think carefully, whatever direction you go, if you are lucky it will be successful. I used a lot of resources, books, magazines, and online forums and so on to come up with new ideas for painting. But there is nothing I could have done without my dad.

You were doing sketches for me right at the beginning, right?

Yes, yeah.

I was trying to figure out what they were for. And I think I was still doing sketches from early 2000. But there were some other sketches, I'm not sure when they were, that I can't find right now. Probably a while ago.

That's weird. Maybe they didn't come about in the past 5 years?

No, it just seemed to come to me recently and the sketches became the main focus. I don't remember who the artist was, but the drawings were always there. I was just working with the drawings and never knew which direction I should go.

So you started with drawings? So this was your first time as a full-time artist?

Yes, yes.

It was a very good idea I'd like to see more of them. That you're still painting, even if only for fun. That has been a surprise.

Well, it was my first time.

What was your first impression? Is the artwork still the same today?

In many ways it is still the same. I still paint, I know I should have a studio and make more pictures. But I still enjoy my work, it's still fun. There are still things I like painting.

What's next for you? Are you trying to improve at any of the areas you've spoken about yet? Or are you just going to let your art, and your drawings go?

The art is the greatest part of the game. I've been doing artwork for almost 20 years of my whole life. I don't know when I'm done, and I don't know when I can stop. So I'm very thankful for the art. In my eyes it is a gift of nature. It's like a gift in my life, a gift from God. And I love it. And I hope to be doing my work, all I like to do, for a long long time, in this way. That's not to say I will continue to do it that way forever, of course not. But I never stop.

But when I said I wouldn't stop, that came as a surprise, I guess. I'm a very stubborn person. But I try to think what the next step should be. And that's the best thing I do.

 of development that produce us. 1 Introduction In the first part of my chapter, Evolution and Human Nature (Praeger, 1983), I presented a number of evidence-based predictions based on evolutionary theory about the nature of our individual nature. Based on our empirical evidence, which I discussed in considerable detail, I outlined several broad classifications of human nature: 1) Aversive Nature, 2) Adaptive, 3) Prosocial, 4) Unlearned, 5) Proactive, and 6) Generational. As I have demonstrated in the subsequent chapters, the human mind was not always so hardwired into a "permissive" and reactive attitude. Rather, human nature has been shaped since the beginning of sapiens at least by a strong tendency to be unlearned, pro-socially and adaptively unregenerate in ways we may never understand. 1 Introduction Some of these pro-socially and pro-socially unlearnt behaviors may be present in the animal kingdom as in- vulgent. Yet, others, perhaps, are more subtle, and probably represent the results of the cumulative influence of thousands of years of human cultural experience. Although the biological aspects of human development are not directly applicable to an individual human, our experience in the prison setting and in the natural world should allow us to appreciate the fact that the human mind is inherently and continually open to changes in its behavior and emotional state. It is also important to note that most of what we experience in life is not just biological. Our cognitive perceptions of the world and of ourselves are also partly biological. Thus our perceptions become enriched and influenced by many biological and even psychological processes. To assume that it is only our biology that is fundamentally and permanently fixed, a proposition which has been common for many years in the field of biog- raphy, is inaccurate. It is more appropriate to say that the human mind is open- endingly malleable. Indeed, the fact that our innate dispositions and tendencies to be helpful, cooperative and helpful- ness may differ so greatly from one person to another should call into question the ability of the psychological sciences to speak generically of a shared human nature. However, there is also some evidence that our predispositions and tendencies to be unhelpful, uncooperative, and unprosocial have historically been shaped and modified significantly by cultural conditions and by individuals' lives. 1 Introduction Our "unlearned pro-situ- ative" tendencies can be summarized into four subtypes: 1) Those which, in a society that stresses certain kinds of behavior, become more pronounced and perhaps more prevalent. 2) Those which in a society that stresses certain kinds of behavior become less prominent. 3) Those which become most prominent relative to the general population and 4) those which decline in status and/or become more frequent and/or more severe. These are our four "unlearned pro-socialities," as described by the authors of the great American sociologist James A. Coleman in his book "Human Nature and Social Reality" (pp. 5-8. Coleman's work was based on extensive historical research from the last two centuries. Although the term appears in his title, however, Coleman's work is in fact much broader, and covers the broader and far more important range of pro-social tendencies of human beings than would appear in the title of this short book. This chapter will provide a good introduction to the research and analysis of these four unlearnt pro-socialities. The following chapter will describe in more detail the processes that make them so difficult to unlearn. Chapter Four Human nature and social reality In the final analysis, we can define a pro-social nature as one which, while it may be difficult to be both social and friendly,

 of social learning in all such situations. Indeed, for the most part we can control what we are able to control. This is not to say that the power of perversion may be contained or limited to the extreme situations where the victim is under constant duress from others, or where the abuse has begun and is continuing. As we saw in the Stanford experiment, it is also possible for abuse to continue and intensify over time. I refer simply to the social nature of human beings and to a tendency of individuals to become more and more perverted as a result of the influence of their milieu and history on their attitudes, thoughts, and behavior in the social environment. It is this very tendency that explains why a person's perversions change over time and why an individual's psychology can become more warped over time. In other words, perverted thinking is, at least in part, a function of one's environment, and especially in the context of a society in which personal freedoms and individual rights have been subverted and compromised. In light of all of this, should not we be more vigilant in our attempt to safeguard the most basic rights given to all of us by our law and Constitution? We certainly should not let our fellow citizens and those we love — in all the varying degrees of darkness that is humanity — be tortured by the perverted, perverted minds and wills of others in the name of some misguided, politically correct "just war" doctrine. For the sake of our society and our civilization, we must not allow our fellow man and woman to be subjected to a new way of thinking at the expense of our own individual freedoms and liberties. In summary, this paper contends that human psychology is perverted; what this means is that the nature — the basic, natural, inborn nature — of man is malleable and at the mercy of social, cultural and institutional circumstances. The nature of man as free and independent individual is not something that can, by its nature, be controlled. Nor, conversely, is the nature of man to bend or change his nature; there can be no such thing. As Charles Murray has noted, "There is no biological, scientific or cultural basis for thinking that human nature is something set in stone, immutable and immutable. 'Nature' is an illusion . . . 'nature' is a fraud." This reality is precisely why free, human-oriented societies are necessary to protect and preserve the basic constitutional rights of all of our fellow citizens. We must not forget that to protect these rights we must defend the individual as free and responsible person with a full conscience, a free will, a choice to do good or to do evil. We must not forget that freedom and liberty are not a gift given to any one individual or group of individuals, nor do they lie in some distant social future, "once upon a time." Instead, they come to all of us as an inalienable right of all American citizens, no matter what color or creed we happen to belong to. To take away these rights is to take away the very spirit of America and the fundamental principle of freedom, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. For this same reason, we must seek to educate our citizens to the reality of the perverted nature of human beings, in both their individual and social natures, and to the need for a free society. For in our society, with free institutions, the natural human desire for freedom is more powerful than our desire for "security," wealth, power and "security." We have an obligation to help our fellow man realize his full potential — in both the individual and the social sense — in order to safeguard freedom. This is the very reason for the freedoms we cherish and why they are vital to all of us, no matter whether we happen to be African or Asian,

 of thought that occur within or surround the "total situation." This is one of the fundamental conundrums of human psychology. There can be no doubt that one's mind is not merely an isolated and self-contained mechanism but is a reflection of one's total environment for the mind to function in. The process of thought that unfolds within the "total situation" is governed by the same principles of nature as the laws of physics. It is based on the very same principles of cause and effect that govern the dynamics of the natural world and thus the interactions of people and situations. In the context of what we are describing here, the cause of human behavior was the "per- manent environment" of the Stanford Prison. And the impact it had on some of these human beings was much more than the normal social desirability of human beings (and it certainly wasn't the most benign of outcomes!) We must be careful when reading the words of psychologists in these matters. For many, it is tempting to fall into a kind of knee-jerk moral panic, to assume that every little thing we don't like in our own lives must in fact be caused by some dark force out there who will use those things to make us miserable and unhappy on this planet. This is not always the case. If for some reason you feel that way, consider looking into some of the possibilities offered by the philosopher Robert Anton Wilson who wrote, "You don't have a planet for your problems." The Stanford Prison experiment had a very positive impact on some humans. It also had a negative impact on others, however. As a result of the psychological travails that they were involved in, many of the participants in the study eventually came to see some of their most significant relationship partners as more evil than good, as less human than human and as less worthy of their love and caring than them. Some of the participants began to doubt the very meaning of existence itself. These negative results should serve as a warning against the temptation to make moral, legal, or even ethical judgments based on an abstract, universal, and "noble" theory of justice rather than the specific examples that emerge from every- day life. It is not surprising that in- dividuals' subjective moral judgments can differ widely as a result of the specific context in which moral, legal, and ethical dilemmas arise. The context does matter, and that can seriously compromise one's capacity to judge objectively, rationally, and fairly based on objective criteria. Consider the example of the person who, as a member of an all- white police department, is faced with a black police officer who refuses to allow him to arrest a criminal, much less shoot the criminal who is threatening him. How can the person not judge the black officer to be a greater threat to his safety and well-being? Is the black officer an inherently more moral person than the white cop? Does the objective truth of what is a more "moral" situation dictate any of the differences? Of course not. The context matters. It is not the objective standard- ing that makes the difference. The context is always relative to the individual and his experience at that moment. There is no one objective ethical standard, but each of us will arrive at a similar and different ethical standard based on our individual context and the specific circumstances of what is in front of us. The context is our window into the world and our key to what is truly going on. It can also decide whether the world as we perceive it is actually what is going on. At the Stanford Prison Experiment, we examined a total situation in which a group of healthy young adults of both sexes who were, most of the time, good apples were placed in an environment so unnatural, inhospitable, and threatening that it almost changed the way they experienced

 that govern most human behaviors, both in private and in the political realm. Some- times it requires great efforts to resist temptations to become evil; sometimes, it is all too easy to fall prey to the allure of power in a more overt and more direct manner. As long as humans can remain moral and upright, they will, like any natural species, have the potential to become highly successful "good apples" and thus be good citizens and social scientists. In his classic, The Social Construction of Reality (1980), cognitive scientist and human- tological anthropologist Steven Pinker describes human nature as "a vast and deep reservoir of predispositions, dispositions, instincts, and other elements of consciousness that have yet to be organized into conscious systems. If a biological system can become conscious, it can be modi- fied, altered, and re-created in other bodies, and can thus be re-programmed." Although many of my participants were the very same people who had gone through psychoanalytic treatment for serious mental illness, we were not, in this context, the psychoanalysts. We were simply experimental subjects whose cognitive and behavioral responses resembled those that are often observed in individuals who were being "treated" in the traditional psychoanalytic sense. In fact, many of them were quite pleased to have been asked if we had been "treated" at all. 1 As psychologist Jerome Kagan points out the Stanford Prison can be considered more analogous to what is called an "extrinsic setting" (cognitively dissociative, as opposed to intrinsic). 2 As Kagan himself notes, "These prisoners had not been involved in political campaigns, nor were they involved in other events and struggles of this type. . . . They had no interest in politics and had little knowledge of what has come to be called 'politics' generally, let alone in the specific political issues." The Stanford Prison represents the culmination of two decades of laboratory-based research with human volunteers. The results are not surprising to me. In my field, a decade ago, I conducted another experiment with a group of "re- duced persons" who had participated in long-term psychoanalytic treatment. These subjects had been deprived of their primary sense of identity and their primary sense of autonomy, but had been maintained from childhood as essentially "good," "normal" persons as the result of prolonged repression, or, as the social scientists call it, "reinforcement." This study found that the normal "good" persons who, under traditional psychoanalytic management, emerged as "repression-resistant" people ended up re-con- cerned by their own repression and became increasingly re-assertive. A number of the Stanford Prison volunteers, like their colleagues in Kagan's study, were "reinforced" by the repression and were also, as Kagan notes, "repressive." To these researchers, the participants were simply victims of "repression." To me and my associates, the prisoners came to see me as their rescuers. I told them, when they were first brought into my laboratory, that my interest in them was not solely that they might be "repressed" prisoners in this prison, but rather that they might also be ordinary non-re- stricted persons in other contexts that can have negative and adverse effects on "good" citizens and social scientists (such as the Palo Alto group, in part because they were members of the National Lawyers Guild). These scientists were not normal, not repressed, just normal. Although they may have been, for some reason, in the "good" category under the traditional psychoanalytic scheme, they were still human and, consequently, the potential for change was immense.

A new episode of NBC's The Night Shift left fans wondering what had become of Alaric and Maggie—two characters who were killed last season during the storyline, The Man in the Suit. Fans quickly speculated that Alaric was alive and well in Atlanta, with the city's police force believing Maggie was dead and attempting to track her down in their place, which also led to her "escaping" the country.

Alaric was apparently also in the back of a police car with his kidnapper, a mystery solved in the episode entitled "The Man in the Suit." Though we don't know much about the Man in the Suit, we do know he's a new mysterious criminal mastermind. While the Man in the Suit didn't kidnap Maggie in the Season 2 finale, his story wasn't yet complete: Maggie did kill him in Season 3, and he was killed again in the Season 5 debut of The Blacklist.

The episode's writer, Jon Bokenkamp, told EW that he wanted to continue the murder plotline, even after Maggie and Alaric were killed. "It's important to know that there's a mystery in front of us; it's not something you get to decide. They

Inside linebacker Curtis Lofton has been targeted 16 times in coverage over the first five weeks. All 16 targets were converted into receptions and two for touchdowns. He's clearly struggling to defend the middle of the field. Ball should expect to step in on obvious passing downs.

Lofton once played a vital role as a run-stopper. According to Pro Football Focus, he grades as a minus-1.9 in run defense. Norton may opt to limit his snaps or lean on Ball to maintain the Raiders' stout fourth-ranked rush defense. The rookie linebacker has potentially found a niche as a coverage linebacker that serves as his claim to a starting spot next to Malcolm Smith.

 for this, which has been evidenced by Oakland's league-leading 14 interceptions.

As usual, Edwards will benefit from an extra week of preparation in the classroom and in the weight room. His presence on the field could serve as a positive spark for the group. However, it's imperative that he is able to produce as a pass rusher, which seems highly unlikely on his debut performance. Still, there's no denying that he's having fun in the classroom while working on his craft with other players in the building in San Diego.

"It's just another week," Edwards said. "There's not too much that's going on. Nothing new comes up. If there is something new that's fresh for me, or something new that will help me continue to improve my game, I'll use it."

The good news is that even though he hasn't started, he's certainly doing his part.

"It's different. Playing football is always a challenge," Edwards said. "If you're not prepared, you're in for the long haul. It's the same thing if you were in high school versus college and you played in the big game. You have to be able to do it over and over again. You can't think about that. You just have to be ready when the opportunity arises. That's just what I have to do as well as the coaches and the other guys that are here."

The statement comes in the wake of the IIT allowing 12-to-14-year-olds to join as students on Monday. This comes at a time when the Maharashtra government is trying to roll back the minimum mandatory age for admission to engineering colleges. While Maharashtra's education department had opposed the institute's decision, the Sena, with some members holding senior positions in the state government, came down heavily on the minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju "We are very disappointed that Kiren Rijiju has taken this decision. The minister, who is representing the state in the Centre, should be at least responsible for these decisions," said Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut.Rijiju had on September 30 said he would not allow any more black students to become students as a sign of "social responsibility". After the controversy erupted, he reversed that decision. On September 30 morning, in a meeting held at the IIT premises with IIT Roorkee (Delhi), the ministry of HRD agreed to look into the matter and "we were happy to do so," said an official present in the meeting. But the official added that once the government started to relax norms in engineering colleges, such as allowing students below the age of 18 to get admission, the IIT had decided to allow the recruitment of more black candidates.This development came after the government had said it would start implementing the new admissions norms later in the day. However, on September 30, the government allowed more than 30 students to join IIT Roorkee.The IIT on Monday said that it extended its offer to the students on the basis of a "letter of acceptance" from students in the hostels and in the hostel association.<|endoftext|>The most common question that comes up in the Ask a Tech Question forum is not about how to get a job but about finding a place to live when leaving a job.

, scoring on 24.3 percent of their offensive possessions. The Raiders rank 22nd against the run and have made the second-fewest tackles for loss, but both players need to step up.

The rest of defensive line will also remain consistent. The Raiders are second on the NFL in sacks and the fourth-highest-rated run defense, per Football Outsiders.

With no issues at nose tackle, the Raiders rely on the interior to hold opposing teams in check—something they will continue to do to maintain the No. 1 spot.<|endoftext|>When it comes to the economy and the stock market, the stock market has returned to its historic trend since the start of 2012. In fact, it should be a safe bet that if the current economic performance were to continue, the S&P 500 would reach 23,543 by the end of 2016.

If the S&P 500 was to maintain its current rate of 23,543, a total of 1.35 trillion dollars would be in the market at that time with $1.09 trillion going to the top 1 percent and $4.15 trillion going to the top 1% of the country.

The first time the S&P 500 reached 23,543 would have been just before the Great Depression. A total of 2,100 stocks would have been in the market at this time with $2.65 trillion invested in them.

What the stock market did during the last five years has been nothing but extraordinary. In the five years following the financial crisis in 2008, the S&P 500 stock market fell by 80%.

At the beginning of the year 2007, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was just below 17,000. After several corrections the Dow would reach 12,100 in March of 2008 and then fall to 7,950 in September. It would then bounce back from that initial low in November of 2008, reaching 17,000 the following month. The Dow would hold steady at its new level of 17,001 for a total of 18,000 until it fell to 6,845 the December of 2009. It would be lower than that for a total of 15 years until the June of 2016.

It was a similar story when it came to the Nasdaq. In the first five years after the 2000 Presidential election, the NASDAQ would fall to a low of 1,960. By June of 2000, it reached a peak of 5,058 before the Nasdaq would rise further.

In the second half of the decade, the NASDAQ would fall from its peak by 2,081 before rebounding to a high of 5,065 in July of 2003. It would plummet by 1,049 the month after that to reach 1,892 the following month before reaching its recent peak in November of 2003 which held close to 17,000

The last time the S&P 500 would reach 23,543 is likely on the dot-com crash in May of 1999. The NASDAQ would fall from its peak of 16,976 to 3,500 on May 1, 1999. The Dow would then fall by 2,897 and it would make an all-time high of 29,200 on September 11, 1999.

For the rest of the next ten years, the NASDAQ would fall by a total of 10,837 and the Dow would drop by 2,871 before climbing back to its recent high (29,210) in April of 2006.

In the next 10 years, the NASDAQ would fall by a total of 6,963 before a recovery of 3,744 and the Dow would fall by 1,917. Since it reached its low, there have been one new peak

 for the team's lack of pass rush. When they found success, it was often the results of their talented running backs.

"I think those (runs) were really hard to come by that week," Edwards said to NFL.com. "We didn't have any kind of run support and they just kind of picked their poison. They didn't have to be very creative. We just didn't really take to the run. So, those were some of the hard games."

As the Raiders will learn, their season-ending loss in Miami was as much a failure on their part. They failed to contain the Dolphins' offensive and defensive lines.

It's clear that a player who gives opposing defenses fits will be a must-have at this point for the Raiders. If the coaching staff wants a big push in 2015, the former first-round pick might be all the defense needs.<|endoftext|>DETROIT, MI - A Detroit-based activist has launched a fundraising campaign for the family of Freddie Gray.

Graphic, disturbing and graphic, the "Justice for Freddie Gray" video depicts police brutality and leads with the statement:

There is a body still being held on the streets in Ferguson, MO, and we will not let it happen in Detroit.

Gray died in April while in police custody, and police are still investigating his death.

According to the Free Thought Project, the "Justice for Freddie Gray" campaign -- which started on Aug. 21 with a fundraising goal of $1 million -- raised over $3 million.

The videos are disturbing to watch and not for the squeamish.

On May 20, 2015, Freddie Gray was in a police van for approximately 10 hours while being detained. This video was captured from inside the van by one of the officers who was recording the incident.

The officer can be heard telling people not to get out of the car, instructing them to "stay right here" and ordering a woman who was on the outside of the bus to leave the vehicle.

"Now you're being very confrontational," the man filming says on the video. "Get your fucking hands up. Show me your fucking hands. Don't move."

While they were being detained, an officer can be seen dragging the man on the ground. The man filming can be heard telling him to wait, to which he then responds: "You fucking beat him? Why you beat him? Why you beat him?"

In yet another video, you can see officers placing Gray face down on the hood of the van where medical examiners later pronounced the 21-year-old dead from injuries sustained in the van.

In video with text that has since been posted on the campaign's webpage, the unidentified victim identified as Freddie Gray can be seen laying on the street.

The videos are disturbing for obvious reasons; however, the situation in Ferguson, Mo and elsewhere around the world has also shown that police brutality is rampant for many reasons, not just a lack of police training or equipment.

It is time for law enforcement to be held accountable and held accountable for the lack of protection and the excessive use of force by those that they serve.

 for the run weakness. In order to limit yards rushing with a young core of run-stopers, the team may need to rotate in other players to help out the young linebackers.

If the young linebackers continue to improve offensively, it will only be a matter of time before the coaching staff switches them to the field. As a unit, the Oakland defense may not be as talented as 2015, but its performance against the run allowed them to win their division. The Raiders must find themselves a pass-rusher that can consistently bring pressure and the young linebacking corps must develop.

edit] What is the Orcs? First, it is known that they are a race of giant warlords: the Orcs are a "humanlike" tribe whose civilization, "Mud Run', was originally established by the giants. They are nomadic and rarely live in cities (although some of them have established settlements). They have been the main enemies of every major civilization (excepting the Dwarves, but they still attack them from time to time) since the Age of Legends, when they raided their way to victory over the Dwarves. The Orcs have long histories of civil conflict, in both war and peace, in every period except the Age of Legends and the First Era. During the First Empire era, they made peace with the Elves and with each other, but during the Age of Legends and the Second Era, they were at war with the other races, the Giants in particular. And, of course, they were at war again during the Third Era. The Orc race in the World of Middle-earth is one of the most advanced of all elves -- having developed the knowledge of magic that their fellow elves lack, as well as the art of war and the craft of writing: the Orcs are a highly advanced race and also the most aggressive and warlike, not only of all the elves, but also of all the races of men (save the Men of the Misty Mountains, whom they despise). Most of the Orcs are strong and tough without being overly strong and tough, with the exception of the Warboss Haug the Stout, Orc King and Lord of Mournhold. In both times, they have made a strong pact with the Elves of Middle-earth that they won't attack each other for as long as possible, and each "partner" has kept to this agreement and it has meant that Orcs have often been regarded as the more powerful creatures amongst the Elves. The Elves have allied with the Dwarves in the Second Era as well -- though this is not a recent event, it was only in the Third Era that they began to ally themselves with the races against the threat of the Empire. The Dwarves helped the Elves, and Orcs helped the Dwarves. The Dwarves and Orcs were the main enemies of every other race in the Third Era. At the end of the Third Era, the Elves made peace with the Dwarves once more and they have not attacked their fellow Elf kindred since. The Dwarves have also made peace with the Orcs to their detriment. The Orcs and the Dwarves of that era are still as fierce enemies as they were in the years preceding the First and Second Empires. Since the Third Era, the Orcs and the Elves have become the main enemies of all races in Middle-earth, with the Giants the second largest enemy race. The First Empire, when it ruled Middle-earth, had not been completely defeated and the armies of Númenor and Gondor were strong, and both were allies of the Elves and the Dwarves and both were

Subject: the day they brought me into the fold I was a few kids in elementary school and saw this show. I was a total kid when it started and just loved dancin'. I don't know why, but I loved it all the way until it went away. Then, I never heard the old stuff since. Finally, I got to be a deadhead. I can't say that I would have found out if I never saw it myself, but if they hadn't given me the show(and i didn't find out about it until much more later) I wouldn't have become a deadhead. I really wish someone would explain to me that. If it wasn't for Dancin' and the rest of the tunes that I liked when I got to college, I would of been the guy that never did the thing that I'm glad I did.

We had about ten people in the band, with Jerry, Pigpen, Bruce Hornsby, Brent on sax, and Bobby on piano/bass. It was good-sounding. I'm amazed at how good all this music was. This show and this version are very similar from beginning to end.


At the time Jerry seemed a bit out-of-tune on lead vocals. I remember seeing them at an early performance there in 1971. It was a really cool, funky show. - January 22, 2005It's all one big mystery

In retrospect, I think Jerry's playing had been getting a bit stiffer as his career was winding down.


To make this even more intriguing, the second set is also pretty short! I've been listening for years to old tapes of a lot of shows, and this is one of the shortest.

The report, the most recent data available from the Bureau, also shows that nearly 2m more have graduated from college than four years ago. Over the period 1994-2002, the number of college graduates increased by nearly 4 million, or 8%, while the total number of Americans with only a high school education or less decreased by 4.4 million, or 5%.


The largest percentage change was the 11.6 million increase in high school graduates, to reach 4.2 million, or 15% of the population.


"We look back on our nation's rise from poverty to prosperity on the shoulders of the people, families who work and do their part and support their children in school," said Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States. "Today, thanks to President Bush, America is one of the best and hardest hit nations in the world to achieve a college degree. But this progress can't have been made without the hard work of each and every one of you."


"The fact that more Americans are now in college underscores the success of President Bush's initiative, the No Child Left Behind Act, which is now reaching all Americans, creating more opportunity in every community," added Vice President Dick Cheney.


This year's report includes data on the nation's largest cities. Overall population changes in the top 25 largest metro areas in the United States over the last year have been consistent with those reported over the previous four-year period, with the biggest increases in Washington D.C. and New York City. New York has seen the largest percentage increase among non-metro cities in the United States.


The numbers for New York City have grown by nearly 40% over the last four years, with the city now the nation's largest metropolis, and Washington has grown by 17%, with a population of over 827,000 people.


As a result of the increases, New York's and Washington's populations have topped the 1 million mark for the second straight year, but New York City's share of the total U.S. population has decreased slightly from 18.6% in 1994 to 18.5% in 1999.


In addition, there were substantial increases in several states and metro areas, led by New Jersey with a 14% increase, Michigan with 10%, Virginia with 9%, Massachusetts and California with 8% each, and Virginia Beach, Fla. and San Bernardino on the rise with 5% each. The nation's largest metros--Dallas-Fort Worth (Taco Bell), Los Angeles (Taco Bell), Phoenix, and Orlando--each witnessed a 2%+ increase, the fastest growth of the top 25 metros in the United States over the last year.


For the second consecutive year, New Jersey has the largest increase in high school graduates among the nation's metropolitan areas in the United States. The state added over 400,000 high school graduates, or 17%, in the last year.


Since 1994, the number of college graduates in

The State Department confirmed the death on Thursday in a statement. It said the department was working with other government agencies to help with the investigation. Kirby said the family asked that the State Department not release any details about Diana Nyad's time in the department at this time.

Nyad, 64, had been in an undisclosed location in Haiti since Oct. 22, according to Kaitlin L. Paine, spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs.

"We are deeply saddened by the passing of a valued colleague. Her family has asked for privacy during this difficult time," Kirby said in the statement.

When she arrived at the U.S. Embassy in New York in 2007, Nyad was on a four-month posting in New York. She had been a constitutional lawyer who had worked on the World Court, the United Nations and other U.N. roles, and had recently returned to civilian duty as a prosecutor at the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.

Even if you know what an iPhone screen is like, your chances of success drop significantly without the help of some basic iOS 8 tips.

For example, you may have noticed that as soon as you press the Home button on your iOS device or simply hit the back button on your Mac, the lock animation begins. This ensures that anyone can't get to your device by accident, even if they have physical access. With an iOS device locked, it's crucial that you don't miss any important messages or notifications.

Even though this lock screen is super cool, you won't see your notifications, so it's important to take advantage of every opportunity you can to take a screenshot of your screen.

Here are some common pitfalls that you could fall into when taking an iPhone screenshot, as well as some helpful tips to take a screenshot of your iOS device using an iPhone or iPad.

1. The screen just won't automatically go blank

With an iOS device locked, an easy way to quickly get to the Lock screen is to use Slide Over. In Slide Over, you can only do so if you are actually looking at a full screen, in-application iPhone or iPad (iPad Mini or larger). For the most part, iPhones and iPads do not automatically go blank when you lock them.

When you're in an app, or looking at the Lock screen itself, the iPhone or iPad will always stay on screen. You can also turn the Touch ID sensor on and off with the Settings menu in iPhone iOS 8 and iPad OS X Yosemite (not available on iPhone 4s). It won't make a difference on an iPhone 6s.

2. It's impossible to take an iOS screenshot

It's not always straightforward to take a screenshot using iOS. Luckily, there are some tricks to make it happen.

In your iOS Settings, there should be a Camera icon that shows up with a small arrow over it. Tap on that and an option called Take Screenshot should be in your choices. Tap that and tap either a small square icon at

On this postal card mailed on April 21, 1889, Bertha S. Witzell, probably a Library Company staff member, writes a congratulatory note to Albert Durham, the new director of the Reading Public Library in Reading, PA. on his appointment.

The Ridgeway Library building was given to the Library Company in 1878 as the result of an earlier bequest of almost a million dollars from Dr. James Rush. The building was reluctantly accepted by the Library Company and was never used as the primary service point of the Library. This picture postcard of the Ridgeway Library was mailed to England in 1904.

The story follows the lives of two families who are divided by the pet-store clerk who is turned into a toy by an unexpected guest.

The film recently played at the Berlin Film Festival.

The pic is from Sony Pictures Releasing and the Lionsgate purchase is part of Liongate's aggressive push into German-speaking territories. The Lion's Gate film library includes the popular "The Hunger Games" and "Troy."

Belichick, who knows a thing or two about the automobile after having owned some in 10 NFL seasons, took time Tuesday to explain the Bronco from the inside out (or at least as much as he could remember with 20 NFL wins and the 2000 season being the closest thing to an off season of his life, anyway), with a story of his own involving a white van that he and his brother once drove to a NASCAR race in Pennsylvania.

Belichick spoke of the white van on a Monday conference call that a few thousand people participated in to hear what the Patriots' head coach had to say for himself about his two Super Bowl victories. It's Belichick's first time having such a discussion in more than 19 years, as he is not in touch with many of his former players.

"I remember that I took a friend of mine from Penn State, and I remember that I drove him over as a favor," said Belichick, whose brother and Bill's son, Tom, is an assistant in New England. "And then, he won the race, and after he won the race, he told me I drove him over. And, so, now the question is, did I drive him over or not? I'm no closer to that answer."

The car?

"Oh, you mean the Ford Bronco? No, you didn't know the Bronco," Belichick said, laughing. "I don't even remember where we went. I remember driving him from one place to another place. And, we won the race."

Belichick did remember having a conversation about a white van with his now-former friend, who Belichick didn't identify, about that exact time. It just didn't

On this postal card mailed on April 21, 1889, Bertha S. Witzell, probably a Library Company staff member, writes a congratulatory note to Albert Durham, the new director of the Reading Public Library in Reading, PA. on his appointment.

The Ridgeway Library building was given to the Library Company in 1878 as the result of an earlier bequest of almost a million dollars from Dr. James Rush. The building was reluctantly accepted by the Library Company and was never used as the primary service point of the Library. This picture postcard of the Ridgeway Library was mailed to England in 1904.

George Maurice Abbot served as Librarian of the Library Company from November 7, 1907 to June 30, 1929. This postal card from Abbot was mailed on January 20, 1911 to the Librarian of the Egyptian University in Cairo to acknowledge a gift.

To help celebrate the 275th anniversary of the Library Company of Philadelphia I became a share holder of the Library Company. On January 17, 2006 I was reissued Share No. 508 which was

 used as a mailing stamp in order to give away to someone in the library who would otherwise not have had a chance to purchase the card. To date, more than 500 copies of this stamp have been made – most of them to people who have passed away as well as to friends who have been living here in Philadelphia for years.

Shareholder-only postcards are only mailed by the Librarian of the Library Company. After January 16, 2018 there will no longer be any new members or shareholders who can purchase the card.

If you are interested in purchasing a share of the Librarian of the Library Company of Baltimore, MD please call me at (410) 566-6177.

But late Friday, the House of Representatives passed legislation that the Senate had previously rejected, ending bulk collection and reinstating a court-approved program that the NSA says was used to identify and stop hundreds of terrorism-linked plots, Reuters reported.

The USA Freedom Act passed by a vote of 257 to 157 without any opposition from Republicans, according to The Associated Press. The bill also restores many of the NSA's other surveillance programs, including a program to collect the "transferred" call numbers, according to The Guardian. The government would not be allowed to look at the content of or records from the telecommunications records.

The move does not end U.S. government bulk collection of the phone records that were collected by the NSA under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Still, it's a big start, and it is the first time in two years that a House majority opposed bulk collection of records on Americans, Reuters noted.

The vote on Friday was the third and final vote on an appropriations bill that funds the Pentagon and other federal agencies.

A second version of the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed the Senate in November 2013 but was vetoed by President Barack Obama, would also have ended bulk collection under Section 215.

But a procedural vote that required support from 60 senators—a super-majority—left passage of the Freedom Act in doubt.

Instead, the two bills will go to a conference committee to resolve the disagreements and reach a compromise that both parties can agree to.

"We're getting to a place where we can agree the program in the Senate is not working and we need to go back to the drawing board on this program," Rep. Blake Farenthold—R-Texas, chairman of the House Republican Conference—told reporters Friday.

That compromise measure is expected to be finalized this week.

The Freedom Act is sponsored by Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner

 sold to an anonymous shareholder shortly afterwards. After I was notified of the change in ownership through the Library Company on February 2, 2006 I contacted the Shareholder Services Center of the Company to verify that my name had not been taken. That night I was informed that the last name on the share transfer form was not my proper name. However, after contacting the Shareholder Services Center the company had my name corrected and sent shares with two boxes with my new name in the address. In 2006 I was notified of this mistake only through the public record. I have asked for this to be changed on the company's website but have been told that the Company cannot do this since the shares were transferred legally from the Librarian of the Library to the Shareholder through the proper channels. I am not familiar with what those proper channels are and therefore I have contacted the Secretary to have the shares altered on the company's website.

I don't know who this is but there seems to be a lot of fun in sharing.<|endoftext|>"To build bridges, you have to walk across a bridge," said Richard Branson. What many of us don't know is how he got there.


In the '80s, when Virgin Galactic was trying to get in the commercial space business, Branson's then-business partner Richard Branson took the company to a desert ranch in the Mojave desert of California where he and his wife Joan were looking for a place that would be the perfect base to launch their private spaceflight service. Their goal was to build a large launch facility as well as a hotel to host guests that would then be outfitted with spacecraft. But it wasn't long into their trip that Virgin Galactic's founder saw something that he says he had dreamed about ever since he was a kid on a summer vacation.


According to an interview he did with Wired magazine , Branson was walking through the Mojave desert and just kept looking into the horizon.


"I remember looking around and seeing this massive blue-white nebula in the sky," he said. "And I remember saying, 'I think we'll build a space hotel in here.'"


After that idea proved to be viable, Branson's company would launch its first customer in 1989 and would be awarded a contract by NASA, which would make Virgin Galactic its primary provider of SpaceShipOne to carry tourists to suborbital space. In 1993, he and Sir Richard went on to complete what became one of the most famous flights of the Space Shuttle Program.


"It was all set up, and everything was well in order," Branson said in the Wired article. "So Richard and I went into an observation room in the control center, and I told him, 'When we're ready to blast off, when everything is up and running, and we can get up off this wall, I want to go and take a photograph of it. It's probably a first in the history of mankind.' "<|endoftext|>The following article is in response to an article that was published in the New York Times this week, "How Can America Prevent the Worst Ebola Cases?" The article describes how the government can reduce the Ebola threat by ensuring that health care workers receive training and protective equipment and by building more public health infrastructure to deal with the virus. The article implies that we cannot do any better—yet, we have done much worse than those who have lived with the virus for decades.

Here are 10 things that are even worse than the scenario presented in the article:

1. The article uses "Ebola" as a general term for any of the many different diseases currently circulating in West Africa.

2. Even more dangerous than describing Ebola as a disease is trying to treat Ebola's symptoms. As the NY Times article

As you view this collection of images from the Library Company of Philadelphia you'll notice some common themes among all the various postcards.

Many of the postcards were probably mailed after the Library Company moved out of the building but they're from before that. In a way these postcards are a snapshot of the past. Many were probably printed between 1908 and 1920 because the Library Company took over the building that year. Some of the postcards even look a little dated. Many look like they were meant to be printed in the 1920s. You can also see some of the interesting postcards that aren't from before the Library Company moved out of this building.

When the Library Company was moved into the building they left behind a number of interesting postcards not seen anywhere else. The postal cards that have been mailed to the Library Company from the 1900s are pretty interesting. They're generally of the same type and color as anything else in the Library Company's collection. These old postal cards are usually quite rare.

To view more images of postcards mailed before they moved into the Library Company click the Library Company links at the top of this page.

In the summer of 2005 I was given a collection of postcards that had been sent by one of the original owners who was also a postmaster in the early 1900s. In that collection was a large amount of old postcards, some were postage prepaid and others with check or money order deposits inside. In this collection of postcards this deposit has been changed to cash. Most of the postcards are from the Library Company in the 1890s and early 1900s, some of these were from outside collections. It is thought that this group of deposit postcards came from private collections and it is interesting that so many of the deposits to the Post Office of Pennsylvania were made with pennies.

Here are some of the Postal Cards I received from Robert and Annie Hatton as they were mailed to them and their families after the Library Company moved out of that building. To see more of these old Postcards see the Archives of the Library Company of Philadelphia Postcard Collection. These postcards from the Library Company can be purchased from the Library Company, The Bicentennial Center, 2300 S. 9th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104.

One of the few postcards from before the Library Company moved into the building. The Postcards in this collection have an unusual form. The envelope at the left has the Library Company name and address printed in tiny writing on white paper. Then at the right are the words "Library Company of Philadelphia" and at bottom left of the picture there is a list of names with mailing address.

An envelope from the Library Company of Philadelphia with "Library Company of Philadelphia" handwritten on the side. A list of names, addresses and mailing addresses.

This postcard mailed to the Library Company office on March 8, 1909 appears to be part of a public service announcement to inform library patrons where they could access information on how to open the public library of Pennsylvania. The other side of the postcard says "Public Library of Pennsylvania" inside a colored circle with a red circle at the top with the words "Public Library of the United States."

Postcard No. 1 (Postmarked April 20, 1898) This postcard was mailed to William P. Schmitt, President of the Pennsylvania Association. It's in excellent condition.

This model has two variables, M1 and L1. In the long run, the interest rate (M1) equals the value of M (or the central bank's target rate with its target at zero). In the short run, each variable changes independently as the level of investment (L1) is held constant. In the long run, L1 should equal the central bank's balance sheet minus the cash balance of the federal government (M). In the short run, M should equal L1. In the long run, by definition, M2 = L1 + H + B. This is because the model represents the Fed as acting as a nominal demand-sink.

The central bank, the FOMC, has several tools available to it. It can purchase assets by creating additional reserves, which adds "money" and makes it easier to sell the bonds at the stated value. It can lower the target rate by buying Treasury securities or corporate debt, which reduces the nominal demand for Treasuries and puts pressure on the yield in those securities. It can reduce the target rate from that target by raising the base interest rate, and the FOMC chooses to do so whenever the actual (real) rate exceeds the target rate.

SEAL Team 1 members Jason Moszer and Jacob Hall were sent in to free an American and a Dutch citizen after their remote base was hit by an explosion.

The pair came under attack from Afghan insurgents as they made their way through the volatile mountains of southern Helmand province, where the militants are in control of two districts.

"They were attacked in the area where the U.S.-led coalition has been fighting insurgents for five years," a local security official told Reuters.

"They were the last Americans who came from the United States" to Helmand, he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

A second U.S. military official confirmed the two were part of a two-man team that had been sent in by American and Nato officials after the two failed to reach the base. Neither would identify them.

In addition to the U.S. national, the two Dutch citizens were carrying a backpack and equipment.

A local security official said the attack was launched shortly after 2 p.m. local time Friday in Achin district, on the southern outskirts of Helmand.

The U.S. military launched air and ground operations and special forces to drive out militants from the strategic area in August 2014.

As they advanced, Taliban fighters dug in around the perimeter of the base - blocking the approach to the air
